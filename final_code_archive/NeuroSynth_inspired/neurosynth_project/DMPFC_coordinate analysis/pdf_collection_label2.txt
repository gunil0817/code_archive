To illustrate how such approaches can be used to investigate sex diﬀerences in neurocognition, we applied the multivariate technique of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to an fMRI dataset obtained during performance of mental rotation – a classic visuospatial task known to give rise to sex diﬀerences in performance. In agreement with prior results obtained using univariate methods, PCA identiﬁed a core mental rotation network (principal component [PC]1, accounting for 53.1% of total variance) that included activation of bilateral frontal, parietal, occipital and occipitotemporal regions. Expression of PC1 was similar in men and women, and was positively correlated with level of education. PC2, which accounted for 5.7% of total variance, was diﬀerentially expressed by men and women, and indicated greater mental rotation-associated neural activity in women in such highorder cortical regions such as prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule, in accord with prior ﬁndings, and with the idea that women may take a more ‘‘top-down’’ approach to mental rotation. By quantifying, in a data-driven fashion, the contribution of factors such as sex and education to patterns of brain activity, these ﬁndings put the magnitude of neural sex diﬀerences during mental rotation into perspective, conﬁrming the commonsense notion that, as humans, men and women are more alike than they are diﬀerent, with between-individual variability (such as level of education, which, importantly, is modiﬁable) generally outweighing between-sex variability. This work exempliﬁes the role that multivariate analysis can play in identifying brain functional networks, and in quantifying their involvement under speciﬁc conditions and in diﬀerent populations.

Butler et al. / Clinical Neuroscience Research 6 (2007) 391–398  Whether men and women diﬀer in their thinking styles and/or abilities is a controversial topic of great interest to neuroscientists as well to the lay public. Sex diﬀerences are also important in the context of many medical and psychiatric disorders which have a diﬀerent incidence or course depending on sex. An increasing number of functional neuroimaging studies document sex diﬀerences during the performance of various cognitive and emotional tasks (for review see [1]). Based on these studies, it is clear that participant sex must be considered when designing functional neuroimaging studies and interpreting results. What remains less clear is the precise nature and magnitude of sex eﬀects; even using a well-studied paradigm such as mental rotation [2] (a visuospatial task known to give rise to robust sex diﬀerences in performance), reported functional neuroanatomical sex diﬀerences have been variable [3–7], or absent [4,8,9], though greater frontal activity in women has been found in the majority of studies [3,6,10], including one from our group [11]. While much of this variability is likely due to diﬀerent experimental paradigms and methods of analysis, it must be acknowledged that some variability is likely due to the moderate size of the sex eﬀect, as well as to non-systematic diﬀerences in performance strategy. Certainly, as humans, men and women are more alike than they are diﬀerent, with between-individual variability (such as education levels) generally outweighing between-sex variability. It is a limitation of functional imaging studies using categorical analyses (contrasting men to women) that only those differences highly localized in space are detected.  Multivariate methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provide a means to quantify the contribution of factors such as sex to patterns of brain activity in terms of the relationship between brain regions/networks, without deciding beforehand which factors are relevant. PCA enables decomposition of a collection of three dimensional, voxel-wise condition-dependent eﬀect images of participants (be it a single group or multiple groups) into a cascade of uncorrelated component images, in descending order based on how much variation in the data is explained at each stage, where a projection direction is pursued to maximize the variation in the remaining data being expressed based on the covariance structure of the eﬀect image collection. The resulting loading scores of each component image (i.e., eigenimage or spatial mode), which deﬁne the amount of contribution to this speciﬁc component image from each participant, can then be examined against various factors of interest (such as demographic indices and clinical scores). Related analyses of resting state data by Eidelberg and associates (e.g. [12,13] and other review articles in this issue) have provided important, clinically-relevant information concerning Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders.  In the study described below, we applied PCA to an existing fMRI dataset [11,14] to examine the contribution of sex and other factors (age, education, performance accuracy, reaction time, perceived task diﬃculty) to dis tributed patterns of brain activity. We discuss aspects of PCA relevant speciﬁcally to condition-dependent activation studies, and compare PCA results to previouslyreported results [11] obtained using standard voxel-wise univariate factorial repeated-measures ANOVA. We also discuss a complementary voxel-wise measure of functional connectivity between an investigator-designated ‘‘seed’’ region and the rest of the brain, and how results obtained using such a thresholded correlational approach [15] diﬀer from those obtained using PCA and related approaches. Potential uses for network approaches to cognitive and clinical neuroscientiﬁc problems are discussed in this context.  2. Materials and methods  fMRI datasets from 25 healthy, right-handed subjects [13 women (mean age 28.6, std 7.5); 12 men (mean age 30.1, std 5.9)] were analyzed for this study, which was approved by the Weill-Cornell Institutional Review Board.  2.1. Task  Using a validated, computerized version of the classic Shepard and Metzler mental rotation task [2,16], cube ﬁgures were presented in pairs (Fig. 1). Stimuli pairs were either the same, but rotated with respect to one another (‘‘same’’ trials) or they were mirror images of each other (‘‘diﬀerent’’ trials). Stimuli were rotated by either 40°, 80°, 120° or 160°. Participants were instructed to mentally rotate ﬁgures into alignment in order to decide if they were the same or diﬀerent. Accuracy and reaction time (RT) were recorded. An active control condition consisted of pairs of ﬁgures which were either identical or mirror images which were not rotated with respect to one another. Stimuli were presented in ﬁve-trial blocks, interspersed with a resting baseline condition (visual ﬁxation). Additional details of this paradigm are available elsewhere [11,16]. After scanning, subjects completed a questionnaire about their experience and marked a 10 cm visual analog scale labeled ‘‘easy’’ and ‘‘hard’’ at each end. Average accuracy (proportion of correct responses) and reaction time for correct trials were calculated for each subject.  2.2. Image acquisition  (EPI)  ﬂip  (TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms;  Image data were acquired on one of two identical GE Signa 3 T MRI scanners (max gradient strength 40 mT/m, max gradient slew rate 150 T/m/s; General Electric Company, Waukesha, WI) using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Approximately equal numbers of men and women were scanned on each scanner. After shimming to maximize homogeneity, a series of fMRI scans was collected using gradient echo echo-planar imagangle = 70°, ing FoV = 240 mm; 27 slices; 5 mm thickness with 1 mm inter-slice space; matrix = 64 · 64). Images were acquired over the whole brain parallel to the AC–PC plane. The ﬁrst six volumes of each epoch were discarded. A reference T1 weighted anatomical image with the same slice placement and thickness and a matrix of 256 · 256 was acquired immediately preceding the EPI acquisition. This high-resolution T1 weighted anatomical image was acquired using a spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) acquisition sequence with a resolution of 0.9375 · 0.9375 · 1.5 mm3.  T.

Participants were instructed to mentally rotate pairs of ﬁgures into alignment in order to decide if they were the same or diﬀerent. This ﬁgure was taken from [11] and used with publisher’s permission.  2.3. Image processing and analysis  Image processing performed within a customized Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM99) software package (www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) included manual AC–PC re-orientation of all anatomical and EPI images; realignment of functional EPI images based on intracranial voxels to correct for slight head movement between scans; co-registration of functional EPI images to corresponding high-resolution anatomical image for each participant; stereotactic normalization to the standardized coordinate space of Talairach and Tournoux (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI average of 152 T1 brain scans) based on the high-resolution anatomical image; and spatial smoothing of the normalized EPI images with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 7.5 mm).  First, a voxel-by-voxel univariate multiple linear regression model at the participant level was employed to determine the extent to which each voxel’s activity correlated with the condition-dependent principal regressors, which consisted of stimulus onset times and duration convolved with a prototypical hemodynamic response function. The temporal global ﬂuctuation estimated as the mean intensity within brain region of each volume was removed through proportional scaling. The ﬁrst-order temporal derivative of the principal regressors, temporal global ﬂuctuation, realignment parameters, and scanning periods were incorporated as covariates of no interest. This ﬁrst level analysis resulted in a set of contrast images of condition-dependent eﬀects for each participant (including the eﬀect of each condition vs. rest and the eﬀects of between-condition comparisons), which were entered into second stage group-level analyses. These second level analyses included: (1) voxel-wise factorial repeated-measures ANOVA (previously reported in [11]); (2) block-level functional connectivity analysis through voxel-wise analysis of correlation with a functionally-deﬁned seed region (also previously reported in [11]); and (3) PCA (newly reported here).  The voxel-wise repeated-measures ANOVA focused on direct, between-group categorical comparison of females versus males using the Rotation (vs. Rest) contrast. The block-level functional  connectivity seed analysis identiﬁed brain regions that correlated with a single ‘‘seed’’ region of interest. This seed region was identiﬁed by assessing (in men and women separately) which brain regions correlated with mental rotation performance. In women, a region of dorsalmedial prefrontal cortex was most correlated with mental rotation performance. In men, a region of posterior insula (corresponding anatomically to parieto-insula vestibular cortex – PIVC) was most correlated with accurate mental rotation performance. Block-level activity in these seed regions was extracted and entered into separate multiple regression analyses for men and women to identify brain networks associated with accurate mental performance. See [11] these analyses.  for details of  For the second stage group-level PCA, three sets of PCA (within either female or male group and with all 25 participants) were carried out to examine the major spatial modes of each condition/contrast eﬀect in association with factors including education level, performance accuracy, perceived task diﬃculty level, reaction time, age and sex (the last factor was for PCA with all subjects only). For each condition/contrast, the normalized data matrix XN·M (N participants under consideration, by M voxels within the standardized brain space) of a condition-dependent eﬀect of interest (e.g. Rotate, or Rotate vs. Compare) was subject to singular value decomposition in the form of X NM ¼ U NN  SNN  V T  NM ;  where the N columns of unitary orthogonal VM·N are the resulting eigenimages (spatial modes or principal components) of the correlation matrix X T MN X NM (i.e., pair-wise/voxel-to-voxel functional connectivity matrix), SN·N is a diagonal matrix of decreasMN  X NM  V MN is a ing singular values (i.e., S2 diagonal matrix of decreasing eigenvalues) and the N columns of unitary orthogonal UN·N are the corresponding loading score vectors.

Results and discussion  3.1. Behavioral results  As reported in detail in [11], reaction times were longer and accuracy lower at higher angles of rotation, in accord with Shepard and Metzler classic ﬁndings [2], conﬁrming that subjects were appropriately engaged in the task. There were no signiﬁcant sex diﬀerences in accuracy or reaction time. Women averaged 75% correct (std 16), men 83% correct (std 17). Similar levels of behavioral performance among males and females – not unexpected given the low sample size typical of this and most functional neuroimaging studies – allow interpretation of imaging results without the confound of diﬀerential performance. The absence of behavioral sex diﬀerences can be ascribed with greater conﬁdence to low statistical power, since prior extensive behavioral testing has shown the mental rotation task used in this study to be a valid measure of mental rotation abilities which does in fact give rise to the expected male performance advantage when applied to a larger population [16]. Thus, our ﬁnding of non-signiﬁcant behavioral sex diﬀerences during fMRI scanning does not call into question the validity of the task or subjects’ engagement in the task, but instead lends support to the idea that signiﬁcant sex differences in patterns of neural activity may be due to basic diﬀerences in processing, and not solely to diﬀerential performance.  3.2. Categorical analyses (voxel-wise factorial repeated-measures ANOVA): Rotate vs. Control condition; Men and Women combined  As reported in detail in [11] and shown in Fig. 2, standard between-sex and between-condition contrast analyses showed that during mental rotation (as compared to the control condition),  Fig. 2.

Shown at z = 60 mm, voxel-wise p < 0.005.  both men and women activated bilateral prefrontal cortices, bilateral parietal (inferior and superior lobules), bilateral temporal– in agreement occipital regions and visual association cortices, with multiple prior mental rotation studies (e.g. [17,18]). See [11] for detailed results, including regions de-activated during mental rotation, which in general corresponded to a ‘‘default’’ brain network more active during rest than during most tasks [19,20].  3.3. Categorical analyses: Rotate (vs. Rest); Women vs. Men  As shown in Fig. 3a, between-sex comparisons during mental rotation revealed greater activity in women in bilateral dorsalmedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC; x =  9, y = 27, z = 51; x = 15, y = 30, z = 54) – a region strongly implicated in top-down, eﬀortful cognitive processing [21] including decision-making [22] and spatial working memory [23]. Greater frontal activity in women is in broad accord with the majority of prior functional neuroimaging studies of mental rotation demonstrating sex diﬀerences [3,6,24].  3.4. Univariate block-level ‘‘seed’’ connectivity analyses  As also reported in [11], in women, accurate mental rotation performance was signiﬁcantly correlated inversely with brain activity in left (extending to right) middle frontal gyrus (MFG). In men, the only brain region signiﬁcantly correlated with accurate performance was left posterior insula bordering on claustrum, with decreased activity associated with better performance. This posterior insula/claustrum region appears to correspond anatomically to the cortical projections of the vestibular system, referred to as parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) [25,26] and further discussed below and in [11]. The two brain regions found to be most associated with accurate performance in women and men (left MFG and left PIVC, respectively) were used as ‘‘seed’’ voxels in separate univariate functional connectivity analyses to identify brain networks diﬀerentially associated with accurate mental rotation performance in men and women. Brain regions identiﬁed as correlating positively with left MFG activity during mental rotation were similar for both men and women, and included bilateral frontal regions, bilateral angular gyri, bilateral temporal association cortices, and most prominently, bilateral posterior cingulate. In general, these regions appear to correspond to a ‘‘default’’ brain network previously shown to be active when subjects are not engaged in any particular task [19,20].  In contrast to similar MFG-correlated networks in men and women, PIVC-correlated networks diﬀered markedly by sex. In men, left PIVC inversely-correlated activity was extensive, and consisted of a large-scale network of visuospatial-related brain regions including most prominently bilateral parieto-occipital association cortex (precuneus, BA 7), as well as right temporal– occipital regions, bilateral early/primary visual cortices, and bilateral posterior parahippocampal gyrus, extending on the left to the fusiform gyrus, as shown in Fig. 4. In women, inverse correlation with activity in left PIVC was relatively sparse. Automatic evocation by men to a greater extent than women of this visual/vestibular network during mental rotation may represent an eﬀective, unconscious, ‘‘bottom-up’’ neural strategy which could reasonably account for men’s traditional visuospatial performance advantage.  T. Butler et al. / Clinical Neuroscience Research 6 (2007) 391–398  395  Fig. 3. Patterns of sex diﬀerence during mental rotation detected using between-group categorical analysis (A) and PCA (B). Categorical analysis compared Women vs. Men for the rotation vs. rest contrast. PCA was performed on the rotation vs. rest contrast with Principal Component 2 (PC2) correlating with sex. Both methods demonstrate greater dorsalmedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) activation in woman. However, PCA shows that activity in DMPFC is also associated with activity in bilateral parietal regions, and that this pattern of activity is more strongly expressed in women. Both maps show axial slice at z = 48 mm and are displayed at voxel-wise p < 0.01.  3.5. PCA using Rotation (vs. Rest) contrast images  Using Rotation contrast images (corresponding to brain areas activated during rotation as compared to rest, with one contrast image per subject), the ﬁrst principal component (PC1) was found to account for 53.11% of total variance, indicating that the mental rotation activation task induced a robust, consistent patterns of brain activity. As shown in Fig. 5a, PC1 consisted of activation of bilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA 6), bilateral/midline superior frontal gyrus, bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobules and bilateral occipital and occipitotemporal regions, with de-activation in precuneus, bilateral rostral medial frontal gyri (BA 10), bilateral posterior insula (possibly corresponding to parieto-insular vestibular cortex; PIVC), and bilateral inferior parietal lobule (more posterior to the area of activation). This pattern of results matches closely those obtained by us, as shown in Fig. 2, using standard categorical analyses, and is in accord with multiple other studies of mental rotation [17,18]. PC1 can be considered the core mental rotation brain network.  3.6. PCA using Rotation vs. Control contrast images  When the Rotation vs. Control (0° rotation) contrast images were entered into PCA, PC1 turned out to be similar but not identical, as shown in Fig. 5b. The identiﬁed network still included bilateral prefrontal, frontal and parietal regions, but with much less occipital activation, as would be expected, since level of visual stimulation was designed to be identical between activation and control condition, and was therefore subtracted out by the contrast. More interestingly, PC1 using the contrast images included more prominent bilateral insula de-activation. Given that we consider this region to be a key node in a visual–vestibular network involved in the mental rotation process [11], that would not be expected to be involved during the control comparison condition,  this ﬁnding indicates that subtracting out control activity may provide somewhat greater sensitivity for detecting speciﬁc parts of the network. However, entering between-condition contrast images into PCA must be done with caution, since the images upon which analysis is performed no longer correspond to the full set of brain regions active during a task, but to a subtraction image from which certain networks or parts of networks have been removed. It should also be noted that even entering a contrast image corresponding to the activation task versus resting constitutes a between-condition contrast insofar as the ‘‘resting state’’ is increasingly recognized to consist of a distinct pattern of activity corresponding to a default network [19,20]. Using an activation task to probe brain regions/circuits of interest serves as a ﬁlter through which brain networks speciﬁcally activated by the task (but not other aspects of the network) can be viewed.  3.7. PC1 correlation with education  PC1 correlated signiﬁcantly with the level of education (r = 0.43, p = 0.017 for rotation; r = 0.64, p = .0003 for the rotation vs. control (0°) condition, but not with any other factors. What this means is that a subject’s level of education (which ranged from 12 to 20 years) was associated with the degree to which he or she expressed the core mental-rotation-associated neural pattern. This ﬁnding will require replication using a prospective study design, but may relate to a subject’s willingness and ability to follow instructions and comply with task demands – attributes likely associated with education. Level of aptitude for mental rotation, while also shown to be associated with aspects of education [27–29] is less likely to account for this ﬁnding, because PC1 did not correlate with either mental rotation performance (r = 0.12, (r = 0.33, p > 0.05). This ﬁnding is an example of PCA’s ability to separate these factors and association.  p > 0.2) or perceived task diﬃculty  396  T.

Network of brain regions shown inverse correlation with activity in left parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC; x =  33 mm, y =  3 mm, z = 9 mm) during mental rotation in men (green) and women (red). PIVC is the region mostly correlated with performance accuracy in men. Results are displayed at a threshold of p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons over the whole brain. Note the extensive activation of parietal–occipital cortices in men, but not women. Mens’ greater use of this visual–vestibular network during mental rotation may explain their traditional performance advantage for this task. This ﬁgure was taken from [11] and used with publisher’s permission.  3.8. PC2 correlation with sex  frontal gyri  PC2, accounting for 5.74% of total variance, was signiﬁcantly diﬀerentiated according to sex (r = 0.36; p = 0.039). PC2 consisted of a pattern of activation (corresponding to greater activity in women) in bilateral/midline superior frontal gyrus/dorsalmedial prefrontal gyrus (DMPFG), bilateral right > left middle/inferior (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC), bilateral superior parietal lobule (BA 7), and left lateral occipital cortex, with de-activation (corresponding to greater activity in men) of posterior cingulate and bilateral postcentral gyri, as shown in Fig. 3b. These results, obtained in a data-driven fashion, match closely those obtained using an investigator-deﬁned categorical approach of comparing directly men and women. In particular, greater DMPFC and left lateral occipital activation in women, and greater precuneus and postcentral gyri activation in men, were detected using both approaches. The similarity of results obtained using both methods are apparent in Fig. 3. These sex diﬀerences are broadly consistent with women taking a ‘‘top down’’ approach to mental rotation, relying more upon highorder frontal regions such as DMPFC. Diﬀerences between the categorical and PCA approach include greater DLPFC activation detected using PCA. Given the role of DLPFC in eﬀortful cognitive processing and working memory, it is likely that PCA was more sensitive in detecting reliance of women upon this region. PCA also revealed bilateral superior parietal activation, which has also been reported to be greater in women than in men [7], but was not signiﬁcant using a categorical approach. The fact that PC2 – the sex-divergent pattern of activity – accounted for 5.74% of total variance, provides a framework for understanding the magnitude of neural sex diﬀerences during mental rotation.  3.9. PCA in men and women separately  While the above described PCA included both male and female subjects, and was therefore able to identify a sex-divergent pattern of activity in a data-driven manner, PCA was also examined in men and women separately. For both men and women, PC1 –  T. Butler et al. / Clinical Neuroscience Research 6 (2007) 391–398  397  Fig. 5. Principal Component 1 (PC1) – the core mental rotation network – obtained using Rotation (vs. rest) contrast images (A) and Rotation vs. Control Condition contrast images (B). Both identiﬁed networks include bilateral prefrontal, frontal and parietal regions. Less occipital activation in the rotation vs. control contrast is expected, since level of visual stimulation was designed to be identical between both conditions, and was therefore subtracted out by the contrast. See text for discussion of other diﬀerences. Maps are displayed at both z = 60 mm and z = 0 mm and thresholded at p < 0.01, uncorrected.  which consisted predominantly of bilateral cortical activation – was very similar to PC1 identiﬁed on the mixed sex group (shown in Fig. 5), as would be expected since this principal component did not correlate with sex (r =  0.0514, p = 0.6). Interestingly, PC1 in men alone correlated with perceived task diﬃculty (r = 0.62, p = 0.01), while in women alone, PC1 correlated with education (r = 0.62, p = 0.01) as well as with performance accuracy (at a trend level, r = 0.43, p = 0.07). While speculative, it may be considered that these ﬁndings ﬁt with the idea that men can perform mental rotation in a more automatic, less eﬀortful manner, with less cortical activation and greater reliance upon subcortical structures known to be involved in skill and habit learning [30] Nonautomatic, more eﬀortful mental rotation performance might be associated with greater cortical activation, as demonstrated by  the correlation of PC1 with task diﬃculty. Continued investigation and validation of these sex-speciﬁc brain networks involved in visuospatial processing can provide a method for assessing the contribution of factors such as sex hormones, psychosocial factors and genetics to network expression.  In sum, these diﬀerent approaches to the analysis of an fMRI activation paradigm provide similar, complementary results. The data-driven PCA approach provides a helpful conﬁrmatory function in this context. A key beneﬁt of PCA is the ability to truly characterize interactions among brain regions during task performance, and to quantify patterns of covariance. These data-driven patterns can be correlated with other variables or measures post hoc. PCA may provide a foundation for future use in situations where group membership is not known, and can possibly be deter 398  T. Butler et al. / Clinical Neuroscience Research 6 (2007) 391–398  mined using these techniques. By quantifying, in a data-driven fashion, the contribution of factors such as sex and education to patterns of brain activity, our PCA ﬁndings put the magnitude of neural sex diﬀerences during mental rotation into perspective, conﬁrming the commonsense notion that, as humans, men and women are more alike than they are diﬀerent, with between-individual variability (such as level of education, which, importantly, is modiﬁable) generally outweighing between-sex variability. This work exempliﬁes the role that multivariate analysis such as PCA can play in providing true network-based functional information, as well as quantifying the contribution of a given network’s activity within and across diﬀerent populations.

These negative psychiatric outcomes may reﬂect the detrimental impact of substance abuse on neural systems mediating emotion processing and executive attention. However, work indicative of this has mostly been conducted either in animal models or adults with Alcohol and/or Cannabis Use Disorder (AUD/CUD). Little work has been conducted in adolescent patients. In this study, we used the Aﬀective Stroop task to examine the relationship in 82 adolescents between AUD and/or CUD symptom severity and the functional integrity of neural systems mediating emotional processing and executive attention. We found that AUD symptom severity was positively related to amygdala responsiveness to emotional stimuli and negatively related to responsiveness within regions implicated in executive attention and response control (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus) as a function of task performance. In contrast, CUD symptom severity was unrelated to amygdala responsiveness but positively related to responsiveness within regions including precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule as a function of task performance. These data suggest diﬀerential impacts of alcohol and cannabis abuse on the adolescent brain.  1. Introduction  Two of the most commonly abused substances by adolescents in the US are alcohol and cannabis (Miech et al., 2016). Notably, epidemiological evidence suggests that adolescent alcohol users are twice as likely to develop Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) while adolescent cannabis users are over three times as likely to develop Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) by age 26 than non-users (Winters and Lee, 2008). Furthermore, adolescents who initiate substance use face a more severe disease course and a greater likelihood of relapse (Babor et al., 1992). This may reﬂect the deleterious neurodevelopmental impact of substance abuse on the adolescent brain (Filbey et al., 2015; Squeglia et al., 2015), which is undergoing critical changes at this time (Goddings et al., 2014).  One neuro-circuitry undergoing development during adolescence that  may be disrupted by substance abuse is the neuro-circuitry mediating emotional processing (Koob and Volkow, 2016). Animal work suggests that substance dependence leads to decreased striatal response to reward and increased amygdala responsiveness to stress (Koob and Volkow, 2016). In line with this, there have been reports of increased amygdala responses to negative images in alcohol dependent adults relative to controls (Gilman and Hommer, 2008), and in undergraduate students who also demonstrated relatively low ventral striatal responsiveness to reward (Nikolova et al., 2016). Additionally, there has been at least one report of increased amygdala responsiveness to angry relative to neutral faces in adolescents with mild cannabis use histories (group average: < 5 times lifetime usage) (Spechler et al., 2015). However, other work has reported reduced amygdala responses to emotional relative to neutral faces in alcohol dependent adults (O'Daly et al., 2012) and in adult heavy cannabis smokers relative to healthy control adults (Gruber et al., 2010). In short, the human fMRI  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Center for Neurobehavioral Research, Boys Town National Research Hospital, 14100 Crawford Street, Boys Town, NE 68010, United States.

NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  literature is somewhat inconsistent and focused on studies with adult participants.  A second putative neuro-circuitry disrupted by substance abuse is that mediating behavioral inhibition (Feldstein Ewing et al., 2014; Silveri et al., 2016; Spear, 2016); i.e., anterior cingulate/dorsomedial prefrontal cortices (ACC/dmPFC) and anterior insular cortex/inferior frontal gyrus (aIC/iFG; Criaud and Boulinguez, 2013). Moreover, substance abuse may also disrupt regions showing dense projections with ACC/dmPFC (i.e. dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and parietal cortices) which are critical for executive attention (Desimone and Duncan, 1995; Squire et al., 2013). Neuroimaging work has revealed that, relative to controls, undergraduate students and adults with heavy alcohol use histories show reduced ACC responses during NoGo trials relative to baseline (Ahmadi et al., 2013; Claus et al., 2013) and reduced dlPFC responses during successful, relative to unsuccessful, Stop trials during a Stop Signal Task (Li et al., 2009). Furthermore, ACC functional connectivity has been identiﬁed as a predictor of relapse in adults aged 18–50 with AUD (Zakiniaeiz et al., 2017). The literature in adolescents aged 18 and younger has been more mixed. One study reported an inverse relationship between prior alcohol consumption and aIC responses to incongruent relative to congruent trials during a Stroop task (Thayer et al., 2015). Another study which tracked youths from early to late adolescence reported that adolescents (ages 11–17) who later transitioned into heavy drinking showed decreased activity within middle frontal and parietal cortices in NoGo relative to Go trials prior to the onset of heavy drinking compared to controls who did not transition into heavy drinking (Norman et al., 2011; Wetherill et al., 2014). At a three-year follow-up after the onset of heavy drinking (at ages 14–21), adolescents who did transition to heavy drinking showed increased BOLD responses in these contrasts and brain regions relative to their baseline scans. However, participants who did not transition to heavy drinking showed decreased BOLD responses in these contrasts and brain regions relative to their baseline scans (Wetherill et al., 2014).  The empirical literature suggests a rather diﬀerent relationship between cannabis usage and brain regions implicated in behavioral inhibition or executive attention, speciﬁcally increased (potentially compensatory) recruitment of these regions. In a Stroop task, adults with histories of heavy cannabis use showed increased ACC and dlPFC activity during interference trials relative to controls (Gruber and Yurgelun-Todd, 2005). Additionally, in a Multi-Source Interference Task, adults with histories of chronic cannabis smoking showed increased ACC recruitment during interference trials relative to control trials compared to healthy control subjects (Gruber et al., 2013). Furthermore, Filbey and Yezhuvath (2013) showed that cannabis-dependent adults showed greater connectivity between right frontal cortex and the substantia nigra/subthalamic nucleus network during successful inhibition on a Stop Signal task compared to non-dependent cannabis using adults. In a sample of adolescents, marijuana users showed increased recruitment of executive attention regions during NoGo trials relative to baseline in a Go-NoGo task (Tapert et al., 2008). Dysfunction in executive attention neuro-circuitry may be related to increased amygdala responsiveness to threat in patients with substance abuse. Executive attention neuro-circuitry involves the dlPFC and parietal cortices and allows the priming of task-relevant representations at the expense of irrelevant ones (Desimone and Duncan, 1995). This increased priming of task-relevant stimuli inhibits the representation of emotional distractors and results in reduced amygdala responses to these distractors (Blair et al., 2007). Executive attention can be recruited explicitly within cognitive reappraisal emotion regulation paradigms (Ochsner and Gross, 2005) but also implicitly through emotion distraction paradigms (Erthal et al., 2005). Both executive attention and emotional responsiveness systems are implicated in exteroception, or processing self-relevant external stimuli, and is thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of substance abuse (DeWitt et al., 2015). If alcohol and/or cannabis abuse compromise task-relevant executive attention,  then representation of external  stimuli should be impaired, resulting in compromised emotion regulation and increased emotional responsiveness. Alternatively, alcohol and/or cannabis abuse may compromise neural systems underlying exteroception relatively independently, resulting in reduced representation of task-relevant stimuli regardless of emotional stimuli and/or increased emotional responsiveness regardless of task demands. In the current study, we implemented an emotion distraction task, the Aﬀective Stroop task (aST; Blair et al., 2007) in adolescents showing varying levels of AUD and CUD symptomatology. In the aST, participants are instructed to determine the quantity of numbers displayed on the screen that are temporally bracketed by either emotional or neutral distracters. Work with healthy adolescents (Hwang et al., 2014) and adults (Blair et al., 2007) reveals that task performance is associated with decreased amygdala responsiveness to emotional distracters and increased recruitment of regions mediating behavioral inhibition (ACC, dmPFC, aIC, and iFG) and executive attention (dlPFC and parietal cortices) to task-relevant stimuli. The aST has been extensively used in work with both adolescent and adult clinical populations (Blair et al., 2013, 2012; Hwang et al., 2016, 2015; White et al., 2014). Speciﬁcally, adults with GAD, SAD, and PTSD show compromised recruitment of ACC and/or parietal cortices during task relative to view trials (Blair et al., 2013, 2012) while adolescents with ADHD, show reduced dmPFC activity during incongruent trials relative to typically developing (TD) adolescents (Hwang et al., 2015). Furthermore, in adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs), there is decreased recruitment of aIC in incongruent relative to view trials and the degree to which this is compromised relates to impulsivity symptoms within this sample (Hwang et al., 2016). In addition, adolescents with DBDs and high levels of callous-unemotional traits showed reduced vmPFC and amygdala responsiveness to negatively valenced stimuli (Hwang et al., 2016). In short, the aST has been successfully used to show dysfunction in emotion processing, behavioral inhibition, and executive attention neuro-circuitries in adult and adolescent clinical populations.  We hypothesized that: (i) participants with high levels of AUD and CUD symptoms would show increased recruitment of the region implicated in emotional responding to both positively and negatively valenced stimuli (amygdala); and (ii) participants with at least high levels of AUD symptomatology would show reduced recruitment of regions implicated in behavioral inhibition (dmPFC/ACC and/or aIC/ iFG) and/or executive (dlPFC and/or parietal cortices) to task relative to view trials.  2. Materials and methods  2.1. Participants  Study participants included 96 youths aged 14–18 years from both a residential treatment facility and the community. 14 participants were excluded due to excessive movement (> 10% volumes censored at > 1 mm motion across adjacent volumes) or low accuracy on the task (< 60% accuracy; average AUDIT of excluded participants = 4.2, average CUDIT of excluded participants = 5.0). This resulted in a ﬁnal sample of 82 youths (47 youths from the residential treatment facility and 35 from the community); average age = 16.1 (SD = 1.32), IQ = 100.6 (SD = 10.13) and 51 male. Clinical characterization was done through psychiatric interviews by licensed and board-certiﬁed psychiatrists with the participants and their parents. Youths with signiﬁcant substance abuse histories were residents of the residential treatment facility and were abstinent for at least four weeks prior to scanning.  49 youths endorsed having used, and 33 youths denied having used, alcohol and/or cannabis on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identiﬁcation Test (AUDIT) and the Cannabis Use Disorder Identiﬁcation Test (CUDIT), respectively (Adamson et al., 2010; Fairlie et al., 2006; Saunders et al., 1993). The range of AUDIT scores and CUDIT scores was 0–22 (M = 2.9; SD = 4.65) and 0–32 (M = 7.0; SD = 8.96), respectively. AUDIT scores, but not CUDIT scores, were signiﬁcantly related with age  783  J.

[AUDIT: r = 0.26, p = 0.02; CUDIT: r = 0.19, ns] while neither AUDIT nor CUDIT scores were signiﬁcantly related to IQ [AUDIT: r = −0.118, ns; CUDIT: r = −0.159, ns]. There were no diﬀerences in AUDIT or CUDIT scores between males and females [AUDIT: t(80) = −0.76, ns; CUDIT: t(80) = 1.09, ns].  Of the youths endorsing alcohol and/or cannabis use during their lifetimes, 14 youths showed subclinical levels of alcohol and/or cannabis use while 35 met the clinical cutoﬀs on the AUDIT and/or CUDIT suggestive of adolescent AUD (AUDIT score ≥ 4) or CUD (CUDIT score ≥ 8), respectively (Adamson et al., 2010; Fairlie et al., 2006). 21 participants had an AUDIT score ≥ 4 and 29 participants had a CUDIT score ≥ 8. In line with previous work indicating the high comorbidity of AUD and CUD (Mason et al., 2013; Moss et al., 2014), 15 participants had both an AUDIT score ≥ 4 and CUDIT score ≥ 8.  Exclusion criteria included pervasive developmental disorder, Tourette's syndrome, lifetime history of psychosis, neurological disorder, head trauma, and non-psychiatric medical illnesses requiring medications that may have psychotropic eﬀects (e.g. beta-blockers, steroids), and IQ < 75. The Institutional Review Board at Boys Town National Research Hospital approved the study procedures and informed assent/consent was obtained from all participants and their parents or legal guardians.  2.2. Measures  2.2.1. Aﬀective Stroop task (aST)  An adapted version of the Aﬀective Stroop task (Blair et al., 2007)  was administered during fMRI scanning (see Fig. 1). The emotional stimuli consisted of 16 negative, 16 neutral, and 16 positive pictures selected from the International Aﬀective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 1988). The mean valence and arousal values on a 9-point scale, respectively, were 3.2 (SD = 0.71) and 1.7 (SD = 0.28) for negative images; 4.9 (SD = 0.30) and 1.1 (SD = 0.22) for neutral images; and 7.4 (SD = 0.47) and 1.61 (SD = 0.31) for positive images. The individual cognitive task stimuli consisted of displays of numbers and the cognitive task involved deciding how many numbers were displayed in each display (see Fig. 1 for example stimuli). Speciﬁcally, subjects pressed button 3, 4, 5, or 6 to indicate whether there were 3, 4, 5, or 6 numbers in the display.  Each trial began with a ﬁxation point presented in the middle of the screen. For the number trials, the ﬁxation point was replaced by the ﬁrst picture stimuli presented for 400 ms, followed by the numerical display presented for 400 ms, followed by the second picture display presented for 400 ms, followed by a blank stimulus for 1300 (see Fig. 1). On incongruent trials, the Arabic numeral distracter information was inconsistent with the numerosity information (e.g., four 3s; Fig. 1A). On congruent trials, the Arabic numeral distracter information was consistent with the numerosity information; (e.g., three 3s; Fig. 1B). For view trials, there was no numerical display; the numerical display was replaced by a ﬁxation point (see Fig. 1C). Participants completed two identical runs of the task. In each run, each subject was presented with 16 trials of each of the 9 emotion-by-task conditions. This resulted in 288 total trials. In addition, 40 ﬁxation points (staying on the screen for the duration of a condition trial 2500 ms) were  784  J. Aloi et al.  Table 1 Clinical and demographic characteristics.

Thus, overall each subject was presented with 32 trials of each of the 9 emotion-by-task conditions resulting in 288 total trials.  2.2.2. Substance use disorder assessments  Youths completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identiﬁcation Test (AUDIT) and Cannabis Use Disorder Identiﬁcation Test (CUDIT). These scales assess overall alcohol/cannabis consumption over the past year as well as symptoms of alcohol/cannabis abuse and dependence. These scales show high validity, as elevated scores on these scales indicate a high probability of a AUD and/or CUD diagnosis (Adamson et al., 2010; Fairlie et al., 2006; Saunders et al., 1993). Smoking status was determined using the Monitoring the Future Survey (Miech et al., 2016). As can be seen in Table 1, participants meeting clinical cut-oﬀs on the AUDIT/CUDIT endorsed regular past smoking while sub-clinical levels of AUDIT/CUDIT symptomatology were associated with rare past usage. Most participants with no AUDIT/CUDIT symptomatology endorsed no prior smoking history.  2.2.3. Psychiatric symptomatology assessments  In order to provide more details on psychiatric co-morbidities, levels of externalizing, anxiety, and depressive symptomatology were assessed. The externalizing problems subscale of the parent-report version of the Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess externalizing behaviors (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001). The self-report version of the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARED) was used to assess levels of anxiety symptoms (Birmaher et al., 1997). The self-report version of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) was used to assess levels of depressive symptoms (Angold et al., 1995).  NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  2.3. Scanning parameters  Whole-brain blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data were acquired using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Skyra Magnetic Resonance Scanner. A total of 384 functional images were taken, divided over two runs, with a T2* weighted gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (repetition time = 2500 ms; echo time = 27 ms, 94 × 94 matrix; 90° ﬂip angle; 240 mm ﬁeld of view). Whole-brain coverage was obtained with 43 axial slices (thickness, 2.5 mm; voxel size 2.6 × 2.6 × 2.5 mm3). In the same session, a high-resolution T1 anatomical scan (MP-RAGE, repetition time = 2200 ms, echo time = 2.48 ms; 230 mm ﬁeld of view; 8° ﬂip angle; 256 × 208 matrix) was acquired in register with the EPI dataset. Whole-brain coverage was obtained with 176 axial slices (thickness, 1 mm; voxel size 0.9 × 0.9 × 1 mm3).  2.4. fMRI analysis: data preprocessing and individual level analysis  Functional MRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software (Cox, 1996). The ﬁrst four volumes in each scan were discarded. The anatomical scan for each participant was registered to the Talairach and Tournoux atlas (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) using the TT_N27 template and each participant's functional EPI data were registered to their Talairach anatomical scan in AFNI. Functional images were motion corrected and spatially smoothed with a 6-mm full width half maximum Gaussian kernel. The data then underwent time series normalization by dividing the signal intensity of a voxel at each time-point by the mean signal intensity of that voxel for each run and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the resultant regression coeﬃcients are representative of a percentage of signal change from the mean.  Afterward, regressors were generated by convolving the train of stimulus events with a gamma variate hemodynamic response function to account for the slow hemodynamic response. The ten regressors were: (i) positive images, incongruent numerosity; (ii) positive images, congruent numerosity; (iii) positive images, view; (iv) neutral images, incongruent numerosity; (v) neutral images, congruent numerosity; (vi) neutral images, view; (vii) negative images, incongruent numerosity; (viii) negative images, congruent numerosity; (ix) negative images, view; (x) missed/incorrect responses. GLM ﬁtting was performed with these ten regressors, six regressors modeling motion, and a regressor modeling a ﬁrst-order baseline drift function. This produced a β coefﬁcient and an associated t-statistic for each voxel and regressor.  2.5. fMRI analysis: group analysis  To reduce skewness and kurtosis, a Blom Transformation was applied to the participants' AUDIT and CUDIT scores. This is a normalization procedure which ranks orders, and then standardizes values within a dataset (Blom, 1958). The pre-transformation skewness values for AUDIT and CUDIT scores were 2.4 and 1.1, respectively. Posttransformation, the skewness values were 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. The pre-transformation kurtosis values for AUDIT and CUDIT scores were 6.4 and 0.3, respectively. Post-transformation, the kurtosis values were −0.4 and −0.6, respectively. The Blom-Transformed standardized AUDIT and CUDIT scores were used for all analyses. For the group-level analyses, a 3 (Emotion: Positive, Neutral, Negative) × 3 (Task Condition: Incongruent, Congruent, View) repeated measures ANCOVA with AUDIT and CUDIT scores as continuous covariates was performed on the BOLD data within a grey matter mask created in AFNI. Follow-up testing was performed within SPSS 22.0 and freely available online tools (Lee and Preacher, 2013). For signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-emotion interactions, Steiger Z-tests were used to compare the partial correlations between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses (controlling for CUDIT scores and AUDIT-by-CUDIT interactions) in the positive trials, neutral trials, and negative trials (Steiger, 1980). A similar procedure was used for any signiﬁcant CUDIT-by-emotion, AUDIT-by-task condition, and  785  J. Aloi et al.

For four-way interactions, a bootstrapping procedure using the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Preacher and Hayes, 2004) was used to examine how CUD symptomatology moderated the eﬀect of AUD symptomatology on BOLD response within each of the 9 emotion-by-task condition trial types. For these follow-up tests, the AUDIT-by-CUDIT interaction term was considered signiﬁcant at a threshold of p = 0.05, Bonferroni corrected. For each trial type that was identiﬁed as signiﬁcant, the Johnson-Neyman technique was used to investigate heterogeneity of the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses at diﬀerent levels of CUDIT scores (Kowalski et al., 1994). The Johnson-Neyman technique identiﬁes speciﬁc regions of interest within the distribution of CUDIT scores where the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses was signiﬁcant. The Johnson-Neyman technique was used to probe these interactions because it provides information regarding the nature of the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses across the entire distribution of CUDIT scores (Kowalski et al., 1994). To facilitate future metaanalytic work, eﬀect sizes (Partial η2) for all clusters are reported.  The AFNI 3dClustSim program, using the autocorrelation function (-acf), was used to establish a family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons for the amygdala ROI and whole-brain analysis (Cox et al., 2017). Spatial autocorrelation was estimated from residuals from the individual-level GLMs. Given our a priori hypotheses regarding the amygdala, regions of interest (ROIs) for left and right amygdala were speciﬁed as anatomically deﬁned masks (Eickhoﬀ-Zilles Architectonic Atlas 50% probability mask; Amunts et al., 2005). This yielded a threshold of 5 voxels at an initial threshold of p = 0.02 for the amygdala ROI. The whole-brain analysis yielded a threshold of 19 voxels at an initial threshold of p = 0.001. Post-hoc analyses were conducted on the percent signal change taken from all signiﬁcant voxels within each ROI and whole-brain functional masks generated by AFNI to examine signiﬁcant main eﬀects and interactions with planned follow-up testing within SPSS 22.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics For MacOSX, 2012).  3. Results  3.1. Clinical relationships  Correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relationships between AUD, CUD and psychiatric symptom levels dimensionally. These revealed positive correlations between AUDIT and CUDIT scores [r = 0.63, p < 0.001] and AUDIT scores and levels of externalizing problems (CBCL externalizing T-score), anxiety (SCARED total score) and depressive symptoms (MFQ) [r's = 0.27–0.33, p's < 0.05]. CUDIT scores were positively correlated with level of externalizing problems [r = 0.39, p = 0.001], and with level of anxiety symptoms and level of  786  depressive symptoms at trend levels [r's = 0.19–0.192, p's < 0.10]. Additionally, both AUDIT scores and CUDIT scores were positively related to level of smoking [r's = 0.65 and 0.70, respectively; p's < 0.001]. Importantly, there were no diﬀerential correlations between AUDIT and CUDIT scores and levels of externalizing problems, anxiety symptoms, or depressive symptoms [Steiger's Z's = 0.70–1.18, ns]. There were also no diﬀerential correlations between AUDIT and CUDIT scores and level of smoking [Steiger Z = 0.71, ns]. Ten participants had missing data for the CBCL, six had missing data for the SCARED, and two each had missing MFQ and smoking data. There were no diﬀerences in AUDIT scores or CUDIT scores between participants who were missing data on the CBCL, SCARED, MFQ, and/or smoking data and those who were not missing these data [t's < 1.36, ns]. See Tables 1 and 2 for more details.  3.2. Behavioral results  Two 3 (Emotion: Positive, Neutral, Negative) × 2 (Task Condition: Incongruent, Congruent) repeated measures ANCOVAs using the normalized Blom-Transformed AUDIT and CUDIT scores as continuous covariates were conducted on the aST accuracy and reaction time (RT) data. Accuracy on the aST ranged from 60% to 99%. There was a main eﬀect of task condition, [F(1,78) = 33.49, p < 0.001]; participants were less accurate on incongruent trials [M = 81.33%, SD = 14.61%] relative to congruent trials [M = 86.93%, SD = 10.04%]. The emotion main eﬀect, covariate-by-emotion interaction eﬀects, and covariate-bytask condition interaction eﬀects were not signiﬁcant.  With respect to RT, there was again a main eﬀect of task condition [F(1,78) = 167.33, p < 0.001]; participants responded slower on incongruent trials [M = 854.96, SD = 200.89] than congruent trials [M = 787.52, SD = 207.56]. The emotion main eﬀect, covariate-byemotion interaction eﬀects, and covariate-by-task condition interaction eﬀects were not signiﬁcant.  3.3. Movement data  Fourteen participants were excluded due to excessive motion or low accuracy on the task. Within the ﬁnal sample (N = 82), volumes were censored if there was > 1 mm motion across adjacent volumes. No participant in the ﬁnal sample for the current study had > 5% censored volumes. There were no relationships between either AUDIT scores or CUDIT scores and censored volumes, average motion per volume, or maximum displacement during scanning within the ﬁnal sample [r's = −0.10–0.20, ns].  J. Aloi et al.  3.4. fMRI results  The goal of the current study was to examine whether level of adolescent AUD and CUD symptomatology was related to dysfunction in brain regions associated with emotional responding and executive attention. We ran a 3 (Emotion: Positive, Neutral, Negative) by 3 (Task Condition: Incongruent, Congruent, View) repeated measures ANCOVA with the Blom-Transformed standardized AUDIT and CUDIT scores as continuous covariates on the BOLD response data. This revealed regions showing AUDIT-by-emotion, AUDIT-by-task condition, CUDIT-by-task condition and AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-emotion-by-task condition interactions. Regions showing main eﬀects of emotion and task and emotionby-tasks interaction are reported in the Supplemental material (Table S1). No regions showed signiﬁcant AUDIT main eﬀects, CUDIT main eﬀects, or AUDIT-by-CUDIT interactions. No regions showed signiﬁcant CUDIT-by-emotion, AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-emotion, AUDIT-by-CUDITby-task condition, AUDIT-by-emotion-by-task condition, or CUDIT-byemotion-by task condition interactions:  3.4.1. Amygdala ROI 3.4.1.1. AUDIT-by-emotion interaction. There was a signiﬁcant AUDITby-emotion interaction within the right amygdala (Fig. 2). With increasing AUDIT scores, there were increasing BOLD responses for positive relative to both neutral and negative stimuli [Steiger's Z's = 3.37 & 2.30, p < 0.001 & p < 0.05 respectively]. The ROI analysis revealed no signiﬁcant CUDIT-by-emotion interactions. The  NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-Emotion interaction within this cluster was not signiﬁcant, indicating that the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses was consistent across all CUDIT scores.  condition  interaction. 3.4.1.2. AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-emotion-by-task There was a four-way interaction in the left amygdala ROI (Fig. 2). Utilizing a bootstrapping procedure for the moderation analysis, it was found that there was a signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-CUDIT interaction eﬀect in negative view trials. Using the Johnson-Neyman technique, it was found that there was a negative relationship between AUDIT scores and activation low CUD there was a positive symptomatology (CUDIT = 0).

Whole-brain analysis 3.4.2.1. AUDIT-by-task condition interaction. There were signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-task condition interactions within regions including dlPFC, iFG, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), ACC, dmPFC, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; Fig. 3, Table 3). These regions overlapped with regions involved in the main eﬀect of task condition (Table S1). In all but one region of dlPFC, BOLD responses were greater to task relative to view trials. Additionally, within ACC and dmPFC, BOLD responses were also greater to incongruent relative to congruent trials. Within all of increased AUDIT scores were associated with decreased activation for incongruent relative to  these regions,  Fig. 2.

As can be seen in Fig. 3, these data reﬂected decreasing responses during incongruent trials as a function of increasing levels of AUD symptomatology. None of these clusters revealed a signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-Task Condition interaction, indicating that the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses were consistent across the entire distribution of CUDIT scores.  3.4.2.2. CUDIT-by-task condition interaction. There were signiﬁcant CUDIT-by-task condition interactions within regions including PCC, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule (iPL; Fig. 3, Table 3). These regions overlapped with regions involved in the main eﬀect of task condition (Table S1). Within all of these regions, BOLD responses were greater to task relative to view trials. In these regions, as CUDIT scores increased, there was increased activation for incongruent relative to congruent [Steiger's Z's = 2.84–3.98, p's < 0.005] and view trials [Steiger's Z's = 3.25–4.54, p's < 0.001]. As can be seen in Fig. 3, these data reﬂected both increasing responses during incongruent trials and decreasing responses during view trials as a function of increasing  levels of CUD symptomatology. None of these clusters revealed a signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-Task Condition interaction, indicating that the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses were consistent across the entire distribution of CUDIT scores.  condition  interaction. 3.4.2.3. AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-emotion-by-task There was a signiﬁcant four-way interaction eﬀect in the left iFG (Table 3). Notably, a bootstrapping procedure for the moderation analysis revealed a signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-CUDIT interaction eﬀect for negative view trials; AUDIT scores were negatively associated with activation at lower CUD symptom levels (CUDIT < 4) but positively associated at high CUD symptom levels (CUDIT > 27).  3.5. Potential confounds  Since age was related to AUDIT scores, the same analysis was repeated with age as a covariate (Table S2). In addition, calculation of Mahalanobis Distance for each participant revealed four multivariate outliers within the dataset. Therefore, the same analysis was repeated with these participants removed from the dataset (Table S3). Since there is evidence that males and females may be diﬀerentially aﬀected by alcohol and cannabis (Caldwell et al., 2005; Ketcherside et al., 2016;  788  J. Aloi et al.

Peters et al., 2015), the same analysis was repeated with gender was entered as a covariate (Table S4). To rule out the possibility that smoking may have inﬂuenced our results, the same analysis was repeated with participants who endorsed current smoking excluded (Table S5). To rule out the possibility that over-representation of 0 for AUDIT and CUDIT scores biased our results, we re-ran the analysis in only individuals who reported alcohol and/or cannabis use (Table S6). All of these analyses yielded similar results (see Supplementary results; Tables S2–S6).  4. Discussion  This study examined the relationships between AUD and CUD severity and dysfunction in emotional and executive attention neurocircuitry in adolescents. There were three main ﬁndings. First, increasing AUD, but not CUD, severity was associated with increasing amygdala responses to emotional relative to neutral stimuli. Second, increasing AUD severity was associated with decreasing levels of recruitment of regions implicated in executive attention for task relative to view trials. Third, increasing CUD severity was associated with increasing BOLD responses within PCC, precuneus, and iPL during task relative to view trials.  In line with our predictions, increasing severity of AUD symptomatology was associated with increasing amygdala responsiveness to emotional relative to neutral stimuli. This was seen for increasing AUD severity when responding to negative view trials if CUD symptomatology was high and for positive trials irrespective of task condition or level of CUD symptomatology. Previous work has suggested that chronic alcohol use leads to an increased stress response and hyperresponsiveness of the amygdala to threat stimuli (Koob and Volkow, 2016; Volkow et al., 2016). Thus, previous fMRI work has revealed that adults with alcohol dependence show increased amygdala responses to  threat (Gilman and Hommer, 2008) and that increased amygdala threat responsiveness is a risk factor for the development of alcohol abuse in college students – at least for those showing reward hyporesponsiveness (Nikolova et al., 2016). However, no previous work has investigated amygdala responsiveness to threat or (non-alcohol cue) positive stimuli in adolescents with alcohol abuse histories. The current data complements the earlier work by indicating threat hyper-responsiveness in adolescents as a function of AUD severity (at least for those with relatively high levels of CUD) and extends this earlier work by indicating elevated responsiveness to positive stimuli as a function of AUD severity also. The AUDIT-by-Emotion amygdala interaction is right lateralized. Lateralized amygdala ﬁndings are not uncommon in the literature though their interpretation remains speculative. A meta-analytic review of the data found evidence of a relative left amygdala lateralization for stimuli containing language and a relative right-lateralization for masked stimuli (Costafreda et al., 2008). This prompted the suggestion that the right amygdala might play a greater role in initial stimulus detection (Costafreda et al., 2008). On this basis, it could be suggested that adolescents with high levels of AUD symptoms are particularly responsive to the initial detection of emotional stimuli. However, this speculation goes considerably beyond the data.  It should be noted that severity of CUD symptomatology was not related to amygdala responsiveness to emotional stimuli. If this result replicates, models assuming that substance abuse generally leads to increased amygdala responsiveness (Koob and Volkow, 2016; Volkow et al., 2016) may need adjustment for adolescent substance use. The current data imply that correlates of AUD symptomatology diﬀer from those of CUD symptomatology in adolescents and that it is only alcohol abuse that leads to exaggerated amygdala responsiveness. The current ﬁndings are inconsistent with those of Spechler et al. (2015) who reported that adolescents with cannabis use histories show increased amygdala sensitivity to angry faces (Spechler et al., 2015). However,  789  J. Aloi et al.  NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  the Spechler et al. study involved adolescents who mostly reported very low levels of cannabis use (49/70 cannabis users endorsed only using marijuana once or twice in their lives). Moreover, the current study diﬀered from that of Spechler et al. with respect to psychiatric comorbidity. It could be argued that the psychiatric co-morbidity camouﬂaged any relationship between CUD symptomatology and amygdala responsiveness. However, it should be noted that this was not the case with respect to AUD symptomatology and amygdala responsiveness (yet psychiatric co-morbidity was comparably related to AUDIT scores as CUDIT scores).  In line with predictions, increasing severity of AUD symptomatology was associated with reduced recruitment of ACC/dmPFC and iFG for incongruent relative to both congruent and view trials. Both ACC/ dmPFC and iFG have been implicated in behavioral inhibition (Criaud and Boulinguez, 2013). Moreover, animal work has suggested that adolescent alcohol use is related to disrupted prefrontal cortex development and deﬁcits in response inhibition during adulthood (Gass et al., 2014; Irimia et al., 2015; Spear, 2016) while human neuro-psychological work has revealed impairment on measures of behavioral inhibition in adults with AUD (Czapla et al., 2016). The current data suggest that increasing levels of alcohol abuse are associated, even in adolescence, with compromised recruitments of regions implicated in behavioral inhibition (even though increasing AUDIT scores were not related to behavioral performance on the current task).  Additionally, the ACC/dmPFC contains dense projections to and from brain regions involved in executive attention, such as dlPFC and iPL (Desimone and Duncan, 1995). The current study showed that increasing AUD symptomatology was associated with decreasing recruitment of dlPFC and iPL for incongruent relative to congruent and congruent relative to view trials. This is consistent with prior work showing reduced activity in these brain regions in adults (Ahmadi et al., 2013; Claus et al., 2013; Li et al., 2009) and youths (Thayer et al., 2015) with alcohol use histories. Notably, though, within the context of the aST, activity in these brain regions is thought to reﬂect a putative role in priming task-relevant stimuli and consequent decreased representation of and responsiveness to emotional stimuli; i.e., emotional regulation (Blair et al., 2007). In short, the ﬁndings of a negative relationship between response inhibition and executive attention neurocircuitries and AUD symptoms, when combined with the positive relationship between amygdala responsiveness to emotional stimuli and AUD symptoms, might at least partly reﬂect the compromised functioning of this form of emotional regulation. It should be noted, however, that there was no evidence of any AUDIT-by-Emotion-by-Task Condition interactions; i.e., there were no indications of a failure to reduce emotional responsiveness as a function of AUD severity during negative task trials. Instead, AUD severity was associated with increased responsiveness across emotion conditions and might be particularly increased in negative view trials within IFG. As such, we assume that AUD severity is associated with increased emotional responsiveness that is independent of any failure in executive attention mediated emotional regulation.  Our third main ﬁnding was that increasing CUDIT scores were related to increasing activity within PCC, precuneus, and iPL during task relative to view trials. There have been suggestions that substance abuse, particularly cannabis abuse, may lead to increased prefrontal ineﬃciency; i.e., substance abuse may lead to compromised functioning of speciﬁc regions such that these regions need to be activated more strongly in order to produce successful task performance (Gruber et al., 2013; Luijten et al., 2014; Tapert et al., 2008). There have also been suggestions that patients with other psychiatric conditions also show indications of prefrontal ineﬃciency (Mitterschiﬀthaler et al., 2008; Wagner et al., 2006). In the current study, we saw clear indications of disruption in the functioning of frontal cortex particularly as a result of severity of AUD. However, increasing severity of AUD was associated with decreasing responsiveness within regions including dlPFC, iFG, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), ACC and dmPFC; i.e., increasing AUD  severity was associated with a decreased ability to recruit these regions rather than revealing increasing, compensatory activity. In contrast, increasing CUD symptom severity was associated with increasing responsiveness within PCC, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule in response to task trials; all regions implicated in responding to task trials. As such, these data might indicate a form of posterior attentional system ineﬃciency relating to CUD severity. Increasing CUD severity may have required participants to show stronger activation of these regions for successful task performance. While a compensatory account might explain the data of the current study, it is unclear why higher levels of CUD symptomatology would be associated with compensation while higher levels of AUD symptomatology would be associated with disrupted functioning (particularly when neither level of symptomatology related to behavioral performance). Alternatively, increased activity in the PCC and precuneus could reﬂect a failure of the default mode network to fully deactivate during task trials. This might reﬂect diﬀerences in concentration as a function of substance use and task diﬃculty (anonymous reviewer's suggestion). However, only these regions within the default mode network showed this eﬀect. Even at more lenient thresholds (initial p = 0.005, k = 10 voxels), no signiﬁcant clusters emerged within other regions implicated in the default mode network. It is unclear why diﬀerences in concentration would have selective eﬀects within the default mode network.  The results of this study must be viewed in light of ﬁve caveats. First, we did not conduct urine or Breathalyzer testing for substance use at the time of scanning. However, youths with signiﬁcant substance abuse histories were residents of a highly supervised residential treatment facility and had been abstinent for at least four weeks prior to scanning, mitigating this concern. Another signiﬁcant caveat is that this study was cross-sectional in nature. As such, it is not possible to be certain whether the observed relationships between levels of AUD and CUD symptomatology and brain function reﬂected impact of substance abuse on the developing brain or pre-existing risk factors for the emergence of symptomatology. Animal and longitudinal neuroimaging work has shown that alcohol and cannabis use alter neurodevelopment (Spear, 2016; Squeglia et al., 2015). However, dysfunction in behavioral inhibition/top-down attention systems is also predictive of later problematic substance use (Norman et al., 2011). One reason to believe that the current results are more reﬂective of the impact of AUD/CUD on the developing brain is that there were diﬀerential relationships between AUD and CUD symptomatology on brain function. It is not clear that there are pre-existing neural risk factors that place the individual at risk speciﬁcally for AUD rather than CUD. However, future longitudinal work would need to conﬁrm this suggestion. Third, the sample investigated here reﬂected clinical reality; i.e., there was a high degree of psychiatric co-morbidity in the participants that was particularly marked in those participants scoring high on the AUDIT/CUDIT. As such, the ﬁndings presented here might reﬂect psychopathology related to the co-morbid conditions rather than AUD/CUD symptomatology. It would be possible to test participants without co-morbid pathology. However, this would mean investigating a clinically atypical sample. Moreover, increasing substance abuse is hypothesized to compromise functions associated with the emergence of many of these psychiatric conditions (Koob and Volkow, 2016; Volkow et al., 2016). Critically though, and mitigating this concern, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the relationships of externalizing, anxiety, or depressive psychopathologies and AUD relative to CUD severity. As such, it is unclear how psychiatric comorbidities could account for the current data. Fifth, other indices of substance involvement were not available (e.g., age of ﬁrst use, cumulative exposure). Interestingly, using a Stop-Signal task, Filbey and Yezhuvath (2013) found that dependent, relative to non-dependent, marijuana using adults showed increased connectivity between right frontal cortex and substantia nigra/subthalamic nucleus and that the strength of this increased connectivity was modulated by both age of onset and quantity of cannabis use. In short, it is likely that these latter variables may modulate  790  J. Aloi et al.  NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  the strength of the ﬁndings here.  In summary, we found diﬀerential patterns of dysfunction associated with AUD and CUD symptomatologies. Elevated AUD symptomatology was associated with increased amygdala responses to positive relative to neutral stimuli and decreased responses in brain regions associated with behavioral inhibition and executive attention during incongruent relative to congruent trials. In contrast, elevated CUD symptomatology was associated with increased responses in the PCC, precuneus, and iPL for incongruent relative to congruent and view trials. These data suggest that correlates of AUD symptomatology diﬀer from those of CUD symptomatology.

However, self-related emotion processing in regular mindfulness practitioners is not extensively studied. In the current work we investigate differential neural and behavioral correlates of self-criticism and self-praise in 22 mid-to-long-term mindfulness meditators (LTM) compared to 22 matched meditation-naïve participants (MNP). In an fMRI experiment, participants were presented with blocks of individually selected positive (self-praise, SP), negative (self-critical, SC), negative but not-self-critical (NNSC), and general, neutral (NT) adjectives, and reported their affective state after the blocks. On the neural level, both SP and SC yielded more activation in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in LTM compared to MNP. Activation in this region correlated positively with non-react scores of the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and showed decreased functional connectivity to posterior midline and parietal regions in LTM compared to MNP during both self-related appraisals. Further, we found evidence for emotional reactivity in LTM on the neural level, particularly during SP. On the behavioral level, a mixed effects analysis revealed signiﬁcantly higher differences in affective ratings after blocks of SC compared to SP in MNP compared to LTM. Differences in DMPFC activation and affective ratings point towards increased awareness, potentially mindful regulation of SC and SP in LTM, while decreased connectivity to other regions of the default mode network could reﬂect a decreased self-focus in this group. As such, our results illustrate differences in self-related emotional processes in meditators and offer clinically relevant insights into mechanisms of mindful emotion regulation when facing self-criticism and self-praise.  © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  Self-related emotional processes are often disturbed in affective disorders. For example, depressed patients display a stronger and more negative self-focus (Greenberg and Pyszczynski, 1986; Joormann and Gotlib, 2010; Northoff, 2007) and increased rumination about negative aspects of the self (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008), while excessive self-critical thinking represents a vulnerability factor to depressive symptoms (Sherry et al., 2012). Despite the fundamental role of such self-related processes for mental health, research has only started to investigate  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics,  Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich, Switzerland.

At the same time, concepts like mindfulness and self-compassion have been increasingly incorporated into psychotherapy programs with the goal of facilitating healthier self-related processes (Baer et al., 2006; Keng et al., 2011). Mindfulness is often deﬁned as purposeful attention on momentary experiences in a non-judgemental way (Brown et al., 2007; Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Such a mindful state can be trained through meditation techniques and is believed to ultimately increase mindful behavior in everyday life (Kiken et al., 2015), for example in the facets: acting with awareness, non-judging and non-reacting to inner experiences, describing experiences, and observing (Baer et al., 2006). In relation to self-referential processes, a mindful present-moment focus can lead to a less attached and biased relation towards the self (Bishop et al., 2004) and less concerns with self-esteem (Brown et al., 2007). Moreover, self-related emotions might be faced less judgmentally  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.09.057 1053-8119/© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  J. Lutz et al. / NeuroImage 124 (2016) 958–967  959  and in a more accepting (Linehan, 1994), self-compassionate way (Neff, 2003; Thompson and Waltz, 2008). Thus, mindfulness and selfcompassion presumably lead to better emotion regulation skills with regards to self-related emotions, like dampening the negative effects of excessive self-critical thinking (Bishop et al., 2004; Hollis-Walker and Colosimo, 2011). Similarly, theoretical frameworks of mindfulness and neurobiological correlates propose changes in self-related functions as key mechanisms of salutary effects of mindfulness (Hölzel et al., 2011; Vago and Silbersweig, 2012).  Despite these proposed mechanisms and the clinical necessity to understand mindfulness related changes in self-related processes, research in this area is scarce, particularly regarding the neural level (Hölzel et al., 2011). One inﬂuential study on mindful selfreferential processing after a mindfulness course found a shift from a narrative self-focus, associated with cortical mid-line areas like the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) towards a more experiential body awareness (Farb et al., 2007). However, other studies report increases in mid-line areas related to mindfulness, as during mindful affect labeling (Creswell et al., 2007; Lieberman et al., 2007), mindful self-awareness (Herwig et al., 2010), and mindful perception of emotional stimuli in meditation-naïve participants (Lutz et al., 2014), and also in mindfulness meditators during mindful breathing (Hölzel et al., 2007).  Many studies on self-related processes contain a factor of decision making, i.e., participants judge whether a particular adjective describes themselves versus someone else (Northoff et al., 2006). Studying selfreferential processes and particularly self-related emotions in this way involves decision making aspects, which arguably occur to a much lesser degree in every-day self-appraisals. A recent study therefore investigated negative and positive self-appraisals in the form of individual inner talk (Brühl et al., 2014). Both conditions activated the DMPFC and dorso-lateral prefrontal (DLPFC) regions, while positive appraisals showed stronger activations in emotion generative regions (amygdala/ ventral striatum). This study, being close to every-day self-appraising thoughts, has high ecological validity, but the appraisals were not reported to the experimenters, thus the emotional involvement and relevance for the individual was not fully controlled. A study by Doerig et al. (2014), used self-critical stimuli that had been individually chosen and evaluated by each participant before a block-designed fMRI experiment. For self-critical stimuli, they reported neural activity in regions involved in emotion generation (anterior insula/hippocampus/amygdala formation), and bilateral frontal areas, presumably representing cognitive reappraisal of the evoked negative affect. They further reported activations in midline prefrontal areas for self-criticism. However, the study was limited to negative aspects of the self and no behavioral measure complemented the results.  The goal of the current study is to extend the clinically relevant but limited knowledge on mindful processing of self-related emotions. By extending Doerig et al. (2014)'s paradigm, we studied differential neural and behavioral correlates of individualized self-criticism (SC) and selfpraise (SP) in meditators with experience in Vipassana and closely related mindfulness practices (Lutz et al., 2008) compared to matched meditation-naïve controls. We focused on the Vipassana tradition, because it inﬂuenced current secular, clinical programs like MindfulnessBased Stress Reduction (MBSR) or Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) (Chiesa and Malinowski, 2011), and would potentially allow ﬁrst translational insights into altered self-related emotional processes through mindfulness training.  We hypothesized that 1) mid-to-long-term, regular mindfulness meditators (LTM) would show decreased habitual emotional reactivity to emotional, self-referential stimuli (SC and SP) both by decreased activity in emotion processing areas (extended amygdala/hippocampus region) and/or differential affective experience based on affective ratings after blocks of SC and SP. Similarly, we hypothesized 2) differential activity in prefrontal, self-referential and regulative areas, mainly DLPFC and DMPFC regions. Given the mixed ﬁndings for prefrontal areas, we  formulated this hypothesis non-directional. In addition, we explored neural correlations with particular aspects of trait mindfulness and differences in the functional connectivity between LTM and MNP.  Materials and methods  Subjects  Mid-to-long-term meditation practitioners (LTM) were recruited via local meditation groups and personal contacts. We required meditators to have more than one year of meditation experience with at least one year of regular Vipassana training, Vipassana retreat experience and a current meditation practice of at least one hour per week. We included 22 LTM (ages: 28–67, mean = 47, SD = 11.11, 10 female) with an average of 4861.50 lifetime practice hours in Vipassana or closely related open monitoring meditation techniques (Lutz et al., 2008) (range 281–18,325), and an average of 5971 h (range 506–18,805) when considering all meditation experience in this group (see Supplementary Material for full disclosure of LTM's mindfulness related experience and current practice).  LTM were matched with 22 nearly or completely meditation-naïve participants (MNP, ages: 29–64, mean = 45.45, SD = 10.94, 8 female), recruited via mailing lists and personal contacts. For matching statistics see Supplementary Material, Tables 4 and 5. MNP did not have a current or recent meditation practice (Supplementary Material, Table 3). Matching variables were age, gender, years of education and highest degree of education, general ﬁeld of occupation, and crystalline intelligence measured with Mehrfachwahl–Wortschatz–Intelligenztest (MWT-B, Lehrl, 1977).  All subjects were right-handed according to a handedness questionnaire (Annett, 1970) and without self-declared mental or neurological disorders. Further exclusion criteria were intake of psychotropic drugs, consumption of alcohol N 7 units/week, cigarettes N 10 units/day, or coffee (N10 cups/day) (see Supplementary Material, Table 6 for characteristics of the sample) and general contraindications against MRI examinations.  The study was approved by the ethics committee of the canton of Zurich and conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, 1992). All participants gave written informed consent and received a ﬁnancial compensation.  Experimental design  Questionnaires  Within a week before scanning, participants completed a set of ques tionnaires via an online investigation tool (Unipark, QuestBack).  Of particular interest for this study were trait mindfulness and selfcompassion. Mindfulness was assessed by the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et al. (2006), German version: Translation by Stroehle et al. (2010), KIMS-D-Items, 2010; Michalak et al. (2008)), with the facets: 1) observing and 2) describing sensations, perceptions, thoughts and feelings, 3) acting with awareness, 4) non-judging of, and 5) non-reactivity to inner experience. For self-compassion we administered the Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003, German version: Hupfeld and Rufﬁeux, 2011).  Further, we assessed the ability to identify and describe emotions with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS, Taylor et al. (1985), German version: Bach et al. (1996)), participant's sociodemographics, and experience with meditation and mindfulness related techniques.  Before scanning we administered the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule PANAS (Watson et al., 1988, German version: Krohne et al., 1996) to control for mood before scanning. After scanning, participants were asked in a structured interview about fatigue, general experience, pain, and discomfort during scanning.  960  J.

Schematic representation of one experimental block (SC condition) including times of presentation. Introduction depended on the respective condition.  Stimuli  Stimuli consisted of negative and positive personality-descriptive adjectives from the groups: appearance, social aspects, transient condition, talents, and dispositions and neutral words (Angleitner et al., 1990). The construction of 52 negative and neutral adjectives has been described in Doerig et al. (2014) and has been adopted for the additional list of 52 positive adjectives in the current experiment.  Within a week before scanning, participants selected via the online investigation tool all applicable, but a minimum of six self-critical (SC) adjectives, and six negative, but not self-relevant and thus not selfcritical (NNSC) adjectives from the list of negative adjectives. From the list of positive adjectives they selected all applicable, but a minimum of six self-praising (SP) adjectives. They further rated the adjectives regarding their subjective negative and positive valence (e.g., for SC-stimuli: “How negative do you perceive this trait?”) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “1: not at all” to “5: very much”.  For experimental stimulation, each adjective was supplemented with three synonymical adjectives from the same self-schema (compare Doerig et al., 2014).  Experiment  The experiment is based on Doerig et al. (2014)'s paradigm, extend ed with a self-praising condition and affective ratings.  The four conditions (SC, SP, NNSC, NT) and interjacent blocks of rest were presented in pseudo-randomized order. The introduction varied depending on the respective condition (self-criticism: “I am too”; selfpraise: “I am very”, negative non-self-referential: “I am not”; neutral: “it is”), followed by a ﬁxation cross. Subsequently, the four adjectives relating to a particular self-schema were presented, separated by ﬁxation crosses. A block lasted for 24 s. Subjects were instructed to focus on the meaning of the adjectives and any emotional response triggered by the adjectives. During the blocks of rest, subjects were asked to relax and do nothing in particular. LTM were speciﬁcally reminded to not meditate during the task or rest periods. After SC, SP, NNSC and NT blocks we acquired affective ratings and showed a ﬁxation cross (duration: 2 s + not used affective rating time). Each condition and rest periods were presented six times, resulting in 30 blocks and a total scan time of 15 min 15 s (see Fig. 1).  All negative, positive and neutral adjectives were presented only once. Two versions of the task were created, starting either with SC or SP. Subjects were randomly assigned to a version, each version was administered to half of the participants in each group. The task was programmed with Presentation™, Neurobehavioral Systems, USA and was presented via digital goggles (Resonance Technologies, Northridge, CA, USA). Subjects completed a trial run with meaningless adjectives before scanning.  Affective rating  As a manipulation check and insight into subjective experience during the experiment, we acquired affective ratings using a track ball (Current Designs, Philadelphia, USA) within a maximal time window of 6 s. To ensure participants would not mis-identify the affective rating as the main goal of the study, the instruction was to spontaneously answer the question “How do you feel in this moment?” but mainly  focus on the task with the adjectives. Ratings were given on a discrete scale with the Self-Assessment Mannikins as 5 anchoring points (Bradley and Lang, 1994). The discrete scale was coded in steps of 1, ranging from −250 (=mannikin very unhappy) to 250 (=mannikin very happy) with 0 as neutral.  Since ratings of an individual were correlated (ICC1 0.53), the nested data structure had to be taken into account. We formulated a linear mixed model to explain the relation between the dependent variable rating and the ﬁxed effects group and condition. Condition had SC as the reference level and further contained SP and the two non-selfreferential conditions NNSC and NT. The group factor had two levels (LTM, MNP). Our model contained a random effect for each subject.2 Since we hypothesized group differences in ratings after self-related emotional conditions but not after non-self related conditions we further included an interaction term for group and condition. Adding the group condition interaction signiﬁcantly improved model ﬁt (χ2(3) = 12.75, p = .005). Analysis of the mixed effects model was conducted using the lme4 library (Bates et al., 2014) in RStudio (Integrated development environment for R, RStudio (2012)). ICC was calculated using the multilevel package (Bliese, 2013), 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated using the bootstrap method.  Image acquisition  Scanning was performed at the University Hospital of Psychiatry (Zurich, Switzerland) using a 3-T Philips Intera whole-body MR unit equipped with a Philips SENSE head coil. With a sensitivity-encoded (Pruessmann et al., 1999) singleshot echo-planar sequence (SENSEsshEPI), 305 T2*-weighted echo planar image volumes with bloodoxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired (repetitiontime (TR)/echo-time (TE): 3000/30 ms, 36 transversal slices, whole brain, slice thickness: 4.0 mm, ﬁeld of view (FOV): 240 × 240 mm, matrix 80 × 80 voxel, resulting voxel size: 3 × 3 × 4 mm, orientation, SENSEfactor: 2.0). For each participant, a T1-weighted high-resolution image was acquired (TR/TE 6.73/3.1 ms; voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm, 145 slices, sagittal orientation, FOV: 230 × 225 × 225 mm).  Image pre-processing  Preprocessing and statistical analyses were conducted with the FSL software toolbox (Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, FMRIB, Smith et al., 2004). Preprocessing of the functional data included motion correction (MCFLIRT, Jenkinson et al., 2002), non-brain removal (BET, Smith, 2002), spatial smoothing (fullwidth half-maximum) with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm, grand-mean intensity normalization (FILM prewhitening, Woolrich et al., 2001) and highpass temporal ﬁltering with a cutoff period of 100 s. Pre-processed functional images were spatially registered to each subject's skullstripped high-resolution anatomical image using a boundary-based registration algorithm (BBR, Greve and Fischl, 2009). Normalization of the high resolution structural image to the standard space (Montreal Neurological  2 We determined the random effects structure of our model by comparing model ﬁts between a random intercept and a random intercept random slope for subject in group. The latter decreased the model ﬁt. Thus our ﬁnal model contained a random effect for subject.  J.

We applied the same statistical thresholds and FWE-correction as in the main analysis.  General linear model image analyses  Whole-brain analysis was conducted using the standard general linear model (GLM) approach, implemented in FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 6.00. First-level analysis comprised a ﬁxed-effect model for each subject, with box car functions for the four condition regressors (SC, SP, NNSC, NT), convolved with a canonical doublegamma hemodynamic response function including temporal derivatives. Extended movement regressors were entered as nuisance regressors (6 motion parameters including their derivatives (+6) and the squares of the parameters and derivatives (+12)). Affective rating periods (scale, modeled as boxcars with scale onset and the reaction time of the trial as duration) were entered as regressors of no interest. z (Gaussianised T) statistic images were calculated for our contrasts of interest SC N NT and SP N NT. For reasons explained in the behavioral results section, we did not analyze SC N NNSC.  Second-level group comparison of the ﬁrst-level results was carried out using a mixed-effects model implemented in FLAME (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects, Beckmann et al., 2003; Woolrich et al., 2004; Woolrich, 2008). The whole-brain contrasts were thresholded and FWE-corrected using clusters determined by z N 2.3 and a cluster significance threshold of p b 0.05 (based on Gaussian Random Field Theory) (Worsley, 2001).  Conjunction and correlation analysis  In a conjunction analysis between SP N NT and SC N NT we determined group difference in emotional self-referential processes independent of valence, using the conjunction null method based on the minimum statistic (Nichols et al., 2005). To further investigate group differences in our contrasts of interest, we computed Pearson correlations between facets of mindfulness that differed between groups and percent signal changes in the conjunction cluster. We further exploratively correlated percent signal change in the conjunction with total hours of practice adjusted for age (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007) and with practice intensity (Fox et al., 2012). However, given the heterogeneity of mindfulness related experience in our LTM sample we did not expect signiﬁcant correlations. Functional mean activation from the cluster were extracted for each participant and converted to percentage signal change as outlined by Mumford (2007).  Psycho-physiological interaction  Based on the result from the conjunction analysis, we explored differences in functional connectivity between groups during self-related emotional conditions (EMO). To this end, we collapsed SC and SP conditions into a single EMO regressor and conducted a psycho-physiological interaction analysis (PPI, Friston et al., 1997), in which the activation in the conjunction cluster (SEED) was compared to linearly detrended whole-brain fMRI activations (TARGET). In this GLM, we entered the fMRI time-series from the seed (extracted on the subject level, with the conjunction cluster transformed into the individual's functional space) as the physiological regressor (PHYS) and the EMO regressor. Other task regressors (NNSC, NT) and confound regressors (affective ratings periods, movement) were the same as in the standard GLM analysis. To test the PPI in the generalized, most sensitive form for block designs (Cisler et al., 2014), we included separate PPI terms for the EMO conditions (PHYS × EMO) and NT (PHYS × NT) and modeled the PPI effect of interest as the contrast between these regressors (PHYS × EMO N PHYS × NT), including the analogous negative relationship (PHYS × NT N PHYS × EMO). On the group level, we compared group differences in these functional connectivity patterns (PPI LTM versus PPI MNP). In order to disentangle this slightly complex double-regression and get at the underlying linear relations between  Results  Stimulus selection and questionnaire results  Groups did not differ in the number of self-chosen SC and SP stimuli, nor in the positive (for SP) or negative (for SC) evaluation of their stimuli before the scan (Supplementary Material, Table 8).  Comparing trait mindfulness, measured with the FFMQ, we found signiﬁcantly higher scores for LTM only for two of ﬁve factors, namely for observe (t(42) = −2.38, p = .02) and non-react (t(42) = −3.30, p = .002). Further, LTM showed higher self-compassion (SCS) and lower alexithymia (TAS) scores compared to MNP. Both differences showed a trend but were not signiﬁcant (Supplementary Material, Table 6). Using a fdr correction for the group comparisons in all 13 questionnaire-measures (Supplementary Material, Table 8), only nonreact was signiﬁcantly different. Both groups reported similar levels of positive and negative affect before scanning. After scanning, they indicated similar levels of comfort during the scan. There was a trend towards more reported tiredness during the scan in MNP (Supplementary Material, Table 9).  Affective rating  Behavioral analysis is based on 41 subjects (nLTM = 22, nMNP = 19)3, of which 34 did not miss any rating, 5 missed 1, and 2 missed 3 ratings. Mean mood rating during the scan across all subjects and conditions was 100.80, which represents an overall neutral to slightly positive mood on our Self-Assessment Mannikins scale.  In the linear mixed effect model, condition signiﬁcantly predicted affect. Compared to SC (b = 46.74, CI [15.75, 78.26]), all conditions lead to a signiﬁcantly higher affective rating (NT b = 84.91, CI [53.64, 119.03], NNSC b = 107.05, CI [75.04, 139.09], SP b = 139.69, CI [107.14, 170.99]), conﬁrming our experimental manipulation (see Fig. 2). Group did not signiﬁcantly predict overall affective ratings (b = 21.02, CI [−14.93, 70.76]). But the interaction between group and condition was positive for SP and NNSC compared to SC stimuli, indicating that the difference in affective ratings between self-related positive compared to self-related negative adjectives was signiﬁcantly smaller in LTM compared to MNP (SP b = −32.44, CI [−52.85, −11.75]). As NNSC were experienced signiﬁcantly less negative than SC, it could not serve as a negative, non-self referential control condition for SC and was not further analyzed on the neural level.  FMRI results  Subjects with more than 1.5 mm of head movement in one direction were excluded from fMRI analysis, resulting in analyzed 41 subjects (Table 1), which did not differ from our full sample in sociodemographics or matching. FMRI results showed the same regions when adding an additional regressor to control for gender (results not shown).  Self-relevant versus neutral stimuli  SC N NT led to increased activations in mid-frontal regions, the insula, precuneus and visual areas in both groups (Fig. 3). At the group level, we found signiﬁcantly higher activation in the DMPFC region (superior frontal/paracingulate, BA 8; 8744 mm3) for LTM compared to MNP.  3 A technical problem with the track ball lead to a high amount of missing responses in  three cases (19, 15 and 10 out of 24).  962  J.

NNSC negative not self-critical, NT neutral, SC self-critical, SP self-praising.  The contrast SP N NT resulted in similar but larger and stronger activations compared to SC N NT in both groups (Fig. 3). In the group comparison, LTM again showed signiﬁcantly more activation in the DMPFC during SP N NT (BA 6, 17,400 mm3). Additionally, we found increased activation for LTM compared to MNP in widespread clusters, covering left middlefrontal, bilateral inferior prefrontal and insular areas, basal ganglia, visual areas including the fusiform gyrus, and mid-brain, thalamus, and adjacent left hippocampal/amygdalar regions.  The conjunction analysis of SC and SP stimuli versus NT resulted in a  signiﬁcant group difference in the DMPFC area (Table 2).  Note that middle-frontal, mid-brain, and hippocampal/amygdalar regions were signiﬁcantly activated in LTM in the SP N NT and SC N NT, while we found no such activations for MNP. While this difference survived the corrected group comparison only in the SP N NT contrast, it hints at a quantitative rather than qualitative difference in these regions between SC N NT and SP N NT for the group comparison (Fig. 3).  Correlation results  Correlation analysis between mean activation of the DMPFC cluster resulting from the conjunction analysis (see Appendix F, Fig. 4) and the FFMQ factors observe and non-react revealed signiﬁcant correlations with non-react. For SP N NT it was r(39) = .32, p = .04. Examining the individual groups, we found that the correlation was driven by LTM (r(19) = .49, p = .03), while there was no signiﬁcant association in MNP (r(20) = −.18, p = .44). The difference between the regression slopes after a Fisher-r–z transformation was signiﬁcant (z = 2.10, p = .04) (Fig. 4b). For SC N NT, we found a signiﬁcant correlation for both groups together (r(39) = .34, p = .03) and a trend for LTM (r(19) = .39, p = .09), while MNP showed no correlation (r(20) = −.09, p = .70) (Fig. 4a). However, the correlation coefﬁcients did not differ signiﬁcantly between groups (z = 1.49, p = .14). DMPFC activation was not related to hours of meditation training or practice intensity (p N .20).  Table 1 Sociodemographic variables of subjects included in fMRI analysis.  Psycho-physiological interaction  For LTM, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference in the linear relation (PPI effect) between the DMPFC and another region in the brain during self-related emotional conditions (EMO) compared to NT. For MNP, we found a positive PPI effect for EMO compared to NT, in regions comprising the precuneus area extending into occipital/superior parietal regions (left and right), and a cluster in the left temporal gyrus. In the group comparison MNP N LTM, we found similar regions, namely clusters in the precuneus/occipital areas (see Fig. 5), indicating that MNP showed stronger functional connectivity with these regions during EMO compared to NT conditions (for a schematic representation see Supplementary Material, Fig. 5).  Discussion  This study investigated trait differences in behavioral and neural correlates of individualized positive and negative self-appraisals between mindfulness meditators and meditation-naïve participants, during a non-meditation task. We hypothesized habitual differences between these groups when confronted with self-referential emotional stimuli, more speciﬁcally a decreased emotional reactivity to such stimuli in meditators. Indeed, we found less extreme affective ratings after selfappraisals in this group. On the neural level, they showed more pronounced activation during self-appraisals in frontal and limbic regions, particularly during positive self-appraisal. Further, their DMPFC activation correlated with a non-reacting attitude towards inner experience and was less functionally connected with posterior mid-line and parietal regions.  Questionnaire and behavioral results  To our surprise, the groups showed only few differences in measures of mindfulness and related constructs. One reason could be the limited comparability of self-report mindfulness questionnaires between meditators and non-meditators (Grossman and Van Dam, 2011; Van Dam et al., 2009) despite matched samples (Baer, 2011). Our groups differed in the factor non-react, reﬂecting a difference in general emotion regulation, i.e., allowing inner experiences and feelings to come and go (Hölzel et al., 2011). Non-react has been found to predict general well-being, decreased psychological symptoms (Baer et al., 2006), and increases with mindfulness training (Baer et al., 2008). For self-compassion we only found a group difference in the total score at trend level, and only if not corrected for multiple-comparisons. Again, this is somewhat surprising, given the reported relations between mindfulness and selfcompassion (Hollis-Walker and Colosimo, 2011). One reason might be that open monitoring techniques have no particular focus on selfcompassion (Lutz et al., 2007). Thus, other factors such as life-style or working in the ﬁeld of mental health might inﬂuence the level of selfcompassion similarly or more (Baer et al., 2008). Overall, the fact that the groups did not differ more regarding the questionnaires might also reﬂect a strength of the current study. We ensured a good matching of LTM with a healthy control group, consisting of equally high-functioning individuals, with on average good education, high levels of intelligence, and a comparable percentage working in mental health related areas. Thus, group differences we do ﬁnd in our study are arguably also less inﬂuenced by selection bias and demand characteristics, which are potential confounds in cross-sectional studies with meditators (Davidson, 2010).

This interpretation is corroborated by the fact that we did not ﬁnd a difference in affective ratings after NT blocks and that the number  of chosen adjectives and their evaluation before the scan was the same for the two groups.

The tendency of lower TAS scores in our LTM sample points into the same direction. Thus, differences in affective ratings between groups must be interpreted with caution.  FMRI results  In general SC and SP showed similar activation patterns, in both groups. Brühl et al. (2014) also reported similar activation during selfcriticism and self-praise, corroborating the notion that different emotional experiences share similar brain regions (Lindquist et al., 2012). Group differences were hypothesized in emotion processing, self-referential and regulative prefrontal areas.  Differences in emotion generative structures during self-criticism and self-praise  Unlike the previous study by Doerig et al. (2014), we observed no consistent amygdala activation during SC. On this basis, our hypothesis regarding group-differences in this region cannot be answered completely. However, LTM showed activation bordering the left hippocampus/ amygdala region for SC N NT and a similar activation during SP N NT, while we found no such pattern for MNP. Only the latter was signiﬁcantly different in the group comparison. For these regions, we propose a quantitative threshold effect rather than a qualitative difference, and interpret that LTM show evidence for stronger emotional processing of both selfreferential conditions compared to NT. We found a similar pattern for visual cortex activations, which could reﬂect less cognitive avoidance (Servaas et al., 2014), again suggesting stronger emotional processing in  a)     T N > C S e g n a h c   l  a n g s   %  i  0.4  0.2  0.0  b)  0.4     T N > P S e g n a h c   l  a n g s   %  i  0.2  0.0  0.2  MNP  LTM  15  25  20 Non react  30  35  15  25  20 Non react  30  35  Fig. 4.

In fact, differential activation in the DMPFC has also been reported in relation to emotion regulation, in studies on reappraisal of negative pictures (Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). However, studies also report decreased MPFC activation in meditators during emotional processing in a mindful state (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007; Grant et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2011), and less mid-line, default mode activation during resting state (Brewer et al., 2011). Differences in meditation experience might partly explain these inconsistencies. Deactivations are particularly reported for very experienced meditators (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007; Chiesa et al., 2013). As we found no correlation with meditation experience in this region we cannot add further evidence for this hypothesis. Other reasons for the contradictory results might lie in the speciﬁc task (e.g., active self-reference) and location of mid-line activation (dorsal versus ventral).  In our experiment, the positive relation between DMPFC activation and the factor non-react supports the interpretation of the DMPFC activation as a functional correlate of cognitive, appraising processes (Etkin et al., 2011), which in the case of LTM might illustrate an accepting and non-reactive appraisal of inner experience. The fact that the correlations seemed mostly driven by LTM, at least for SP, might indicate a behavioral shift in the reaction towards positive self-appraisals, which might be distinctive for meditation practitioners.  Similar to the DMPFC, LTM showed increased activations in lateral mid- and inferior prefrontal regions during SC and SP versus NT, with the latter surviving the group comparison. Apart from the interpretation as a typical emotion regulation area (Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Phillips et al., 2003), mindfulness related interpretations have been suggested for lateral prefrontal areas, such as cognitive labeling of emotional stimuli (Hariri et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2003), focused attention and open awareness (Manna et al., 2010), or the ability to observe thoughts and emotions in a detached manner (Fox et al., 2014). Taken together, differential activations in frontal regions could reﬂect stronger self-awareness and focus on inner feelings, and mindful emotion regulation in the sense of a non-reactive attitude towards these experiences in LTM.  Differential functional connectivity during SP and SC between groups  We found positive functional coupling between the DMPFC and regions in the precuneus and occipito-parietal lobe for self-relevant emotional conditions compared to neutral words in MNP. Functional coupling in these regions was also signiﬁcantly stronger in MNP compared to LTM. In LTM, emotional self-related stimuli did not result in differential functional connectivity between the DMPFC and other regions. The precuneus is part of the default mode network and has been implicated in general autobiographical memory retrieval and selfprocessing (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Northoff et al., 2006), while the adjacent occipito-parietal areas are relevant for visual attention (Pessoa et al., 2002). The stronger, positive functional coupling between midline regions in MNP might reﬂect stronger self-focus or attentional processing when facing emotional self-referential words compared to neutral words, while attention and/or self-focus seemed less inﬂuenced by stimulus type in LTM. A similar interpretation, namely reduced selffocused attention in meditators, was put forward by Garrison et al. (2014), who found reduced functional connectivity in the precuneus/ PCC in meditators during loving kindness meditation. However, these interpretations remain tentative and should ideally be corroborated with behavioral measures on the degree of self-focused processing.  Limitations and future directions  Our interpretations of brain activations in meditators remain speculative, as our ﬁndings are only partially in line with previous studies in  Fig. 5.

Areas in the precuneus and occipito-parietal regions were found in both analyses.

These ﬁndings might reﬂect higher present-moment awareness and acceptance of emotions in this group, which is partly in line with the ﬁnding of decreased control over emotion generative structures during emotional stimulation in experienced meditators (Taylor et al., 2011). However, it contradicts previous ﬁndings of decreased activation in emotion-generative structures in meditators (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007; Chiesa et al., 2013).  For SP N NT, there was additional evidence for increased emotional processing in LTM compared to MNP. LTM showed increased activation in the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex/ventral striatum, which could indicate higher reward and subjective pleasantness of positive selfappraisals (Kühn and Gallinat, 2012; McClure et al., 2004). Further, the insula, another key region for emotion generation and experience, showed increased activation in LTM, which could signify stronger emotional arousal resulting from less regulation and more acceptance of emotional states (Grant et al., 2011), or higher emotional awareness and monitoring of internal states during self-related emotions (Craig, 2004; Lutz et al., 2008).  Overall, neural activations in emotion generative structures seemed increased for both valences in LTM, contradicting our behavioral results. A possible explanation is the timing of stimulation and rating: LTM might have been more accepting and aware of their immediate affective reaction during SP and SC blocks instead of regulating their experience. Such a nonreactive attitude could result in increased emotional processing during emotional stimulation, similar to ﬁndings by Taylor et al. (2011), while affective ratings after the actual experience might be less extreme.  Differential activation in regulative prefrontal and midline structures  Similar to previous studies by Doerig et al. (2014) and Brühl et al. (2014) we found activations in anterior and posterior cortical midline structures associated with self-referential and autobiographical memory processing and default mode self-reference (Fossati et al., 2003; Johnson, 2002; Northoff et al., 2006; Whitﬁeld-Gabrieli et al., 2011)  Interestingly, these mid-line activations were more pronounced in LTM in both contrasts. This is consistent with previous research: Creswell et al. (2007) found that higher dispositional mindfulness was associated with increased DMPFC activation in an affect labeling task, and Hölzel et al. (2007) found DMPFC activation in a similar sample of meditators during meditation compared to arithmetics and suggested increased processing of emotions, like being aware of, identifying and attending to one's emotions (Phan et al., 2004). This is in line with the common functional interpretation of the dorsal MPFC as the cognitive/  966  J. Lutz et al. / NeuroImage 124 (2016) 958–967  meditators and the interpretations draw from assumptions based on traditional claims that meditators approach emotional self-appraisals in “healthier” ways. At the same time, our cross-sectional design, cannot exclude that meditators are drawn to practices like meditation because they are more interested or in need of developing skills to deal with emotions. Similarly, they might differ in other relevant personality or life-style factors from MNP. Further, as mentioned earlier, we cannot exclude demand characteristics. Even though we feel it is important to study concepts of self-praise and self-criticism in experienced meditators, our results should be veriﬁed in longitudinal designs, especially as we found no signiﬁcant association between the amount of meditation training and activation in the DMPFC. Regarding our samples, both groups were healthy and rather high-functioning in terms of intelligence, highest degree and occupation. It will therefore be important to expand upon our results by conducting similar experiments in more diverse and clinical samples.  With introducing the self-praise condition, we probably lost the ability to study harsh self-criticism, as we did not observe stable amygdala activation during self-criticism. At the same time we found the biggest activations and group differences during SP. Thus we gained new insights into possible links between positive affect and mindfulness — a relationship we are only beginning to study and which needs further research. Such research should incorporate concepts of positive psychology like resilience, positive outlook on life, and well-being, to fully grasp the potential of mindfulness training in the clinical setting.  We observed differences in an active self-referential task. Still, group differences might be associated with underlying difference in the resting state. Future studies should ideally combine self-referential and resting state analysis to shed light on the relation between these two modes of self-processing.  Lastly, with our design we cannot fully disentangle emotional from self-referential aspects, since the neutral stimuli differed from selfcriticism and self-praise in valence as well as in self-reference. From a theoretical perspective, it would be difﬁcult to fully disentangle these two dimensions: On the one hand descriptions of aspect of the self are in most cases emotionally colored. On the other hand emotional stimuli per deﬁnition are salient to the individual and involve self-related processes. Future studies might employ factorial designs to try and disentangle the inﬂuence of these two dimensions.  Acknowledgments  This work was supported by the SNF Project number 320030_146972/2.

Introduction  Unintentional and uncontrollable processing of threat has been suggested to contribute to the pathology of social anxiety disorder (SAD). The present study investigated the neural correlates of processing task-irrelevant, highly ecologically valid, disorder-related stimuli as a function of symptom severity in SAD. Twenty-four SAD patients and 24 healthy controls (HC) performed a feature-based comparison task during functional magnetic resonance imaging, while task-irrelevant, disorder-related or neutral scenes were presented simultaneously at a different spatial position. SAD patients showed greater activity than HC in response to disorder-related versus neutral scenes in brain regions associated with self-referential processing (e.g. insula, precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) and emotion regulation (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), inferior frontal gyrus). Symptom severity was positively associated with amygdala activity, and negatively with activation in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dlPFC in SAD patients. Additional correlation analysis revealed that amygdala-prefrontal coupling was positively associated with symptom severity. A network of brain regions is thus involved in SAD patients' processing of task-irrelevant, complex, ecologically valid, disorder-related scenes. Furthermore, increasing symptom severity in SAD patients seems to reﬂect a growing imbalance between neural mechanisms related to stimulus-driven bottom-up and regulatory top-down processes resulting in dysfunctional regulation strategies. © 2017 The Authors.

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) describes the pathological fear of negative evaluation by other people. Patients suffering from SAD are characterized by anxiety in social interactions (e.g. small talk on parties, discussions) and performance situations (e.g. giving a speech, job interview) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). With a prevalence rate of 7–13% in Western countries (Furmark, 2002) and 12.1% in the USA (Kessler et al., 2005), SAD is one of the most frequent anxiety disorders. Automatic threat processing, that is, the attentional capture by, and the detection and processing of, threat stimuli that are outside the current attentional focus and/or task-irrelevant (Carretié, 2014; Moors and De Houwer, 2006), is considered a critical factor for the development and maintenance of SAD and other anxiety disorders (Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Morrison and Heimberg, 2013; Öhman and Mineka, 2001). Automatic processing as deﬁned here is often operationalized by engaging participants in a main task with neutral stimuli, while threat stimuli  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Institute of Medical Psychology and Systems Neuroscience,  University of Muenster, Von-Esmarch-Straße 52, D-48149 Muenster, Germany.

According to biased-competition models, the extent to which task-irrelevant stimuli are processed is strongly mediated by both topdown control and stimulus-driven bottom-up mechanisms (Beck and Kastner, 2009). Thus, unintentional processing of task-irrelevant threat stimuli may be caused by their strong exogenous inﬂuence on attention and enhanced sensory processing (bottom-up), which seems to be associated with increased amygdala activity in anxiety. Additionally, attentional control (top-down) may be reduced, due to altered prefrontal functioning (Bishop, 2008; Connor et al., 2004; Eysenck and Derakshan, 2011; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Öhman, 2005). This imbalance may well be aggravated with increasing anxiety (Bishop, 2009; Bishop et al., 2004b; Cisler and Koster, 2010; Eysenck and Derakshan, 2011), rendering the processing of threat more unintentional and uncontrollable, which represent two important indicators of automatic information processing (Bargh, 1994; Teachman et al., 2012).  Most functional imaging studies on brain responses during automatic processing of task-irrelevant threat stimuli in SAD presented emotional faces, which were judged with respect to emotion-irrelevant aspects such as gender discrimination (Blair, Shaywitz, et al., 2008; Campbell et al., 2007; Gentili et al., 2008; Stein et al., 2002; Straube et al., 2004). Other studies either used gender judgment on stimuli with  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2017.01.020 2213-1582/© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Heitmann et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 14 (2017) 323–333  emotional prosody (Quadﬂieg et al., 2008), disorder-related words in grammatical decision (Schmidt et al., 2010) or in an emotional Stroop task (Boehme et al., 2015). These studies particularly reported amygdala hyperactivation and less consistent hyperactivations in the insula, prefrontal regions (e.g. orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and superior temporal sulcus (STS) in SAD patients, suggesting emotional encoding even when the task does not focus on stimulus valence. These ﬁndings are in large parts compatible to those obtained when attention is not focused elsewhere (e.g. Heitmann et al., 2016; Klumpp et al., 2012; Straube et al., 2005). These studies without attentional restrictions present a neural network including amygdala, thalamus, insula, globus pallidus, ACC, mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, STS, cuneus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), associated with increased threat detection, abnormal self-referential processing and interoception in SAD patients (Brühl et al., 2014; Etkin and Wager, 2007; Freitas-Ferrari et al., 2010; Miskovic and Schmidt, 2012).  However, previous studies on automatic processing in SAD did not use a visually separated feature-based attention task with emotionally neutral stimuli (in the presence of task-irrelevant emotional distractor stimuli), or used emotional stimuli that were only partially relevant for SAD, such as faces (Schulz et al., 2013) or words, which are limited in their ecological validity. Thus, the question arises how patients with SAD process highly ecologically valid disorder-related stimuli, when these are task-irrelevant and presented spatially separate from the task stimuli. This situation, often encountered in real life outside the laboratory, is implemented in concurrent but distinct target-distractor (CDTD) tasks (Carretié, 2014). Previous studies in healthy participants (HC) could show that processing of task-irrelevant stimuli, although presented at a central position, is signiﬁcantly affected by a spatially non-overlapping main task (e.g. Mocaiber et al., 2010; Nordström and Wiens, 2012; Sand and Wiens, 2011; Wiens et al., 2012; Wiens et al., 2011). This task conﬁguration allows to investigate to which degree task-irrelevant emotional stimuli capture attention, and are processed even at task-irrelevant locations (Wiens et al., 2012).  The present study investigated neural correlates of such automatic, disorder-related scene processing in SAD patients and HC. We used visually complex, disorder-related scenes that depict situations SAD patients are afraid of (and neutral control scenes). We used such scenes as task-irrelevant stimuli in an attention-demanding CDTD task. The task-irrelevant scenes were presented at the center of the screen and the emotionally neutral task-stimuli above and below the scene.  Additionally, the inﬂuence of symptom severity was examined with correlation analysis. We expected increased automatic threat processing in SAD patients, reﬂected by hyperactivation in the regions related to affective processing in SAD (amygdala, insula, thalamus, globus pallidus, cingulate cortex, precuneus, STS and prefrontal cortex) (Brühl et al., 2014; Etkin and Wager, 2007; Freitas-Ferrari et al., 2010; Miskovic and Schmidt, 2012), relative to HC (interaction of Scene Type by Group: SAD patients N HC, disorder-related scenes N neutral scenes). Furthermore, we expected hyperactivations in SAD patients to increase with increasing symptom severity. Finally, based on biased-competition models suggesting diminished attentional control depending on interindividual differences in anxiety vulnerability (Bishop, 2008), we expected increasing symptom severity in SAD patients to be accompanied by reduced activation in prefrontal regions.  2. Materials and methods  2.1. Subjects  SAD patients were recruited via public notices, local paper ads and from a collaborating outpatient clinic. HC were selected from a volunteer database of the Collaborative Research Center “Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders” (TRR SFB 58; http://sfbtrr58.uni-muenster.de/) or were  recruited by means of ﬂyers and newspaper ads. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were right-handed (Oldﬁeld, 1971), met the general MRI-requirements, had no history of neurological diseases or psychotic disorders, did not currently take psychotropic medication, and were screened by a psychologist using the standardized clinical interview (SCID; Wittchen et al., 1997). SAD patients fulﬁlled the criteria for current generalized social anxiety disorder according to DSM-IV as main diagnosis. HC were free of any diagnosis. All participants completed the clinician-administered Liebowitz-Social-Anxiety-Scale (LSAS; Stangier and Heidenreich, 2005), Social Phobia Scale (SPS; Stangier et al., 1999b), Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; Stangier et al., 1999a), Fragebogen zur Selbstbeschreibung in sozialen Situationen (FSSS; Kolbeck, 2008), Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory (SPAI; Fydrich, 2003), and Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNE; Vormbrock and Neuser, 1983). To address depressive symptomatology all participants ﬁlled in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Hautzinger et al., 1995).  Out of 33 SAD patients, nine were excluded from statistical analysis due to a BDI score N 30 (n = 2), missing behavioral responses or technical problems (n = 2), misunderstanding of the behavioral task (n = 1), or b90% correct answers in the behavioral task (n = 4). Matched to the 24 SAD patients (17 female), a control group consisting of 24 HC (16 female), who had ≥90% correct answers in the behavioral task, was chosen. Patients and HC groups did not differ in gender, mean age, and educational attainment (see Table 1 for sample details).  Comorbid diagnoses in SAD patients (n = 9, multiple entries possible) were current Major Depression Episode (n = 2), speciﬁc phobia (n = 7), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (n = 1), and General Anxiety Disorder (n = 1). As expected, SAD patients scored higher than HC in all social anxiety-sensitive questionnaires (Table 1). BDI scores were also signiﬁcantly increased in SAD patients, but remained under the clinical signiﬁcance level, and were comparable to scores from other studies (e.g. Straube et al., 2004).  The study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Muenster, Germany.

Disorder-related scenes depict situations SAD patients are afraid of, for example giving a speech, a job interview, a discussion scene, or show persons with bodily symptoms due to anxiety. As in Heitmann et al. (2016), SAD patients in the current study rated the disorder-related versus neutral scenes as more unpleasant, arousing, and anxiety-inducing compared to HC (all P b 0.001, see Supplement ST1 and SF1).  The 50 disorder-related and 50 neutral scenes (with a resolution of 600 dpi, degree of visual angle: 6.3° × 4.73°) were each shown once in the center of a black screen for 800 ms in randomized order. Concurrently, two circles were presented, one above and one below the picture (distance between centers of circles: 7.79°), each with a horizontal or vertical bar inside (see Fig. 1). Participants had to solve a featurebased comparison task (in the style of CDTD-task; Carretié, 2014) and to push the left button on a response box when the bars in the circles had the same orientation, and the right button for bars with different orientation. The presented scenes were irrelevant for the task.  Stimulus presentation and response recording was controlled by Presentation software (version 17.2, Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA). Between stimulus presentations, a white ﬁxation cross was shown for an average time period of 3360 ms (jittered between 1280 ms and 12,200 ms; see Fig. 1). To increase signal discriminability (Dale, 1999), the random stimulus sequence was optimized using the “optimal sequencing” (optseq) algorithm (http://www.surfer.nmr. mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/). The duration of the experiment was approximately 7 min.  2.3. Behavioral data  To assess potential differences between SAD patients and HC in task performance, errors and reaction times (RT) were analyzed.  Incorrect answers, missing responses, trials with contradictory responses, outliers in RT (RT N mean + 2 SD; RT b 300 ms) were counted as errors. Only RTs of correct trials were included and logtransformed to compensate for skewness. Error and RT data were analyzed by means of repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with emotion (disorder-related or neutral) as withinsubjects factor and group (SAD or HC) as between-subjects factor. For the ANOVAs, a probability level of P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Post-hoc t-tests used to resolve interactions were Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons (corrected signiﬁcance level P b 0.0125). Furthermore, correlational analyses between symptom severity and number of errors as well as RTs were conducted. To account for the extensive and comprehensive symptomatology of SAD, a composite symptom severity score was calculated by averaging the standardized (z-transformed) scores in the six social anxiety-sensitive questionnaires used.  2.4. Functional MRI data  Anatomical and functional MRI data were acquired with a 3 T magnetic resonance scanner (“Magnetom PRISMA”, Siemens, Erlangen; GER) using a 20 channel head-neck coil. Functional data were measured using a T2*-weighted echo-planar sequence (TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, matrix = 92 × 92 voxels, FOV = 208 mm2, TR = 2080 ms). 215 volumes of 36 axial slices (thickness = 3 mm, 0.3 mm gap, in plane resolution = 2.26 mm × 2.26 mm) were acquired. To minimize susceptibility artifacts in inferior parts of anterior brain areas, the volumes were tilted approximately 20° from the AC/PC line. A shimming ﬁeld was applied before functional imaging, to reduce external magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneities.

Pre-processing and analysis of functional data were performed using Brain Voyager QX software (version 2.4, Brain Innovation, Maastricht, NL). The ﬁrst ten volumes were discarded from analysis to secure steady-state tissue magnetization. Volumes were realigned to the ﬁrst volume, to minimize effects of head movements on data analysis. No participant showed excessive head movement (N1 voxel). Further data preprocessing comprised spatial (6 mm full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel, FWHMK) as well as temporal (low pass ﬁlter: 2.8 s; high pass ﬁlter: 10 cycles in time course) smoothing. Anatomical and functional images were co-registered and normalized to Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). Finally, volumes were resampled to voxels of 2 × 2 × 2 mm and slice time correction was applied.  Multiple linear regression of the signal time course at each voxel was calculated. The expected blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal change for each predictor was modeled by a canonical doublegamma hemodynamic response function (HRF). In accordance with the behavioral analysis, only trials without errors (see above for deﬁnition of errors) were included in the functional analysis. The two predictors of interest were disorder-related scene and neutral scene (factor Scene Type). First, voxel-wise statistical maps were generated and predictor estimates (beta weights) were computed for each individual. Second, a random-effect group analysis of the individual contrasts was calculated.  Amygdala (dilated 1 mm in radius), insula (dilated 1 mm in radius), thalamus, globus pallidus, cingulate cortex, PFC, STS, precuneus, and cuneus served as Regions of Interest (ROIs), deﬁned a priori according to Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas (Maldjian et al., 2003; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) and transformed into Talairach space according to Lancaster et al. (2007) using ICBM2TAL in Matlab (version 8.2, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). Masks of all ROIs were combined into a single mask. In addition, we conducted an exploratory whole brain analysis to investigate reliable task-related activations outside the ROIs. Furthermore, a correlation between the composite symptom severity score and brain activity in the deﬁned ROIs during processing of disorder-related versus neutral scenes was calculated in SAD patients. To resolve the relationship between amygdala and prefrontal cortex, amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity was correlated with symptom severity in SAD patients. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was performed to explore emotion-dependent connectivity patterns between amygdala and prefrontal cortex in SAD patients for the contrast disorder-related N neutral scenes. The anatomical ROI for left amygdala for this contrast was deﬁned as seed region. PPI analysis was conducted with an interaction regressor that is the product of the HRF-convolved task regressor (psychological factor) and the seed region time course (physiological factor). In a second step, the relationship between amygdala-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity and symptom severity was analyzed by means of correlation analysis. Brodmann areas (BA) for all signiﬁcant activation clusters were identiﬁed with the Talairach client (Lancaster et al., 1997; Lancaster et al., 2000).  Statistical parametric maps resulting from voxel-wise analyses were considered signiﬁcant for clusters that survived cluster-based correction for multiple comparisons. For small-volume corrected analysis, a voxel-level threshold was initially set to P ≤ 0.005 (uncorrected, Lieberman and Cunningham, 2009), for whole-brain analysis to P ≤ 0.001. Cluster thresholds were calculated using a cluster-level statistical threshold plugin in Brain Voyager (Goebel et al., 2006) and carried out across the ROI mask (small-volume correction) and the whole-brain mask. Correction criteria were always based on the estimate of the maps' spatial smoothness and on an iterative procedure (Monte Carlo simulation) used to estimate cluster-level false-positive rates (Forman et al., 1995). After 1000 iterations, the minimum cluster size threshold that yielded a cluster-level false-positive rate of 5% was applied to the statistical maps.  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral data: Scene Type and Group  Analysis of errors yielded neither signiﬁcant main effects nor a signiﬁcant interaction (all P ≥ 0.118). The average number of errors was 5.88 ± 2.071 in SAD patients, and 5.08 ± 1.283 in HC (see Fig. 2). Thus, for both groups, ≥94% of all trials were included in fMRI data analysis. Similarly, analysis of RT in correct trials of the bar comparison task yielded neither signiﬁcant main effects nor a signiﬁcant interaction (all P ≥ 0.144; see Fig. 2). Correlational analyses in patients between the composite symptom-severity scores and number of errors (P ≥ 0.342) or RT (P ≥ 0.403) yielded no signiﬁcant effects.  3.2. fMRI data: interaction Scene Type by Group  Small-volume corrected analysis for the contrast disorder-related versus neutral scenes showed increased brain activation in SAD patients as compared to HC in the insula (BA13), STS (BA13, BA22), precuneus (BA7), and several frontal regions (BA6, BA8, BA9, BA32, BA45; see Table 2; Fig. 3).  Results of the exploratory whole-brain analysis are provided in Table 3. Activation patterns revealed by whole-brain analysis were largely consistent with activation clusters yielded by small-volume corrected analysis. Whole-brain analysis revealed additional activations in temporal lobe (BA13) and parahippocampal gyrus.  3.3. fMRI data: correlation analysis  Correlation analysis of brain activity within ROIs were calculated with a composite symptom severity score in patients, yielding higher activity in the amygdala and decreasing activity in the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC; BA8, BA9, BA10), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; BA32), posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC; BA31), and STS (BA13) with increasing symptom severity (see Table 4, Fig. 4).  To clarify the relationship between symptom severity and brain activation in SAD patients, amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity (seed: left amygdala) was correlated with symptom severity (see Table 5). This analysis yielded a positive correlation between symptom severity and amygdala-prefrontal coupling, with less affected SAD patients yielding more negative coupling, and thus an inverse relation between prefrontal activation and amygdala activation, and more severely affected SAD patients showing rather more positive coupling between these brain regions (see Fig. 5).  4. Discussion  The present study examined the neural correlates of unintentional and uncontrollable processing of disorder-related scenes and the inﬂuence of symptom severity in SAD patients by means of fMRI. For this purpose, SAD patients and HC had to solve a CDTD task (Carretié, 2014), in which the spatial orientation of bars at different screen positions had to be judged. At the same time, task-irrelevant disorder-related or neutral control scenes were presented. SAD patients and HC did not differ in task performance on the behavioral level, so behavioral differences cannot account for differences in brain activation. However, relative to HC, SAD patients exhibited increased activation in the insula, precuneus, STS and in several prefrontal regions during presentation of disorder-related versus neutral, task-irrelevant scenes. Moreover, correlation analysis in SAD patients showed that increasing symptom severity goes along with greater amygdala activity and decreased brain activity in prefrontal regions paralleled by a positive correlation between symptom severity and amygdala-prefrontal coupling. These results suggest enhanced automatic emotional processing of disorderrelated scenes in SAD in a broad neural network. Furthermore, differences in bottom-up and top-down emotional processes seem to be  C.Y. Heitmann et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 14 (2017) 323–333  327  Fig. 2.

In the following, the results will be discussed in detail.  Task-irrelevant disorder-related versus neutral scenes evoked hyperactivations in the insula, precuneus, STS, dmPFC, IFG, and dlPFC in SAD patients compared with HC, as shown by small-volume corrected analysis. These brain regions are considered to be part of the neural network involved in affective processing in SAD (Brühl et al., 2014; Etkin and Wager, 2007; Freitas-Ferrari et al., 2010; Miskovic and Schmidt, 2012). Their activation was observed especially under conditions without attentional restriction during emotional stimulus encoding (Heitmann et al., 2016; Klumpp et al., 2012; Straube et al., 2005), but some regions (insula, STS) also during automatic processing, such as with facial affect in gender discrimination tasks (Blair, Shaywitz, et al., 2008; Boehme et al., 2015; Gentili et al., 2008; Straube et al., 2004). Our results particularly indicate heightened self-referential processing in SAD patients in response to disorder-related versus neutral scenes, although the scenes were task-irrelevant and outside the focus of attention. Insula hyperactivation in particular was often reported in SAD studies (e.g. Amir et al., 2005; Gentili et al., 2009; Straube et al., 2004). It is associated with increased interoceptive processing and awareness of the subjective feeling of anxiety (Critchley et al., 2004; Menon and Uddin, 2010; Paulus and Stein, 2006), both assumed to be key elements in the pathophysiology of SAD (Clark and Wells, 1995; Rapee and Heimberg, 1997). Next to the insula, precuneus hyperactivation in SAD patients can also be interpreted as indicator of increased internal self-presentation and self-referential processing, involving episodic memory retrieval (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006). Note that precuneus activation was reported in SAD patients before (e.g. Gentili et al., 2015a,b; Gentili et al., 2009; Heitmann et al., 2016), but, to our knowledge, not yet under conditions of automatic processing. Together with the precuneus, the dmPFC is assumed to represent a critical structure of the Default-Mode Network (DMN) that plays an important role  in self-referential processing as well as in emotion regulation (Raichle et al., 2001; Schneider et al., 2008). Accordingly, mPFC hyperactivation is a common outcome in studies on affective processing in SAD, and is speciﬁcally attributed to enhanced self-focus and self-relevant memory retrieval (Blair, Geraci, et al., 2008; Gusnard et al., 2001; Heitmann et al., 2016; Moran et al., 2009; Northoff et al., 2006).  In addition to the structures described, which are mainly associated with self-referential processing, the present study also yielded hyperactivation of the STS in SAD patients during automatic disorder-related processing. STS hyperactivation in SAD patients was reported for emotional face processing (Gentili et al., 2015a; Gentili et al., 2008; Straube et al., 2005). STS activation is associated with social perception of visual cues, s in face perception and motion processing (Allison et al., 2000; Hein and Knight, 2008), and in the present study probably indicate the automatic processing of social attributes of disorder-related scenes. However, in addition to attentional capture by social stimulus attributes, STS activation is also taken to reﬂect top-down attentional control during attentional tasks, e.g. during irrelevant emotional face processing (Corbetta et al., 1998; Hopﬁnger et al., 2000; Narumoto et al., 2001; Tseng et al., 2014). Similarly, activations in the PFC, in particular dlPFC and IFG, may indicate that SAD patients engaged in topdown regulation and control of emotion concerning the distracting stimuli, to ensure appropriate task performance. First, the IFG is involved in a wide range of inhibitory cognitive control mechanisms, as required in CDTD tasks (Aron, 2007; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Tabibnia et al., 2011). Next, quite a few studies demonstrated dlPFC activation for emotion regulation and top-down attentional control (Cohen et al., 2000; MacDonald et al., 2000; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). In line with these observations, altered activation in prefrontal regions was reported in SAD, for example during emotion regulation (Brühl et al., 2013; Goldin et al., 2009; Ziv et al., 2013).  Whole-brain analysis supported the results of small-volume corrected analysis, and yielded additional hyperactivations in temporal  Table 2 Signiﬁcant hyperactivations for disorder-related versus neutral scenes in patients suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD) relative to healthy controls (HC) as revealed by small-volume corrected analysis (P ≤ 0.005 uncorrected, and P ≤ 0.05 corrected).

SAD patients display enhanced activation in the insula (z = 14), precuneus (x = 4), superior temporal gyrus (STS; x = 46), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; x = 36), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC; x = 5), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; z = 46) compared with HC.

The often reported amygdala hyperactivation as correlate of initial threat detection during automatic processing (Bishop, 2008; Schulz et al., 2013) could not be conﬁrmed by differential analysis in SAD patients in our study, but emerged in correlation analysis.  Correlation analysis yielded a strong positive correlation between symptom severity and brain activation in the left amygdala. In contrast, symptom severity correlated inversely, thus negatively, with activation in dlPFC, dACC, pMCC, and STS. The amygdala is described as a threat detector of incoming information (Bishop, 2008; Sergerie et al., 2008). It is assumed that amygdala activity contributes to facilitated attention and vigilance potentiation towards the salient stimulus, and to a subsequent  initiation of autonomic and behavioral responses (Janak and Tye, 2015; LeDoux, 2007; Öhman, 2005; Phelps and LeDoux, 2005). These functions of the amygdala explain its role in bottom-up, stimulus-driven processing during uncontrollable and unintentional stimulus processing and studies reporting heightened amygdala activity during automatic processing in SAD patients conﬁrm this (e.g. Boehme et al., 2015; Campbell et al., 2007; Gentili et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2010; Straube et al., 2004). Bottom-up emotional processing is stimulus-focused and depends on stimulus features such as personal signiﬁcance (McRae et al., 2012; Öhman and Mineka, 2001). When differences in bottom-up processing strength are reﬂected by amygdala activation, individual relevance of stimuli should matter. The personal relevance of  C.Y.

This interpretation is supported by studies in SAD patients reporting amygdala activity (Blair et al., 2008) or behavioral indices of attentional bias in dot-probe tasks (e.g. Pishyar et al., 2008; Stevens et al., 2009) to correlate with symptom severity. However, our behavioral data do not support this, since there was no correlation with symptom severity in reaction times, error or rating data. But note also that the reported studies used a different kind of experimental design to investigate attentional bias in SAD. Furthermore, effects of automatic processing are not necessarily observable on the behavioral level (Schulz et al., 2013; Teachman et al., 2012) and the rating procedure unlike the fMRI paradigm required an explicit emotion evaluation.  Biased competition models of attention suggest automatic stimulus processing to be mediated by bottom-up mechanisms as well as topdown attentional control (Beck and Kastner, 2009). Prefrontal regions such as dlPFC, IFG, and ACC are considered highly relevant for attentional control (Aron, 2007; Bishop, 2008; Bishop et al., 2004a; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). In the present study, differential analysis showed hyperactivations of dlPFC and IFG in SAD patients versus HC during disorder-related, task-irrelevant processing, which were interpreted as indicators of enhanced regulatory processing for disorder-related versus neutral scenes. Correlation analysis revealed that for disorder-related versus neutral scenes, prefrontal activation (dlPFC, dACC) decreased with increasing symptom severity in SAD patients. It should be noted that the same regions, which are involved in several executive control functions, also show increased activation in explicitly anxiety-inducing designs (Boehme et al., 2014; Crottaz-Herbette and Menon, 2006; Etkin et al., 2011; Straube et al., 2006, 2007), the role of activations seems to differ depending on explicit and implicit emotional experimental designs. While explicit tasks induce increased top-down processing of highly salient emotional stimuli, more or less adaptive anxiety responses and general behavioral activation, implicit tasks require stronger executive control and inhibition of emotional distractor  processing. Prefrontal activation, including activation in dACC helps to amplify task-relevant activation and to diminish task-irrelevant activation (Bishop, 2008; Crottaz-Herbette and Menon, 2006).  The present correlational results might be interpreted in terms of Bishop's (2008) model, in which decreased prefrontal activation is taken to reﬂect impoverished attentional control of task-irrelevant emotional information. In addition, more severely affected patients might exhibit low abilities to cope with emotional distress, for example by means of attentional control. Both impairments might explain the correlational results, and ﬁt with studies reporting decreasing attentional control with increasing anxiety in HC (Bishop, 2009; Bishop et al., 2004a; Bishop et al., 2007).  Furthermore, prefrontal regions are suggested to mediate emotional processing due to down-regulation of the amygdala (Kim et al., 2011a; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Quirk and Beer, 2006), which might explain the inverse association between brain activity in these brain regions and symptom severity in SAD patients. This assumption is conﬁrmed by the correlation analysis, showing amygdala-prefrontal coupling to be positively correlated with symptom severity, so that less affected SAD patients exhibited more negative connectivity, and more severely affected SAD patients more positive connectivity. Negative connectivity means a negative correlation in activation strength depending on stimulus condition, which might be related to suppression of amygdala activation by prefrontal cortex to disorder-related scenes (Gee et al., 2013). In line with this, less affected SAD patients exhibited even greater amygdala activity for neutral than for disorder-related scenes, which might be a result of down-regulation within the process of effective attentional control. In contrast, positive connectivity would relate to positively correlated activation increases in both regions depending on stimulus condition, and might indicate unsuccessful attempts to (down)-regulate amygdala responses and thus impaired regulatory functioning (e.g. Gee et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2011b).  Some limitations of the current studies need to be mentioned. Performance data did not yield an interference effect in SAD patients,  Table 4 Signiﬁcant correlation of beta-weights (disorder-related versus neutral scenes) with a composite symptom severity score of six social anxiety-sensitive questionnaires in patients suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD) as revealed by small-volume corrected analysis (P ≤ 0.005 uncorrected, and P ≤ 0.05 corrected).

Heitmann et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 14 (2017) 323–333  331  On the basis of the current fMRI data, it is not possible to decide whether our stimulus arrangement induced one automatic ﬁxation of the scene, or whether participants engaged in several short ﬁxations, for example when switching between the task stimuli. Thus, further investigations are needed to shed light on the speciﬁc mechanisms underlying task-irrelevant threat processing. Eye-tracking would allow to determine whether and how task-irrelevant stimuli are ﬁxated, and what impact ﬁxation has on disorder-related scene processing in a CDTD task design as used here.  Finally, our disorder-related stimuli contain more scenes in which the observer perspective was self-related (i.e. looking over someone's shoulder or being in the situation) than the neutral scenes, which was an intended manipulation. Future studies might investigate whether self-relatedness is a driving factor that is differentially processed in SAD as compared to HC.  5. Conclusions  In sum, results indicate that SAD patients process ecologically valid, disorder-related stimuli automatically, even when these are task-irrelevant and presented at a different spatial location than the task. The higher activations observed in SAD patients point to emotional processing mechanisms associated with particular higher cognitive functions (e.g. self-referential processing, emotion regulation) although the disorder-related stimuli were task-irrelevant. Furthermore, results suggest that increasing symptom severity is characterized by a growing imbalance between neural mechanisms related to stimulus-driven bottomup and regulatory top-down processes that is mediated by an impaired regulatory amygdala-prefrontal coupling.

Alterations in Theory-of-Mind (ToM), or mentalizing skills, are a hallmark feature of schizophrenia, and are also evident in individuals exposed to childhood trauma. However, the impact of childhood trauma exposure on brain function during social cognition in schizophrenia remains unclear. We thus examined the association between childhood trauma and brain function during the performance of a ToM task in 47 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an established visual-cartoon affective ToM task. Whole-brain multiple regression analysis was performed on ToM-related brain activation, with CTQ total score as regressor of interest, while accounting for the effects of age, sex, diagnosis, symptom severity, behavioural performance, intelligence and medications levels. First, using a small-volume correction approach within a mask made of key regions for ToM [including bilateral temporo-parietal junctions (TPJ), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/ precuneus], total CTQ scores were positively associated with activation of the PCC/precuneus. Second, exploratory analyses for the rest of the brain (i.e., ROIs masked-out), revealed a positive association between trauma exposure and activation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and a negative association with activation of the anterior section of the TPJ. These results suggest that childhood trauma exposure may, at least partially, contribute to functional alterations of brain regions essential for effective mental state inference in schizophrenia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction  Theory-of-Mind (ToM), or ‘mentalizing’, involves higher-order social cognitive processes to facilitate accurate understanding of others' thoughts, emotions and intentions (i.e., mental states), which in turn facilitates adaptive social behaviour (Wimmer and Perner, 1983). Deﬁcits in ToM are pervasive features of schizophrenia (Bora et al., 2009) that are known to impact social functioning (Couture et al., 2006) in both acute (Bora et al., 2009) and remitted patients (Sprong et al., 2007). Effective ToM processes are critically dependent on the functional  ⁎ Corresponding author at: School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales  Research Unit for Schizophrenia Epidemiology Randwick, NSW Australia.  E-mail addresses: y.quide@unsw.edu.au, yannquide@gmail.com (Y. Quidé).  integrity of ‘affective ToM’ and ‘cognitive ToM’ networks (Abu-Akel and Shamay-Tsoory, 2011). The temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are common to both networks; however, the ‘affective ToM’ network also involves the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), ventral striatum, amygdala, temporal poles, while the ‘cognitive ToM’ network involves the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dorsal ACC (dACC) and the dorsal striatum (Abu-Akel and Shamay-Tsoory, 2011). A recent meta-analysis of neural activation in schizophrenia during ToM tasks (including 9 studies comparing 133 schizophrenia patients to 140 healthy controls) revealed increased activation of the PCC, the STS and somatosensory cortices, and decreased  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2017.02.012 0920-9964/© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Similarly increased activation in the PCC and the TPJ and decreased activation in the mPFC have been reported in unaffected ﬁrst-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia (Mohnke et al., 2016).  In non-psychotic populations, exposure to childhood trauma is commonly associated with deﬁcits on higher cognitive processes (executive functions, working memory or emotional processes) and associated brain regions (Hart and Rubia, 2012). Importantly, alterations of social cognitive skills are evident in maltreated youths (Benarous et al., 2015; Luke and Banerjee, 2013) and ostensibly healthy adults (Germine et al., 2015), and adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (Nazarov et al., 2014). Childhood maltreatment is associated with increased centrality (i.e., the importance of a node in a network) of the right precuneus and the right anterior insula, and reduced importance of the left ACC, in brain networks sustaining social cognitive skills (such as emotion regulation, mental state inference, ascribing intentions or beliefs to others; Teicher et al., 2014). Consistently, increased amygdala activation has been found in trauma-exposed patients with chronic depression performing an affective ToM task (Hentze et al., 2016), consistent with similar patterns of amygdala hyper-activation reported in trauma-exposed (healthy) individuals performing a facematching task (Dannlowski et al., 2012).  Exposure to childhood trauma is also a signiﬁcant risk factor for psychosis (Green et al., 2014; Read et al., 2014) that impacts morphology and function of key brain regions for cognition in these populations. In mixed samples of psychotic disorders (i.e., comprising schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic bipolar cases), exposure to sexual abuse has been associated with decreased grey matter in the left dlPFC and the ACC (Shefﬁeld et al., 2013), while exposure to any type of childhood trauma has been associated with increased activation of the left inferior parietal lobule when performing a working memory task (Quidé et al., 2016). In schizophrenia, exposure to emotional neglect has been associated with reduced grey matter volume of the right dlPFC (Cancel et al., 2015), while exposure to sexual abuse and physical neglect were associated with aberrant amygdala-PCC/precuneus functional connectivity during an emotion-processing task (Cancel et al., 2017). These regions show considerable overlap with brain regions implicated in ToM performance, suggesting that trauma-exposure may contribute to brain functional alterations associated with social cognitive impairments, as previously described in schizophrenia (Mrizak et al., 2016). Despite the high prevalence of trauma exposure in schizophrenia (Larsson et al., 2013; Matheson et al., 2013) and evidence for trauma-related ToM deﬁcits, the effects of childhood trauma on ToM brain function in schizophrenia have not yet been investigated.  We thus set out to investigate the effects of childhood trauma exposure on brain function associated with ToM processes in a sample of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Speciﬁcally, we investigated the associations between exposure to childhood trauma (Bernstein et al., 2003) and brain activation (blood oxygenation level dependent signal changes) occurring during the performance of a wellcharacterized and robust ToM task. Unlike its extended version (Schnell et al., 2011), the two conditions version of the ToM task used here, does not distinguish between affective and cognitive ToM processes (Mohnke et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2011). We expected that childhood trauma would be associated with increased activation within a mask of ToM-related key regions derived from van Overwalle's meta-analysis (Van Overwalle, 2009), including bilateral TPJ, the PCC/precuneus and the mPFC. We also explored the potential associations between childhood trauma exposure and activation of brain regions outside these regions.  2. Materials and methods  2.1. Participants  All participants provided informed consent according to procedures approved by the UNSW Human Research Ethics committees  (HC12384), the South East Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service (HREC 09/081) and St Vincent's Hospital (HREC/10/SVH/9). Participants were 47 clinical cases meeting ICD-10 criteria (W.H.O., 2008) for schizophrenia (n = 29) or schizoaffective disorder (n = 18), recruited from local area health services, the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB; Loughland et al., 2010) and by advertisement in the local community. Exclusion criteria included inability to communicate sufﬁciently in English, current neurological disorder, any history of head injuries with loss of consciousness, a diagnosis of substance abuse/dependence in the past six months, and having received electroconvulsive therapy in the previous six months.  2.2. Materials  Clinical diagnoses according to ICD-10 criteria were derived using the OPCRIT algorithm (McGufﬁn and Farmer, 1991) applied to interviewer ratings on the Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis (Castle et al., 2006). Current symptom severity was determined using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay et al., 1989), current Intellectual Quotient (IQ) levels were measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; Wechsler, 1999), and handedness was determined using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldﬁeld, 1971). Exposure to childhood trauma was measured using the short form (25 items) of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 2003). The CTQ is a self-report questionnaire that measures childhood (before age 12 years) trauma exposure on domains of emotional (EA), physical (PA) and sexual (SA) abuse, as well as physical (PN) and emotional (EN) neglect. For each domain, a score is calculated from 5 items, each rated with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 5 (very often true); responses within each domain were summed, and scores within the Moderate to Extreme range (i.e., EA N 12; PA N 9; SA N 7; EN N 14; PN N 9) on any one of these domains indicates signiﬁcant trauma severity (Mørkved et al., 2016; Quidé et al., 2016; Shannon et al., 2011). Due to high correlation among CTQ domains (Table 1) and because 38% of the present sample reported exposure to signiﬁcant trauma severity on multiple CTQ domains (Table 2), we used the CTQ total score for focal functional brain imaging analyses.  2.3. Theory-of-Mind (ToM) task  The ToM task was developed for use in functional neuroimaging studies (Schnell et al., 2011) and demonstrates excellent reliability (0.76 b ICC b 0.82) of ToM-related brain activity (Mohnke et al., 2014). In its shortened version with two conditions, that is, a control condition and an affective ToM condition (Mohnke et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2011), it does not distinguish between affective and cognitive ToM processes and is not particularly sensitive to behavioural performance (Mohnke et al., 2014). The task employed a block-design that alternates between 8 blocks of ‘ToM’ and 8 blocks of ‘Control’ conditions (total paradigm time: 480 s). Each block comprised 4 frames: an instruction frame (6.53 s), followed by a cartoon story in three consecutive frames (22.58 s; 7.53 s per image). For the control conditions, participants counted the number of living characters in the cartoon frames and determined if there was a change (same, more or less) between frames. For the ToM condition, participants were required to report whether the protagonist's affect would be expected to have changed according to the circumstances, by speciﬁcally indicating whether the affective state of the protagonist would be expected to be the same as, better, or worse than, the previous picture in the cartoon sequence. Pictures were free of direct emotional cues such as characters' facial expressions to avoid simple activation of emotion perception networks.  Stimuli were displayed on a Philips LCD monitor at the rear of the magnet, viewed by the participant via a standard head coil mirror. A Cedrus Lumina response box was used to measure behavioural responses. All participants underwent an “ofﬂine” task training session before the fMRI data acquisition. Accuracy in the different conditions  164  Y.

Images acquisition and processing  We acquired 240 whole-brain T2* weighted echo-planar images (EPI); slice thickness 4 mm, 0.3 mm gap, 32 axial slices in ascending order, TR 2000 ms, TE 30 ms, ﬂip angle 80°, matrix 96 × 96, ﬁeld of view 240 mm, on a Philips Achieva 3 T scanner, housed at Neuroscience Research Australia (Randwick, NSW, Australia). A high-resolution T1weighted anatomical scan (MPRAGE) was also obtained for each participant for registration and screening; TR 8.9 ms, TE 4.1 ms, ﬁeld of view 240 mm, matrix 268 × 268, 200 sagittal slices, slice thickness 0.9 mm (no gap).  Image processing and all analyses were performed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK; http://www. ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) in Matlab r2011b (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). The ﬁrst ﬁve volumes were automatically discarded to allow for magnetic stabilization. Following manual re-orientation to the AC-PC line, images for each participant were slice-timing corrected, realigned to the ﬁrst image in the sequence to help correct for head motion, and anatomical images were co-registered to the mean functional image. Scans were screened for stability (b2 mm head movement; b2° rotation), image artifact, and structural abnormalities and were then spatially normalised into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using a non-linear 12-parameter afﬁne transformation, re-sliced to 2 × 2 × 2 mm voxels and ﬁnally smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel set at 8 mm full-width half-maximum. After ﬁrst-level modeling, scans for all participants were additionally inspected for movements and intensity artifacts using the Artifact Detection Toolbox for SPM8 (ART; https://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/).

Only participants showing 10% or less outlier for each task condition separately, as well as for the whole run, were conserved for further analyses.  Finally, the data were high-pass ﬁltered using a cut-off of 128 s and the autoregressive (AR1) function was applied. To help account for movement and image intensity-related variance, the regressors obtained after ART inspection were added to the design matrix at the ﬁrstlevel; this includes regressors for movement (n = 6) and global signal intensity (n = 1) across all subjects, as well as individual potential outliers. Also, variance accounted for the instructions and the button presses were modelled as separate conditions and were added as regressors of no-interest to the design matrix. A ﬁrst-level (individual) step modelled contrasts for the different conditions (‘ToM’, ‘Control’, ‘ToM N Control’). Individual (‘ToM N Control’) contrasts were used in second-level steps.  2.5. Analyses  Whole-brain multiple regression analyses were performed on brain function during mentalizing (‘ToM N Control’), with CTQ total score as regressor of interest, and age, sex, diagnosis (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), behavioural performance (ToM accuracy and reaction time), PANSS total score, medication (imipramine and chlorpromazine equivalent dosages for antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, respectively, and mood stabilizer use) and IQ levels as covariates of no-interest. First, a family-wise error correction within an unique mask (small volume correction [p(SVC-FWE) = 0.05]) made of large functional regions-of-interest (ROIs; 545–692 voxels) generated for the bilateral TPJ, dmPFC and PCC/precuneus [see (Mohnke et al., 2016) for details] was applied to an initial voxel-level threshold of p b 0.001 (uncorrected). Brieﬂy, the ROIs were created literaturebased on coordinates reported by van Overwalle's meta-analysis (Van Overwalle, 2009) using the TWURoi toolbox (Schubert et al., 2008). Second, to identify ToM-related brain function associated with trauma exposure in regions located outside these ROIs, a cluster-level familywise error (FWE)-correction [p(FWEc) b 0.05] was applied to an initial voxel-level threshold of p b 0.001 (uncorrected), masked-out for the ROIs mask. Finally, potential associations between childhood trauma exposure (CTQ total score) and behavioural performance (ToM accuracy and reaction-time) and IQ levels – as previously found associated with ToM in schizophrenia (Bora et al., 2009) and following childhood trauma exposure (Hart and Rubia, 2012) – were evaluated using additional Pearson's correlation.  3. Results  Sociodemographic, clinical and behavioural data are presented in Table 3. For the full sample, the ToM task engendered signiﬁcant activation of the bilateral dmPFC, dlPFC, vlPFC, TPJ, ACC, PCC, STS and  Y.

The SVC analysis indicated a signiﬁcant positive association between CTQ total scores and activation within the PCC/precuneus [R2 = 0.156; peak MNI coordinates (6,−54,30), k = 165, t35 = 4.86, z = 4.22, p(SVC-FWE) = 0.031] (see Fig. 2). The exploratory whole-brain analysis (excluding voxels from the ROIs), indicated a signiﬁcant positive association between CTQ total score and BOLD signal (R2 = 0.107) in a cluster including the right medial superior frontal gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus and the supplementary motor area [dmPFC; peak MNI coordinates (14,16,50), k = 140, t35 = 4.33, z = 3.84, p(FWEc) = 0.038] that was located posterior to the dmPFC ROI. In addition, a signiﬁcant negative association between BOLD signal and CTQ total score (R2 = 0.380) was revealed in a cluster encompassing the right Rolandic Operculum, superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and posterior insula [TPJ; peak MNI coordinates (54,-28,20), k = 154, t35 = 4.11, z = 3.69, p(FWEc) = 0.026]; this cluster was located anterior to the right TPJ ROI. Changes in BOLD signal in these regions were not associated with any of the other covariates.  Additional Pearson correlation revealed no signiﬁcant associations between CTQ total score and task performance (ToM accuracy: r = −0.013, p = 0.930; ToM reaction-time: r = −0.176, p = 0.238) or IQ levels (r = 0.014, p = 0.926).  4. Discussion  This is the ﬁrst study to investigate the long-term effects of childhood trauma exposure on social brain function in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder during the performance of a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) task. Results indicate that greater levels of childhood trauma exposure are associated with increased activation of the PCC/precuneus and dmPFC, and reduced activation of the right TPJ, regardless of diagnosis.

Effective ToM is critically dependent on the integrity of key brain regions including the PCC/precuneus, dmPFC and TPJ (Abu-Akel and Shamay-Tsoory, 2011). Consistent with our hypothesis, ToM-related activation of both the PCC/precuneus and the dmPFC were positively associated with childhood trauma exposure independently of any effect of trauma on task performance. During ToM, the PCC/precuneus is implicated in processing self-related information (Abu-Akel and Shamay-Tsoory, 2011; Spreng and Grady, 2010; Spreng et al., 2009), as well as in contributing to mental state understanding using mental imagery skills (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Schurz et al., 2014), while the dmPFC is involved in processing social and/or emotional content about others (Saxe and Powell, 2006). Whereas the dmPFC cluster reported here was posterior to the dmPFC ROI from a meta-analysis of brain regions involved in social cognition (Van Overwalle, 2009), it overlapped with the dmPFC/supplementary motor area (cluster 2; ROI#3) ROI from a more recent meta-analysis (Schurz et al., 2014), which suggests this region is involved in trait judgements, especially about unfamiliar others (Schurz et al., 2014; Van Overwalle, 2009). Unexpectedly, trauma exposure was associated with decreased activation in the TPJ, a region representing the nexus between mental inference and salience detection (Carter et al., 2012) in order to establish a social context (Carter and Huettel, 2013). The interpretation of these ﬁndings should also consider that the TPJ cluster identiﬁed in the present study is anterior to the TPJ ROI in van Overwalle's meta-analysis (Van Overwalle, 2009), but overlaps with the anterior TPJ (TPJa; ROI#7) ROI from the Schurz et al. meta-analysis (Schurz et al., 2014), of which the latter is associated with social animation and rational action to understand human action or behaviour (Mars et al., 2012; Schurz et al., 2014). Together, these results indicate that trauma-exposure may, at least partially, account for the development of functional brain alterations contributing to abnormally self-oriented mental imagery (through increased PCC/precuneus activation), misrepresentation of others intentions (through increased dmPFC activation), and/or misunderstanding of the social context of an action/behaviour (through decreased TPJa activation) during ToM. These trauma-related functional brain alterations may thus contribute to abnormal mental state inference in individuals who later develop schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Interestingly, the TPJ, PCC and mPFC have been recently implicated as part of an extended default-mode network (eDMN), engaged in perspectivetaking and empathizing when social-emotional stimuli, in particular negative emotions, are displayed (Gottlich et al., 2017). Future use of a network analysis will be required to conﬁrm this interpretation, since trauma exposure is likely to impact an extended network of brain regions that includes, but is not limited to, ToM regions (Teicher et al., 2014; Teicher et al., 2016).  The present ﬁndings should be considered in light of the following limitations. Given the adult age of this sample, and the use of retrospective reports of childhood trauma, it remains unclear as to whether these functional brain alterations began to form during early child development, potentially underlying deﬁcits in social and emotional functioning that are antecedent to schizophrenia; longitudinal studies are required to clarify the extent to which childhood trauma can be regarded as a primary cause of these brain disturbances. In addition, we were unable to identify the effects of domain-speciﬁc trauma without contamination from other domains due to the strong correlations between each other. This was, however, not the case for sexual abuse, but as only 5 cases reported signiﬁcant exposure to sexual abuse uniquely (see Table 2), we did not investigate the speciﬁc effects of this traumatic domain on ToM brain function. Other limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size, the high levels of medication among schizophrenia participants; although the dosage equivalents of the major classes were accounted for in focal analyses. Although we attempted to account for diagnosis in the analyses, we acknowledge that the inclusion of cases with schizoaffective disorder may have inﬂuenced the patterns of affective processing and/or symptoms within the sample. Finally, the ToM imaging paradigm used in this  166  Y. Quidé et al. / Schizophrenia Research 189 (2017) 162–168  Fig. 1. Main effect of task (‘ToM N Control’) within the schizophrenia sample.

(B) An explorative whole-brain analysis, masked-out for the ROIs, revealed a positive association between CTQ total score and activation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, in green, posterior to the mPFC ROI) and a negative association in the right anterior TPJ (in blue, anterior to the TPJ ROI).

This may, at least in part, explain the lack of association between behavioural variables and trauma exposure.  In conclusion, we show here that signiﬁcant trauma experienced in childhood is associated with functional variations in key brain regions for effective ToM (TPJ, PCC, dmPFC) in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Future studies of effective connectivity within ToM networks using graph theory or dynamic causal modelling, in longitudinal studies beginning in childhood, would assist in understanding the impact of childhood trauma on the functional circuitry associated with social cognition dysfunction in schizophrenia.

This research suggests attentional control and reappraisal may engage similar midline and lateral areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, ﬁndings are largely based on separate studies. Therefore, the extent to which mechanisms of implicit versus explicit regulation are independent or overlapping is not clear. In the current study, 49 healthy participants completed well-validated implicit and explicit regulation tasks in the form of attentional control and cognitive reappraisal during functional magnetic resonance imaging. During implicit regulation, participants identiﬁed a target letter in a string of letters superimposed on threatening faces. To manipulate attentional control, the letter string either consisted of all targets (‘Threat Low’ perceptual load), or was embedded among non-target letters (‘Threat High’ perceptual load). During cognitive reappraisal, participants were shown aversive images and instructed to use a cognitive approach to down-regulate negative aﬀect (‘Reappraise’) or to naturally experience emotions without altering them (‘Look-Negative’). Order of administration of tasks was counterbalanced across participants. Whole-brain results regarding frontal activity showed ventromedial PFC/ rostral In contrast, Reappraise > Look-Negative resulted in engagement of the dorsolateral PFC, ventrolateral PFC and dorsomedial PFC. In addition, results showed no relationship between accuracy during attentional control and self-reported negative aﬀect during cognitive reappraisal. Results indicate attentional control in the context of threat distractors and the reappraisal of negative images are supported by discrete, non-overlapping neurocircuitries.  recruited during Threat Low > Threat High.  anterior  cingulate  cortex was  1. Introduction  Negative stimuli are preferentially attended to (LeDoux, 1998; Öhman and Mineka, 2001; Yiend, 2010), therefore, the ability to adaptively manage emotional response to salient negative cues has a positive eﬀect on day-to-day functioning and psychological health (Gross and John, 2003; Gross and Muñoz, 1995; Koole and Rothermund, 2011). As such, understanding the neural underpinnings of eﬀectual emotion regulation is an intensive area of study, due in part to its relevance in psychiatric illnesses that are characterized by disturbances in aﬀect and maladaptive behaviors to cope with negative emotions. Emotions unfold over time and various strategies exist for modulating the emotion-generative process (Gross, 2002; Gross and John, 2003). One way to conceptualize diﬀerences in emotion regulation strategies is through a dual-processes framework, which considers  regulation in the context of two distinct, yet related, processes deﬁned by implicit and explicit operations (Gyurak et al., 2011). Distinction between the two forms stem from variations in the eﬀort used to alter an emotional experience (Mauss et al., 2007).  Implicit regulation refers to processes that modify an emotional response without deliberate intent or conscious supervision (Hopp et al., 2011; Koole and Rothermund, 2011). An important aspect of implicit regulation is attentional control (e.g., resolution of emotional interference), an antecedent-focused strategy as it inhibits an emotional response to a stimulus before it becomes fully activated (Gross and Thompson, 2007). Due to processing capacity limits (Desimone and Duncan, 1995), sensory-driven, bottom-up stimuli compete with higher-order cognitive goals for neural representation and the stimulus that ‘wins’ the competition guides action and behavior (Pessoa et al., 2002). Factors that impact attentional control include the salience of  ⁎ Correspondence to: University of Illinois at Chicago, 1747 W, Roosevelt Rd. (M/C 747), Rm 246, Chicago, IL 60608, USA.

Neuropsychologia xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx  distractors (e.g., negative versus neutral task-irrelevant cues) and task demands as demonstrated with paradigms that vary in perceptual load. For instance, according to load theory, when perceptual load is low (e.g., when cognitive goals are easy to execute), task-relevant resources are available (i.e., ‘leftover’) to process emotional distractors (Lavie et al., 2009). Conversely, when a cognitive goal exhausts capacity limits (e.g., when goals are diﬃcult to execute), the processing of salient distractors is attenuated (Lavie et al., 2004, 2009). Put another way, the higher the cognitive eﬀort directed at completing a goal, the lower the emotional interference linked to task-irrelevant stimuli.  At the neural level, eﬀectual implicit regulation is implicated when frontal regions are recruited [e.g., anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC), lateral areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)] and activity in central emotion processing regions (e.g., amygdala) are reduced (Etkin et al., 2011a; MacDonald, 2000). In support of load theory, Bishop and colleagues showed ACC, dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC), and parietal regions were engaged during high perceptual load relative to low perceptual load in the context of brieﬂy-presented threat and neutral face distractors (i.e., 200 ms (milliseconds)), indicating the high load condition was demanding of processing resources (Bishop et al., 2007). Diﬀerences in cognitive eﬀort were also observed at the behavioral level as accuracy was higher and response times shorter in the low relative to high load condition (Bishop et al., 2007). Moreover, an a priori analysis revealed increased amygdala reactivity to threat face distractors in the low relative to high perceptual load condition (Bishop et al., 2007). Taken together, threat distractors were only processed when the condition allowed for residual task-relevant resources. Here, load was manipulated with letter strings superimposed on faces where the identiﬁcation of a target letter (X or N) was either embedded in a mixed string of letters (high perceptual load) or a homogeneous string of target letters (low perceptual load). Thus, the letters, a source of neutral information, may have served as a distractor from the emotional face particularly under high load conditions, as evinced by an absence of amygdala reactivity in this condition (Bishop et al., 2007). Recently, using a similar task we observed ACC recruitment during low perceptual load when the cognitive goal was easy to execute and distractors were salient (Bunford et al., 2017b; Wheaton et al., 2014). These data are in line with accumulating evidence that eﬀective attentional control engages the ACC (Etkin et al., 2011a, 2011b; MacDonald, 2000; Etkin et al., 2006; Kanske and Kotz, 2011).  In contrast to implicit regulation, explicit regulation refers to a deliberate attempt to inhibit or alter an emotional state in a speciﬁc direction (Gross and John, 2003; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). A wellstudied form of explicit regulation is cognitive reappraisal, also an antecedent-focused emotion regulation approach that involves changing the meaning of an emotion-eliciting stimulus or situation to alter its emotional impact (Gross, 2013; Ochsner et al., 2012). Studies, including meta-analytic investigations (Buhle et al., 2014; Messina et al., 2015), have consistently shown that cognitive reappraisal involves widespread cortical recruitment including areas associated with implicit regulation such as the ACC, DLPFC, DMPFC, and VLPFC. Less consistent with implicit regulation is evidence of engagement in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle and superior temporal gyri, and parietal regions including the angular gyrus (Buhle et al., 2014; Kohn et al., 2014; Messina et al., 2015; Ochsner et al., 2012). Involvement of these regions in particular may be due to the fact that cognitive reappraisal involves many higher-order functions (e.g., appraisal, attention, inhibition, working memory) as well as semantic functions to facilitate the generation of alternative representations of emotional stimuli (Messina et al., 2015). Behaviorally, self-reported aﬀective state based on a Likert-type scale is a common index of on-line reappraisal ability. In a seminal study by Ochsner and colleagues (Ochsner et al., 2002) greater reappraisal facility qualiﬁed by a larger diﬀerence in selfreported aﬀect between reappraising negative images (‘Reappraise’) versus looking at negative images (‘Look Negative’) corresponded with  more activation in the ACC and supramarginal gyrus and, in another study, with DMPFC activity (Modinos et al., 2010). In further support of brain-behavioral relationships, we recently demonstrated that greater engagement of frontal regions predicted successful reappraisal using self-reported ratings (Klumpp et al., 2018).  In summary, the eﬀective management of emotions elicited by a salient cue can be attained by means of attentional control modulated by perceptual load or cognitive reappraisal. While neuroimaging studies suggests shared and unique mechanisms underlie these implicit and explicit emotion regulation approaches, information regarding the spatial distribution of these neural circuitries are based on discrete studies completed in parallel, separate samples. Therefore, further study is necessary. Findings have implications in identifying phenotypes among internalizing conditions such as anxiety, depression, or other conditions marked by emotion dysregulation (e.g., excessive negative aﬀect) or individuals at risk of developing internalizing psychopathologies. In particular, in highlighting the relevance of load theory in advancing our understanding of attentional control as it relates to psychological health, we and others have shown that individual diﬀerences in the anxiety spectrum (e.g., trait anxiety, social anxiety disorder) and traits that act as a vulnerability factor to anxiety and depression (e.g., behavioral inhibition; Muris et al., 2001) are frequently observed when perceptual load is low (Bishop et al., 2007; Bunford et al., 2017b; Wheaton et al., 2014). It has also been demonstrated that anxious and depressed individuals exhibit aberrant neurofunctional activity during cognitive reappraisal to negative stimuli (Fitzgerald et al., 2017; Goldin et al., 2009; Radke et al., 2017; Stephanou et al., 2017). Furthermore, neural activity (i.e., ACC, amygdala) during reappraisal and to negative distractors under low (relative to high) perceptual load conditions predicts symptom change after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in socially anxious patients (Klumpp et al., 2017a).  In addition, ﬁndings have implications for the treatment of individuals characterized by emotion dysregulation (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders). For example, CBT is directed at enhancing emotion regulation with an amalgam of approaches (e.g., Socratic questioning, logical empiricism, behavioral ‘experiments’) over the course of multiple sessions (e.g., Arch and Craske, 2009). Evidence reappraisal is used more frequently in anxious patients who participate in CBT (Moscovitch et al., 2012) and reports of increased attentional control following CBT (Lundh and Öst, 2001; Mattia et al., 1993; Pishyar et al., 2008) suggest our understanding of treatment mechanisms could be advanced as CBT encompasses strategies analogous to reappraisal but does not directly target attentional control. Indeed, if attentional control and reappraisal engage similar neural pathways, it is expected that attentional bias modiﬁcation interventions, which are less costly and more readily available than CBT (Price et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016), would increase reappraisal capability. Alternatively, if mechanisms are discrete, the rate of response and/or attrition could be improved by tailoring CBT components to a patient's level of regulation facility in terms of implicit and explicit strategies as proﬁciency in one may not extend to the other. Findings also have inferences for neuromodulation as shared involvement of a targeted region (e.g., DLPFC) would broadly impact regulation capacity regardless of the eﬀort and processes involved. Conversely, the existence of a more distinct distribution of neural function across forms of regulation may necessitate reﬁnement in the selection of neural targets directed at regulation-speciﬁc operations.  Therefore, the primary objective of the current study was to examine mechanisms of implicit regulation in accordance with load theory and mechanisms of explicit regulation by way of cognitive reappraisal in the same sample of healthy individuals. We hypothesized that in the context of negative stimuli, both tasks would recruit dorsal midline structures (e.g., DMPFC), lateral frontal regions (e.g., DLPFC, VLPFC), and ACC. We also expected patterns would point to regulationdependent systems, for example, distinction between regions strongly  2  J.M. Fitzgerald et al.  Neuropsychologia xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx  implicated in reappraisal (e.g., IFG, temporal regions) (Buhle et al., 2014; Kohn et al., 2014; Messina et al., 2015; Ochsner et al., 2012) but not attentional control and vice versa (Bishop et al., 2007; Bunford et al., 2017b; Etkin et al., 2011b, 2006; Kanske and Kotz, 2011; MacDonald, 2000). Beyond neuroimaging, we explored whether there was a relationship between accuracy related to a cognitive goal (i.e., attentional control) and aﬀective state related to reappraisal to aid in the characterization of distinct or shared mechanisms involving implicit and explicit regulation strategies.  2. Methods  2.1. Participants  Participants consisted of 49 healthy adults between the ages of 18–60 (25.24 ± 7.98) with 12–22 years of education (15.65 ± 2.41). Sixty-seven percent of the sample was female and racial and ethnic composition consisted of: 45% Caucasian, 29% Asian, 14% AfricanAmerican, and 12% unknown; 22% percent of the identiﬁed as Hispanic. Inclusion criteria were: (1) absence of any major medical or neurological illness or Axis I disorder as conﬁrmed by diagnostic interviewing with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV (SCID-IV; (First et al., 2002) conducted at screening by trained master's level clinicians, (2) ability to give informed consent, and (3) free from drugs on the day of testing as conﬁrmed by a urinary drug screen. Exclusion criteria for fMRI included (1) the presence of ferromagnetic objects within the body, (2) being pregnant or actively trying to become pregnant, (3) fear of enclosed spaces (e.g., claustrophobia), and (4) inability to lie still in an enclosed space. All participants completed a consent form approved by the local Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Participants were compensated for their time and all procedures complied with the Helsinki Declaration.  2.2. fMRI tasks  All participants completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks during fMRI in the form of the Emotional Faces Interference Task (EFIT) and the Emotion Regulation Task (ERT), respectively. Task order was counterbalanced across all participants to control for order eﬀects.  2.2.1. Emotional Faces Interference Task (EFIT)  EFIT was adapted from Bishop et al. (2007) for the inclusion of both angry and fearful faces involving both genders as emotional distractors, with the present version previously validated in our laboratory (Bunford et al., 2017a, 2017b; Klumpp et al., 2017a; Wheaton et al., 2014). The balance of gender was matched across emotional faces. Participants viewed a string of six letters superimposed on task-irrelevant face distractors (e.g., angry, fearful, neutral) and were asked to identify whether there was an N or X present as quickly and accurately as possible. Participants were not explicitly instructed to ignore faces and responses were collected via button press. For low perceptual load trials, the string was comprised entirely of target letters (NNNNN or XXXXX) and in high perceptual load trials, the string included a single target letter and ﬁve non-target consonants (HKMWZ) in randomized order. Thus, low perceptual load was comparatively easier to perform. Distractor faces were drawn from a standardized set of photographs and consisted of fearful, angry, and neutral expressions from 8 diﬀerent individuals (Ekman and Friesen, 1976). The experiment was completed over two separate runs, each comprising 12 blocks of 5 trials. A mixed block/event-related design was employed whereby perceptual load (low vs. high) varied across blocks and facial expression (fearful, angry, neutral) within blocks on a trial-by-trial basis. Images were presented for 200 ms followed by a ﬁxation cross presented for 1800 ms. Within blocks, trials were separated by a jittered inter-stimulus interval lasting 2–6 s (s); trials between blocks were separated by 4–8 s.  2.2.2. Emotion Regulation Task (ERT)  In addition to EFIT, participants completed ERT validated in other labs (Ochsner et al., 2002) as well as our own (Fitzgerald et al., 2016, 2017; Klumpp et al., 2017b; MacNamara et al., 2016; Phan et al., 2005; Rabinak et al., 2014). During ERT, participants used cognitive reappraisal to down-regulate negative aﬀect state in response to negative images. Participants were shown 64 negative and 32 neutral images from the International Aﬀective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 2008) across three conditions (Reappraise, Look-Negative, Look-Neutral). Participants were instructed to: 1) use a cognitive strategy to reduce negative aﬀect to aversive images (‘Reappraise’ condition); 2) attend to the emotional state elicited by aversive images (‘Look-Negative’ condition); or 3) view neutral images (‘Look-Neutral’ condition). Prior to scanning and as per protocol (Fitzgerald et al., 2016, 2017; Klumpp et al., 2017b; MacNamara et al., 2016; Phan et al., 2005; Rabinak et al., 2014), participants were instructed to employ the strategy of cognitive reappraisal to “reduce [their] negative aﬀect by making the image appear less emotional”. Consistent with prior studies (Fitzgerald et al., 2016, 2017; Gorka et al., 2016; Klumpp et al., 2017b; MacNamara et al., 2016; Ochsner et al., 2002; Rabinak et al., 2014) participants were provided examples to promote understanding of cognitive approaches to reduce a negative emotional response to an aversive image. For example, transforming the scenario depicted by an image into positive terms (e.g., women crying outside of a church could be alternatively interpreted as expressing tears of joy from a wedding ceremony rather than of sorrow from a funeral) and rationalizing or objectifying the content of the pictures (e.g., a woman with facial bruises could be translated as an actor wearing makeup rather than a victim of domestic abuse; Phan et al., 2005, p. 211). Participants completed eight practice trials using images not shown in the actual task to conﬁrm understanding of task instructions.  The ERT comprised two separate runs, each lasting a total of 5 min. Each run consisted of two 20 s blocks of each condition (four images presented for 5 s each without inter-stimulus interval). Blocks were interspersed by 20 s blocks of a ﬁxation cross. Prior to each block, an instruction screen (“Reappraise” or “Look”) was presented for 5 s. To assess behavioral responses, participants viewed a screen that asked them to answer the question “How negative do you feel?” for the collection of on-line subjective negative aﬀect ratings immediately following each block. Participants indicated their response on a 5-item Likert scale (1 = not at all; 5 = extremely) via a 5-button response.  2.3. Behavioral data analysis  To verify participants followed EFIT and ERT task instructions, behavioral data were submitted to Analysis of Variances (ANOVAs) for each paradigm. Signiﬁcant ANOVA ﬁndings were followed-up with simple eﬀects analysis. Two-tailed Pearson's correlations were used to explore potential relationships between accuracy during EFIT Threat Low > Threat High trials and self-reported aﬀective state during ERT Reappraise > Look-Negative trials.  2.4. fMRI acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis  FMRI scanning was performed on a 3 T Discovery System (General Electric Healthcare; Waukesha, WI) using a standard radiofrequency coil. Whole-brain functional images (i.e., blood oxygen level–dependent [BOLD]) were collected using the following parameters: TR = 2 s, TE = 25 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, ﬁeld of view = 22 × 22 cm2, acquisition matrix 64 × 64; 44 axial, 3-mm-thick slices with no gap. The ﬁrst 4 volumes from each run were discarded to allow magnetization to reach equilibrium.  Conventional preprocessing steps were completed in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software package (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Images were temporally corrected to account for slice time acquisition diﬀerences  3  J.M. Fitzgerald et al.  Neuropsychologia xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx  and spatially realigned to the mean image to correct for head movement while motion realignment parameters were entered as regressors of nointerest to control for minimal head movement during scanning. Functional images from all participants included in analysis met criteria for quality with minimal motion correction (movements were < 3 mm and < 3 degrees rotation in any one direction). Images were then normalized to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using the echo-planar imaging template, resampled to 2 × 2 × 2 voxels and smoothed with an 8 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel.  For each task, a general linear model was applied to the time series, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and with a 128 s high-pass ﬁlter. For EFIT, blocks of low and high perceptual load were modeled separately based on task-irrelevant face type (angry, fearful, and neutral) resulting in six regressors (angry low, angry high, fearful low, fearful high, neutral low, neutral high), the eﬀects of which were estimated for each voxel for each participant and taken to the second level for random eﬀects analysis. Since negative stimuli are more salient than neutral stimuli, fearful and angry emotional distractors were combined (i.e., ‘threat’ distractors) to maximize power. Our primary contrast of interest was Threat Low > Threat High perceptual load in order to isolate neural activation during attentional control when distractors were more salient (e.g., high emotional interference due to low perceptual load). The analyses was repeated using Neutral Low > Neutral High to conﬁrm that any signiﬁcant eﬀects were driven by threat distractors. For ERT, blocks of Reappraise, LookNegative, and Look-Neutral were modeled separately in relation to implicit baseline (i.e., ﬁxation cross), the eﬀects of which were estimated for each voxel for each participant and taken to the second level for random eﬀects analysis. Our primary objective was to examine neural engagement signiﬁcantly related to cognitive reappraisal in relation to emotional reactivity; therefore, the primary contrast of interest was Reappraise > Look-Negative.  One-sample t-tests were performed in order to characterize the activation driving the primary linear contrasts of interest, as opposed to interaction eﬀects. Following recent guidelines in response to concerns about false positives resulting from lenient signiﬁcance thresholds (Eklund et al., 2016; Woo et al., 2014), all clusters were considered signiﬁcant only when they surpassed family-wise error (FWE) correction adjusted for multiple comparisons across the entire brain at p < 0.05 and comprising at least 20 contiguous voxels. The Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) system (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) was used to aid in the interpretation of regions within large clusters of activity.  To examine potential overlap in neural engagement between EFIT and ERT, binary masks based on signiﬁcant activation detected in one form of regulation were created and subjected to a conjunction analysis by looking for overlap using the logical AND operator in the SPM MarsBar toolbox (Brett et al., 2002), in keeping with the approach used by prior guidelines (Nichols et al., 2005). Additionally, overlap was examined with the common region function in the xjView toolbox (http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview), which displays the product of values from the contrasts of interest. Overlap was assessed using the minimum statistic for signiﬁcance generated by SPM using a wholebrain FWE-correction.  In subsequent exploratory analyses, we controlled for individual diﬀerences in behavior by adding the diﬀerence score between Threat Low and Threat High accuracy (for EFIT) and the diﬀerence score between self-report ratings during Reappraise and Look-Negative (for ERT) as covariates of no-interest in the respective one-sample t-tests (i.e., Threat Low > Threat High; Reappraise > Look Negative). In addition, we also explored whether neural activation could be explained by variability in accuracy in EFIT and self-reported aﬀective state in ERT. These analyses were completed to test the possibility that individual diﬀerences in behavior and reappraisal ability may account for variability in the distribution of neural activation. All planned and exploratory analyses controlled for age and gender.  4  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral results  3.1.1. EFIT  With regard to accuracy, a 2 (Perceptual Load: Low, High) × 2 (Distractor Type: Threat, Neutral) repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a main eﬀect of load (F(1, 48) = 310.96, p < 0.001), a main eﬀect of distractor type (F(1, 48) = 5.46), p = 0.02)) but no load-bydistractor type interaction (p = 0.31). Follow-up, paired-tests showed participants were more accurate during low load (90 ± 15%) compared to high load conditions (62 ± 13%) [t(48)= 17.63, p < 0.001] and when neutral distractors were present (77 ± 14%) compared to threatening distractors (75 ± 13%) [t(48)= 2.34, p = 0.02]).  A 2 (Load: Low, High) × 2 (Distractor Type: Threat, Neutral) repeated measures ANOVA on reaction time revealed a main eﬀect of load [F(1, 48)= 191.97, p < 0.001] but no main eﬀect for distractor type (p = 0.20); there was no load-by-distractor type interaction (p = 0.45). Follow-up paired t-tests revealed participants were faster during low load trials (7412 ± 247 ms) compared to high load trials (1058 ± 347 ms) [t(48) = 13.86, p < 0.001]. Results for behavioral data for both tasks across all conditions are listed in Table 1.  3.1.2. ERT  Behavioral data for ERT was available for all participants except in the case of one participant who had missing ratings during the LookNeutral condition. As this participant's ratings were present for the primary contrast of interest, Reappraise (> Look-Negative), the participant was retained in all analyses. A repeated measures ANOVA for Reappraise, Look-Negative, Look-Neutral revealed a main eﬀect of condition [F(2, 94) = 70.71, p < 0.001]. In follow-up paired t-tests, participants rated feeling more negative following Look-Negative conditions (2.53 ± 0.82) compared to Look-Neutral (1.20 ± 0.32) conditions [t(47) = 10.24, p < 0.001]. As expected, participants showed a reduction in negative aﬀect following Reappraise (2.18 ± 0.78) in comparison to Look-Negative (t(48) = 3.33, p < 0.01).  3.1.3. Correlation between EFIT and ERT behavioral rata  Pearson's correlation showed no relationship between accuracy during EFIT Threat Low (> Threat High) and self-reported aﬀective state during Reappraise (> Look-Negative) (p > 0.48).  3.2. fMRI results: Independent Task Engagement  3.2.1.

Discussion  low (perceptual  load was high)  The present study evaluated independent and common neural functioning at the whole-brain level with validated paradigms of attentional control, a form of implicit emotion regulation, and cognitive reappraisal, a form of explicit regulation. During attentional control, we observed engagement of VMPFC/rACC, PCC, and IPL when threat interference was high (perceptual load was low) compared to when threat interference was (i.e., Threat Low > Threat High). No signiﬁcant clusters were detected for neutral face distractors suggesting regions implicated in attentional control were recruited in the presence of threatening distractors. During cognitive reappraisal of negative images compared to naturally experiencing emotions evoked by negative images (i.e., Reappraise > LookNegative), we observed recruitment of DLPFC, VLPFC, DMPFC, temporal regions, parahippocampal gyrus, and cerebellar activations. There was no evidence of an overlap in neural engagement between these emotion regulation approaches when correcting for multiple comparisons across the entire brain. Behavioral data conﬁrmed participants followed instructions as exempliﬁed by higher accuracy and faster response times in the low relative to high perceptual load condition and reduced negative aﬀective state during reappraise compared to viewing negative images. Similar to neurofunctional ﬁndings, behavioral data pointed to task-dependent eﬀects as accuracy related to attentional control did not correlate with aﬀective state during cognitive reappraisal.  4.1. Neural signature of implicit regulation  Data provide partial support for hypotheses insofar as distinct, taskdependent mechanisms are concerned. Consistent with previous studies (Bishop et al., 2007; Bunford et al., 2017a; Wheaton et al., 2014), attentional control recruited the VMPFC extending to rACC. The VMPFC possesses heavy reciprocal connections with key emotion processing regions (e.g., the amygdala; (Sergerie et al., 2008; Zald, 2003) as well as with the lateral cortex involved in goal-directed behavior (Vogt et al., 1992). Similarly, the rACC is strongly connected with the amygdala as well as with dorsal ACC and involved in conﬂict control, response selection, and error detection (Bush et al., 2000). Therefore, ventral  activation  during  EFIT  Fig. 1.

No signiﬁcant clusters were observed for Neutral Low > Neutral High (p > 0.05 FWE corrected).

Similarly, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association between neural activation and accuracy.  3.2.2.

Beyond frontal engagement, we observed recruitment in temporal regions, parahippocampal gyrus, and cerebellum.  Results did not change when adding the diﬀerence in self-reported negative aﬀect between Reappraise and Look-Negative conditions as a covariate and no signiﬁcant association between neural activation and diﬀerences in reported negative aﬀect were found.

In the context of negative stimuli, engagement of ventral midline regions may resolve threat interference through the integration of these two sources of information (Etkin et al., 2011b, 2006; Kanske and Kotz, 2011).  In addition to the involvement of hypothesized frontal regions, we also found evidence of the IPL and PCC recruitment during attentional control. The IPL plays a role in maintaining attention as well as responding to new, salient information speciﬁc to visual stimuli (SinghCurry and Husain, 2009). Its involvement in implicit regulation in the present study likely suggests engagement in general attention processes and/or response to face distractors. In contrast, the involvement of the PCC in the context of implicit regulation is diﬃcult to discern given that the function of the region in general is not entirely clear (Pearson et al., 2011). Nevertheless, involvement of the PCC in the context of emotion processing is in line with prior reports that the PCC is activated in response to emotional content (Maddock et al., 2003), and speciﬁcally in response to negative stimuli in comparison to neutral stimuli (Maddock et al., 2003). The co-activation of the PCC and rACC in the present study is particularly interesting in light of prior work demonstrating that the PCC is connected with the rACC (Cole et al., 2010). Both regions are also a part of the default mode network (DMN), a network of brain regions that are engaged during internally-directed focus (Raichle et al., 2001). The PCC is also a hub that interacts with attentional focus and arousal (Leech and Sharp, 2014). Accordingly, its activation may be tied to identifying target letters in the context of distractors or the state of arousal that results from engaging in a challenging cognitive task (i.e., attempting to respond both accurately and rapidly to stimuli presented for 200 ms). More research is needed to delineate the role of this region in this paradigm. Interestingly, we did not observe amygdala reactivity in the low relative to high load threat condition, which may be due to our whole-brain approach in determining signiﬁcant activation.  4.2. Neural signature of explicit regulation  With regard to explicit regulation, we observed engagement of the DLPFC, VLPFC, and DMPFC during cognitive reappraisal, which replicates prior reports (Buhle et al., 2014; Kanske et al., 2011; Messina et al., 2015; Ochsner et al., 2012). The DLPFC is involved in executive  6  functioning broadly-deﬁned, and is implicated in working memory (Arnsten and Jin, 2014), decision making (Lee et al., 2012), attentional control (Brosnan and Wiegand, 2017), and response selection (Yamagishi et al., 2016). Given these functions, DLPFC's role may be described as the active generation of strategies in order to execute goaldirected behavior (Corbetta et al., 2008; Corbetta and Shulman, 2002). In contrast, the VLPFC is involved in semantic processing (Marumo et al., 2014), categorization of objects (Corbetta et al., 2008; Corbetta and Shulman, 2002), and memory for semantic information (Nozari and Thompson-Schill, 2016). During emotion regulation, the VLPFC is also implicated in the generation of inner speech (Geva et al., 2011; Jones and Fernyhough, 2007; Morin and Hamper, 2012), which is believed to aid in the categorization of emotions (Kohn et al., 2014). The joint recruitment of DLPFC and VLPFC during cognitive reappraisal may represent the involvement of joint processes of emotional appraisal (sub-served by VLPFC) and reappraisal through the selection of an alternative emotional meaning (sub-served by DLPFC) to a negative image. With regard to DMPFC activation during cognitive reappraisal (Buhle et al., 2014; Diekhof et al., 2011; Kalisch, 2009), this region is thought to monitor changing emotional states, a feature of reappraisal (Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Ochsner et al., 2012).  Beyond these regions, we observed reappraisal-related activation in various structures spanning temporal and cerebellar regions, which is consistent with evidence that reappraisal relies on a widely distributed neural network. These regions in particular are consistent with metaanalytic work showcasing their involvement in reappraisal (Buhle et al., 2014; Kanske et al., 2011; Messina et al., 2015; Ochsner et al., 2012). The temporal cortex likely contributes to reappraisal through semantic and perceptual associations (Aggelopoulos and Rolls, 2005; Levy et al., 2004) as both processes are involved in cognitive reappraisal (Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Ochsner et al., 2012). With regard to reappraisal-related cerebellar activity, we hesitate to interpret its involvement, as the function of the cerebellum during cognitive reappraisal is not clear. Nevertheless, there is increasing recognition that the cerebellum plays a role in emotion processing (Snider and Maiti, 1976) and emotion regulation (e.g., 'cerebellar cognitive-aﬀective syndrome'; Parvizi et al., 2001; Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998). Therefore, its known function as a regulator of motor behavior (Bastian et al., 1999) may extend to functions involved in reappraisal (Sacchetti et al., 2009).  J.M. Fitzgerald et al.  Neuropsychologia xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx  4.3. Relationship between implicit and explicit regulation  Counter to expected results, there was no overlap in neural activity in regions involved in implicit and explicit emotion regulation. While surprising, evidence that neural involvement across the two tasks was spatially discrete is in line with some prior work that assessed overlap in brain regions involved in distraction (i.e., working memory task during the viewing of negative stimuli) and cognitive reappraisal (Dörfel et al., 2014). In this prior work, although similar brain regions were recruited in both regulation strategies (e.g., insula), a conjunction analysis failed to ﬁnd spatially-similar activation using a whole-brain FWE-corrected threshold. In contrast, another study found similar VLPFC, DLPFC, and DMPFC engagement between implicit regulation via aﬀect-labeling and cognitive reappraisal (Burklund et al., 2017), whereas a meta-analysis found overlap in the insula, pre- supplementary motor area (SMA), and VLPFC in assessing distraction by various means and aﬀect-labeling as implicit strategies alongside reappraisal, expressive suppression, and mindfulness (Morawetz et al., 2017). Based on this work, results are mixed in terms of whether there is neural overlap between implicit and explicit regulation strategies. Studies that do ﬁnd overlap highlight the involvement of several regions spanning the prefrontal cortex and insula in both strategies.  Inconsistencies among studies may be driven by the way in which implicit regulation is diﬀerentially operationalized, although the employment of cognitive reappraisal is relatively uniform. Implicit regulation is an umbrella term that includes attentional control, distraction, aﬀect labeling, reinforcer reevaluation, and extinction (Braunstein et al., 2017). In the present study, attentional control was manipulated by perceptual load, a form of implicit regulation that may not be comparable to other implicit regulation strategies (e.g., aﬀect-labeling, distraction by means of working memory). Also, diﬀerences in regulation approaches include the extent to which participants were made aware of emotional content. For example, in previous studies participants were instructed that they would be viewing negative images and engaging in implicit regulation via distraction or aﬀect-labeling (Burklund et al., 2017; Dörfel et al., 2014). In contrast, participants in our study were not told that face distractors conveyed emotional meaning. Appraising emotional content prior to regulation may alter the engagement of speciﬁc brain regions. Speciﬁcally, the insula, MPFC, and VLPFC are involved in emotional appraisal, in addition to emotion regulation. The insula is involved in interoceptive awareness of emotional states (Craig, 2009; Xu et al., 2016), while the MPFC is involved in evaluating one's own emotional experience and is activated to a greater extent during self-focused emotional monitoring (Ochsner et al., 2004). In addition, the VLPFC plays a role in semantic processing and action inhibition of emotional states, the former of which involves the appraisal of emotion (Kohn et al., 2014). Therefore, these regions are involved both in appraising and regulating emotions. Their shared involvement in distraction (e.g., when rehearsing a 9-digit number during the viewing of negative stimuli; Dörfel et al., 2014), aﬀect-labeling and cognitive reappraisal in previous work may be due to the fact that these tasks made emotional content explicit. However, more work is needed on this topic. In particular, one of these prior studies found overlap between distraction/aﬀect-labeling and reappraisal in the DLPFC, a region involved more in regulation than emotional processing (Golkar et al., 2012). Therefore, future studies are needed to precisely parse-out the contribution of appraisal-related neural activation.  In addition, these prior studies tested implicit and explicit regulation strategies within the same task design, requiring participants to switch between strategies within a shorter timeframe (e.g., on the order of seconds). In contrast, two separate tasks of attentional control and cognitive reappraisal were utilized in the current study. As a result, this approach gave participants a period of rest between the collection of fMRI signal speciﬁc to implicit and explicit strategies and did not require participants to switch between strategies. Temporal lag and dissociation of tasks may have reduced carryover eﬀects. Relatedly, there  may be individual diﬀerences with regard to whether participants are able to eﬀectively switch strategies within short timeframes (e.g., on the order of seconds) which may contribute to the sustained use of one strategy over another, even when instructed to switch. In particular, prior behavioral studies have found individual diﬀerences in the ability to switch between distraction and reappraisal (e.g., dynamic emotion regulation) (Birk and Bonanno, 2016). As a result, controlling for the ability to switch strategies is an important consideration for future studies mapping distinct versus shared neural networks of regulation. To note, distinct neurocircuitries of implicit and explicit regulation is supported by prior work. That is, prior reports qualify that these two regulation strategies are dissimilar in terms of eﬀort, time course, and eﬃciency (Gyurak et al., 2011). In terms of the separation of neural substrates, prior work emphasizes the role of the VMPFC/rACC in regulation of aﬀective experiences, in contrast to dorsal regions (e.g., DMPFC) playing a stronger role in the evaluation of stimuli (Etkin et al., 2011b). That we found VMPFC/rACC involvement during implicit regulation, but DMPFC involvement in explicit regulation ﬁts with this framework, as the cognitive reappraisal process inherently involves appraisal of emotional state for reinterpretation purposes. In contrast, implicit regulation in the form of attentional control over emotional distractors does not likely involve appraisal, but rather, quick management of competing stimuli that demand conﬂict resolution.  4.4. Study limitations  Findings from the present study should be considered in light of important limitations. First, implicit emotion regulation was studied with an emotional interference task that varied in perceptual load and cognitive reappraisal was used to examine explicit emotion regulation. Also, participants were given examples of cognitive approaches that provided alternative paths to cognitive change to aid in clarifying what was meant by ‘reappraisal’. These factors may reduce generalizability. Second, while these tasks were validated across diﬀerent laboratories, a limitation of this approach is the use of diﬀerent task stimuli and experimental design. In other words, faces were used for implicit regulation in a mixed/block event-related design (i.e., EFIT) and images were used for explicit regulation in a block design (i.e., ERT). Furthermore, the duration of these stimuli diﬀered due to diﬀerences in the function of the task. For example, the brief presentation of stringplus-face stimuli in EFIT (200 ms) is in line with automaticity, a component of implicit regulation (Gross and Thompson, 2007); moreover, the short stimulus duration reduces the potential of shifting of attention from one location to another. Yet, the duration of stimuli in EFIT would likely be too brief for reappraisal, an eﬀortful, cognitive strategy involving various executive functions. Therefore, a failure to detect signiﬁcant overlap in the spatial distribution of brain activation during these forms of emotion regulation may be the consequence of diﬀerences between paradigms. Another factor that may have reduced our ability to identify shared mechanisms is the use of a stringent wholebrain threshold, which diﬀers in approach from prior work (Burklund et al., 2017). What constitutes signiﬁcant neural activity in fMRI research is on-going (Eklund et al., 2016; Woo et al., 2014) and in lieu of a gold standard criterion, we followed current guidelines (Woo et al., 2014) to protect against Type I error, which may be overly conservative (Lieberman and Cunningham, 2009). Lastly, results are based on healthy participants, therefore, ﬁndings may not generalize to a clinical population.  5. Conclusions  Despite these limitations, results from this work provide support for distinct neural circuits characterized by VMPFC in the context of implicit emotion regulation and DLPFC, VLPFC, and DMPFC in the context of explicit emotion regulation. The uniqueness of these neural circuits is also supported by behavioral data as no relationship between accuracy  7  J.M. Fitzgerald et al.

Prosocial sentiments, which include guilt, pity and embarrassment, enable us to care about others and to be concerned about our mistakes. Functional imaging studies have implicated frontopolar, ventromedial frontal and basal forebrain regions in the experience of prosocial sentiments. Patients with lesions of the frontopolar and ventromedial frontal areas were observed to behave inappropriately and less prosocially, which could be attributed to a generalized emotional blunting. Direct experimental evidence for brain regions distinctively associated with moral sentiment impairments is lacking, however. We investigated this issue in patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, a disorder in which early and selective impairments of social conduct are consistently observed. Using a novel moral sentiment task, we show that the degree of impairment of prosocial sentiments is associated with the degree of damage to frontopolar cortex and septal area, as assessed with 18-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose-Positron Emission Tomography, an established measure of neurodegenerative damage. This effect was dissociable from impairment of other-critical feelings (anger and disgust), which was in turn associated with dorsomedial prefrontal and amygdala dysfunction. Our ﬁndings suggest a critical role of the frontopolar cortex and septal region in enabling prosocial sentiments, a fundamental component of moral conscience. Published by Elsevier Inc.  Moral sentiments are vital ingredients of moral conscience (Smith, 1759/1966; Frank, 1988). Guilt, pity, and embarrassment, in particular, are known as prosocial sentiments because they induce people to seek forgiveness following misbehavior, to comfort those who suffer and to abide to social standards (Eisenberg, 2000) (see Supplementary Information). The dominant role of prosocial sentiments is vividly illustrated by Hamlet, who ponders whether it would be preferable to die (“not to be”) than to live (“to be”) with his guilty conscience after committing a murder (“to bear the whips and scorns of time”; Shakespeare's Hamlet, Act III, Sc. I).  Clinical observations suggest that damage to several brain regions, including ventral medial and polar sectors of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Eslinger and Damasio, 1985; Koenigs et al., 2007), the anterior temporal lobes (Edwards-Lee et al., 1997; Mendez, 2006; Rankin et al.,  ⁎ Corresponding author.

Published by Elsevier Inc. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.026  2006) and basal forebrain, including the septal area (Moll et al., 2005b), may lead to impairments of moral judgment and conduct. However, direct evidence for the neuroanatomical bases of prosocial sentiments in patients with brain lesions is scarce, and very few studies have employed stimulus–response tests in this context (e.g., Krajbich et al., 2009). Inferences about impaired prosocial sentiments have relied on behavioral questionnaires, caregiver ratings, and qualitative observations, which are heavily inﬂuenced by the expectations of observers and by the frequency of socially inappropriate behavior during daily activities. Most importantly, studies using caregiver ratings of prosocial sentiments have not reported whether these were impaired relatively to other feelings. Therefore, the purported prosocial impairment in such cases has been interpreted as due to a general (i.e., nonspeciﬁc) emotional blunting (Bechara et al., 2000). Naturally, impaired prosocial feelings, as compared to impaired other-critical feelings (e.g., anger, disgust), should be expected to cause severe antisocial behaviors.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in healthy participants have implicated ventral and dorsal sectors of the PFC and the temporal lobes, as well as the amygdala, anterior insula and other  1736  J. Moll et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1735–1742  subcortical regions, in interpersonal and emotional contexts associated with autonomic arousal, mental state inference, empathic responses and self-other distinction (Berthoz et al., 2006; Carr et al., 2003; Critchley et al., 2004; Decety et al., 2004; Ochsner et al., 2004; Singer et al., 2004; Lamm et al., 2007). Studies speciﬁcally addressing prosocial feelings and behaviors have implicated the medial frontopolar cortex (FPC) and subgenual cortex, as well as the superior temporal sulcus (STS) region and the ventral striatum, septal/basal forebrain area and hypothalamus. These investigations employed different study designs, including social scenarios evocative of guilt, pity and embarrassment (Berthoz et al., 2002; Moll et al., 2002, 2007; Takahashi et al., 2004; Zahn et al., 2009c), charitable donations (Harbaugh et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2008; Moll et al., 2006), and economic decisions involving regret, trust and cooperation (Coricelli et al., 2005; Krueger et al., 2007a; Rilling et al., 2002). In contrast, stimuli linked to social and object aversion, such as injustice and gore, typically evoke other-critical feelings (contempt, anger, disgust) (Haidt, 2003; Rozin et al., 1999). Other-critical feelings tend to promote interpersonal aggression and social disengagement (Moll and Schulkin, 2009), and their anatomical bases are more wellestablished; regions consistently associated with other-critical feelings include the dorsomedial (dmPFC) and lateral sectors of the PFC [especially the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the adjoining agranular insula) and the amygdala (Buckholtz et al., 2008; Decety et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2006; Moll et al., 2005a, 2007). However, because functional individuals are unsuitable to identify which brain regions are necessary for a given cognitive ability (Price et al., 1999), studies in patients with brain lesions are indispensable for establishing which brain regions are necessary for representing prosocial and other-critical sentiments.  imaging studies in normal  We investigated the neural basis of impaired prosocial and othercritical sentiments in 21 patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and 30 normal controls with a novel experimental test (the Moral Sentiment Task) and resting-state 18-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET). BvFTD is characterized by progressive frontotemporal neurodegeneration and early social impairments (Neary et al., 1998). Inappropriate social behavior and feelings in patients with bvFTD have been associated with ventral, dorsomedial frontal and anterior temporal lobe atrophy (Liu et al., 2004; Rosen et al., 2005; Snowden et al., 2001; Williams et al, 2005). BvFTD offers a unique opportunity to investigate which regions are speciﬁc for enabling prosocial sentiments due to differences in regional distribution of neuropathology. We hypothesized that the degree of impairment of prosocial feelings would be associated with the degree of damage to frontopolar, ventral frontal and basal forebrain regions, and that these effects would be at least partially dissociable from the brain networks enabling general emotional arousal or the other-critical emotions (anger/disgust). Although both prosocial and other-critical sentiments were investigated, the main focus of the present analyses was on prosocial sentiments because (1) their neuroanatomical bases have been much less explored by both functional imaging and lesion studies, and (2) reduced prosocial feelings most likely play a crucial role in explaining callous and nonempathic behaviors in brain-damaged patients.  Materials and methods  Patients and controls  Patients were referred by specialists to participate in a larger observational study at the clinical center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intramural program in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. Thirtyone consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of bvFTD were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of bvFTD was made on the basis of clinical and neuropsychological data, as well as on visual inspection of MRI and FDG-PET, following the consensus criteria of the Lund Manchester Group (Neary et al., 1998) and the Work Group on Frontotemporal Dementia and Pick's Disease (McKhann et al., 2001). Dementia severity was assessed with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2, a reliable and valid measure of global cognitive dysfunction (Kertesz et al., 2003). Normal controls were also evaluated with the Mattis scale in order to rule out cognitive impairment. Patients stayed at NIH for 1 week and were accompanied by their main caregiver (for further details on the patient cohort see Zahn et al., 2009b). They were clinically assessed by a senior neurologist and a senior neuropsychologist (J.G.) and underwent extensive neuropsychological testing as well as MRI and resting FDG-PET. General inclusion criteria were strong right-handedness and English as ﬁrst language. The leading symptoms of bvFTD were progressive behavioral abnormalities with an early loss of insight as noted by caregivers. All patients showed abnormalities within frontotemporal areas on visual inspection of FDG-PET, MRI, or both. Substance abuse was ruled out by a negative history antedating the onset of the behavioral changes and by close monitoring over the 1-week period of the study. Ten patients were excluded prior to statistical analysis due to technical problems with imaging (n=8) or MST (n=2) data. The ﬁnal bvFTD sample therefore included 15 men and 6 women (age = 60.6 ± 8.0 years; education=15.4±3.2 years). Thirty age- and education-matched volunteers (15 men) served as controls for standardization of the MST (age: 61.5±8.5 years; education: 16.9±2.6 years). FDG-PET scans were obtained from 12 controls matched in gender, age and education. All controls had a normal neurological examination and no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. Controls were compensated for participation according to NIH standards. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants according to the NINDS Institutional Review Board procedures.  Moral sentiment task  The MST (obtainable from the ﬁrst author [jorge.moll@idor.org] upon request) was designed as a self-paced computerized test programmed on Experimental Run Time System (Berisoft Cooperation, Germany, http://www.erts.de). Ninety-eight written scenarios (“stimuli”) were presented, one at a time, at the top of a screen for participants to decide which of four words at the bottom (choice options) best described the feeling they would experience in that given situation. Each stimulus was associated with a “target”, based on normative data from controls. Targets included the following classes of sentiments: guilt, pity and embarrassment (prosocial sentiments), anger and disgust (other-critical sentiments), fear, and neutral (Fig. 1). A previous study on moral sentiments showed these stimuli to be powerful elicitors of experienced moral sentiments (Moll et al., 2007). Non-target feelings belonged to the same list of targets. All items were presented in ﬁxed randomized order (14 stimuli for each sentiment plus 14 neutral stimuli). Colors and positions were counterbalanced across the different sentiments. A NEUTRAL tag was present in each trial as one of the four options. Instructions for the MST are provided in the Supplementary Methods.  The accuracy of each stimulus category was assessed with an index score which penalized scores for a given category in case of omission or commission “errors” (these errors are statistical deviations from the healthy control group norm, being otherwise compatible with a patient's subjective experience). To that aim, we ﬁrst computed the number of correct choices for a given category (e.g., number of times “GUILT” was assigned to a scenario that is known to be consistently associated with guilt in controls) and then weighted this result by the inverse of the number of times that same option was assigned to a wrong category (e.g., number of times GUILT was erroneously associated with a scenario belonging to a different class) plus one (to avoid division by zero). For example, if a participant chose GUILT appropriately in 12 out of the 14 guilt scenarios, and mistakenly chose GUILT instead of the correct target in two other scenario categories, her  J.

Participants viewed 98 social scenarios on the screen, together with response options: the target (correct choice, based on normative data) and three non-targets (“distracters”). They were told to report what they would feel in each given situation. A ﬁxed color coding of keyboard keys and response options helped to minimize task-related visuomotor load. The position of the target word option was randomized across trials. The neutral option (with equal frequency as the other options) was present in all trials. Any given word could be the target on each trial with equal probability. The scenario examples do not include samples from all experimental conditions.  score would be 12/(2+1)=4. These raw scores were z-normalized for the whole sample (21 bvFTD patients and 30 controls). The normalized scores for guilt, pity and embarrassment were averaged to generate a composite prosocial sentiment score for each subject. Normalized scores for anger and disgust were averaged to generate a composite other-critical score for each subject. This was done to increase the power of the measures, based on psychological and functional imaging evidence that prosocial and other-critical sentiments rely on partially separate neural networks, which are nonetheless consistent among feelings belonging to each of these categories (Moll et al., 2007). Fear was left out of the analyses because (1) fearful stimuli in our task did not invoke social fear, (2) current theoretical models of other-critical emotions include anger and disgust (Haidt, 2003; Rozin et al., 1999), and (3) we had previous evidence from social script studies linking the neural representations of anger and disgust, but not fear (Moll et al., 2005a,b, 2007). Mean number of words and characters per statement were equivalent for the prosocial and other-critical categories (respectively: mean word t = −0.14, p = 0.89; mean character count = 20.0 vs. 20.1, count= 83.9 vs. 84.8, t=−1.01, p =0.31). Mean correct category assignment of social scenarios by controls (0.89±0.12) was similar to our previous study on normal controls (Moll et al., 2007). Controls scored the prosocial and other-critical categories with comparable accuracy, indicating that these categories were matched in difﬁculty (t=0.36, p =0.74).  Behavioral data analysis  Neuropsychological data were analyzed with SPSS v. 16 (www. spss.com) and R v. 2.8.0 (www.r-project.org). The z-normalized scores on prosocial and other-critical sentiments from patients and controls were assessed by Welch t-tests, with the alpha level set to p = 0.05. All variables were assessed for multicollinearity (see Supplementary Methods). Two-tailed signiﬁcances were adopted for all analyses. Clinical and behavioral symptoms were assessed with standard instruments (for further details, see Zahn et al., 2009b).  Image acquisition and analysis  Image acquisition  Structural MR imaging was performed on a General Electric 1.5 Tesla scanner (3D-T1-SPGR sequence, 120 contiguous slices, slice thickness=1.5 mm, in-plane resolution=0.9375 mm×0.9375 mm, ﬂip angle=20°). All FDG-PET scans were acquired with a GE Advance PET Scanner. Subjects were fasting since midnight before the scan and had no caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine for 24 h before the scan. An arterial line was inserted for arterial blood sampling. The subjects were given an intravenous injection of 5 millicuries of FDG while they wore eye patches and ear plugs. Starting with the time of injection and continuing through the cerebral uptake period and subsequent scan, 25 arterial blood specimens were taken at ﬁxed intervals for assay of plasma radioactivity and glucose content. A transmission scan was used to correct the emission data. At the end of the 45-min uptake period, the emission PET scan was performed (15 min for one set of 35 brain slices).  Imaging analysis  Imaging data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5, http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5). The following pre-processing steps were applied: normalization with 2×2× 2 mm (8 mm3) voxel size and smoothing (FWHM=12 mm). Normalization was performed by ﬁrst normalizing the 3D MRI using the SPM5 T1- template and then applying the same transformation to the FDG-PET images. Global normalization was performed using cerebellar metabolism as a scaling factor. Three statistical models were used to assess inter-group and intra-group PET metabolism differences. In the ﬁrst model, bvFTD and controls were entered as categorical variables and t-tests were used to compare the regional metabolism between groups (voxel-level signiﬁcance threshold: p b0.001, uncorrected). This statistical map was used as an inclusive mask for the subsequent parametric analysis, to minimize the number of comparisons over the whole brain. The second model (parametric) employed multiple regression (SPM5 design matrix) to probe the association between regional cerebral metabolism in bvFTD with  1738  J. Moll et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1735–1742  (i) prosocial scores (adjusting for other-critical and dementia severity scores) and (ii) other-critical scores (adjusting for prosocial and dementia severity scores). The relationship between metabolism and the combined (additive) effects of prosocial and other-critical scores was also investigated (see Supplementary Results). An additional analysis explored the correlations between FPC and septal metabolism with guilt, pity and embarrassment separately, controlling for dementia severity.  We report only areas surviving a family-wise error (FWE) corrected threshold of p=0.05 either across the whole brain or across the following regions of interest deﬁned a priori on the basis of coordinates from previous studies and used as the center of spheres (see Supplementary Methods for details on the regions of interest). For the purpose of visual displays only, a threshold of p=0.05, uncorrected, and a cluster threshold=20 voxels was employed.  Anatomical localization  Localization was performed using anatomical landmarks and by looking at activations in the Montreal Neurological Imaging (MNI) space projected onto a standard MNI template. Talairach transformed coordinates using Brett's formula (http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/ Imaging /common/mnispace.shtml) were used to identify corresponding Brodmann areas (BA) using the Talairach Daemon software version 2 (http://ric.uthscsa.edu/projects/ talairachdaemon.html). All coordinates are in Montreal Neurological Institute Standard Space. MRIcron (http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricron/) was used to display statistical masks overlaid on a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI template (Rorden and Brett, 2000).  Results  Behavioral results  As expected, bvFTD patients showed pronouncedly reduced prosocial sentiment scores as compared with controls (mean± standard deviation (SD): −0.76 ± 0.82 vs. 0.52 ± 0.49, t = 6.4, p b0.000001; Fig. 2a). Patients also showed reduced other-critical scores (combined anger and disgust scores) compared with controls (−0.54±0.61 vs. 0.47±0.71, t=5.4, p b0.00001; Fig. 2b). These results indicate that, as a group, patients were markedly impaired both on prosocial and other-critical sentiments.  lism) would be parametrically associated with impaired performance on the MST within the bvFTD group. For this purpose, a multiple regression design was ﬁrst employed within the patient group to explore the effects of regional hypometabolism on prosocial sentiment impairment, controlling for other-critical scores and dementia severity. Lower scores on prosocial sentiments were associated with hypometabolism in the medial FPC [Brodmann's area (BA) 10], mainly in the right hemisphere, and in the septal area (Fig. 3a, b and Table 1), supporting the prediction that these regions are necessary and selective for prosocial sentiments.  One related issue is whether the above brain regions are equally important for guilt, pity and embarrassment, as emphasized by recent fMRI studies (Moll et al., 2007). As a further differentiation of the PFC, the FPC performs an important role in the prospective assessments and valuation of social choices (Christoff and Gabrieli, 2000; Moll et al., 2007), key abilities for the successful engagement of prosocial behaviors (Moll et al., 2006). The septal area, in turn, is believed to be involved in social attachment and empathic concern for others (Insel and Young, 2001; Moll et al., 2006), which are important for feelings of guilt and pity, but not for embarrassment, a prosocial sentiment that it is associated with concerns about one's own self-image related to violations of social conventions (Einsenberg, 2000). This aspect was investigated by computing the correlations between FPC and septal metabolism with guilt, pity and embarrassment separately, controlling for dementia severity. Individual scores on each of these three sentiments were signiﬁcantly correlated with the degree of FPC hypometabolism. Hypometabolism in the septal area was signiﬁcantly correlated with impaired guilt and pity, but not with embarrassment (Fig. 3c).  Next, the relationship between brain hypometabolism and othercritical sentiments were explored with multiple regression, entering prosocial scores and dementia severity as control variables. Lower other-critical scores were associated with reduced metabolism in two predicted frontal and limbic regions, the dmPFC (mainly in the right hemisphere; BA 8/9; p = 0.016, FWE-corrected) and the right amygdala (p =0.022, FWE-corrected) (Fig. 4, Table 1). Hypometabolism in the lateral OFC / anterior insula correlated both with othercritical and prosocial scores (Supplementary Fig. 2). These effects support the notion that the dmPFC and amygdala play an important role in social aversion (Buckholtz et al., 2008; Decety et al., 2004; Moll et al., 2005a; Sanfey et al., 2003).  Neuroimaging results  Discussion  Patients showed the expected frontotemporal and subcortical hypometabolism in comparison to controls (see supplementary information). However, our main analyses aimed at exploring whether regional brain dysfunction (FDG-PET regional hypometabo The main ﬁnding of this investigation was that the resting PET hypometabolism, a sensitive marker of neurodegeneration (Kanda et al., 2008), in the medial FPC and in the septal area was associated with the level of prosocial sentiment impairment in patients with  Fig. 2.

The speciﬁc role of the FPC and septal area in this regard was further corroborated by the ﬁnding that decreased other-critical scores resulted from hypometabolism in distinct PFC and subcortical regions, namely the dmPFC and the right amygdala.

Prosocial effects were evaluated by entering prosocial scores as the variable of interest, and othercritical and dementia scores as covariates. Other-critical effects were evaluated by entering other-critical scores as the variable of interest, and prosocial and dementia scores as covariates. Results of FWE-correction over a priori regions of interest deﬁned on the basis of previous studies are reported (see Materials and methods).  The role of the frontopolar cortex in prosocial sentiments  The role of FPC in social cognition has received growing attention (Christoff and Gabrieli, 2000; Heekeren et al., 2003; Greene et al., 2004; Wood and Grafman, 2003; Krueger et al., 2007b; Young et al., 2007). Remarkably, virtually all fMRI studies addressing neural responses to moral judgments (Moll et al., 2005b) and to social scenarios evocative of guilt, pity and embarrassment (Moll et al., 2007; Zahn et al., 2009c) found medial FPC activation. Furthermore, the FPC has been implicated in decisions involving costly punishment (de Quervain et al., 2004) and donation (Moll et al., 2006), as well as in inferring the emotional states of others (Amodio and Frith, 2006). Although the FPC is often affected in cases of vmPFC damage (Eslinger and Damasio, 1985; Koenigs and Tranel, 2007), few lesion studies investigated its role in the genesis of social and emotional impairments (Hornak et al., 2003; Moll and de Oliveira-Souza, 2007). A recent study on a similar patient group indicated reduced behavioral responses to embarrassment, but not to startle (Sturm et al., 2006). In addition, another recent study engaged six patients with vmPFC lesions in different economic decision tasks (dictator, ultimatum and trust games) and demonstrated that, relative to control subjects, they donated less, were less trustworthy and relatively insensitive to guilt  1740  J. Moll et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1735–1742  Fig. 4. (a) Areas of PET hypometabolism associated with reduced other-critical sentiments (adjusted for dementia severity and prosocial sentiments). The right amygdala and the dmPFC were the only regions surviving FWE-corrected p =0.05 over the whole-brain or a priori ROIs. Statistical maps are overlaid onto an anatomical template, with display threshold of uncorrected p b0.05, k≥20 voxels for visualization purposes. (b) Linear regression plots (not adjusted for dementia severity and prosocial sentiments) of regional PET metabolism and other-critical scores for the dmPFC (r=0.54, p=0.011) and right amygdala (r =0.50, p=0.022). These scatter plots are for the purpose of display only, and were not the basis of any inferences in this study.  (Krajbich et al., 2009). It should be emphasized that PFC lesions in Krajbich et al.'s study ranged from the vmPFC proper to the medial FPC in virtually all cases, as judged by visual inspection of the lesion overlap maps. Our study thus helps establish the FPC as an important neural component for enabling prosocial sentiments, including guilt, pity and embarrassment, and extends previous ﬁndings by improving anatomical localization of these effects within the PFC.  Social afﬁliation and the septal area  In addition to the FPC, we found a decrease in septal hypometabolism with increasing impairments on prosocial sentiments. Anatomically, the septal region contains the septum pellucidum, composed of thin layers of ﬁbrous tissue and slender fascicles, and the septum verum, a collection of eleven small nuclei located anteriorly and inferiorly to the septum pellucidum (Andy and Stephan, 1968). Contrary to the notion that limbic structures are evolutionarily ancient or vestigial in humans (MacLean, 1973), the septal nuclei may actually have increased in size and complexity during hominin phylogenesis (Andy and Stephan, 1968; Joseph, 1996). The role of the septal area in social behavior is highlighted by the fact that septal damage can produce drastic behavioral abnormalities, leading to predatory aggression and changes in sexual behavior in humans and animals (Gorman and Cummings, 1992). Stimulation of this region, in contrast, induces pleasurable experiences and decreases intraspecies aggression (Bishop et al., 1963; Irvin et al., 1990). Some researchers have proposed that septal dysfunction may underlie the lack of empathy, guilt and remorse that is typically observed in psychopathy (Gorenstein and Newman, 1980). The septal region and adjacent subgenual cingulate, preoptic and ventromedial hypothalamic areas are the main binding sites for oxytocin and vasopressin, which play central roles in social bonding (Insel and Young, 2001). Functional imaging studies looking at mother-offspring and romantic attachment, charitable donations and economic cooperation based on trust (Bartels and Zeki, 2004; Harbaugh et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2008; Krueger et al., 2007a,b; Moll et al., 2006; Mobbs et al., 2009) found activation in the septal region. The putative role of the septal area in enabling prosocial sentiments has so far remained under-recognized, however. Our ﬁnding that septal hypometabolism is associated with reduced guilt and pity supports a mutual role of the septal area and the FPC in prosocial behaviors, including empathic concern, altruism and related afﬁliative inclinations.  Previous fMRI studies implicate additional brain regions in prosocial sentiments, especially the subgenual cortex (Hsu et al., 2008; Moll et al., 2006; Zahn et al., 2009c). Our prediction that  subgenual neurodegeneration would be associated with prosocial sentiment impairment was not conﬁrmed, however. It is possible that the subgenual cortex plays a more elaborated role in prosocial sentiments, a notion supported by the role of the subgenual cortex in the pathophysiology of major depression (Drevets et al., 1998), decisions involving altruistic donations (Moll et al., 2006) and coding for individual differences in guilt-proneness and empathic concern (Zahn et al., 2009a).  Brain regions mediating other-critical feelings  In contrast to our ﬁndings regarding prosocial sentiments, hypometabolism in the right amygdala and dmPFC was associated with reduced other-critical scores. The amygdala, dmPFC (and neighboring paracingulate cortex) and lateral OFC / adjoining agranular anterior insula have been consistently implicated in imaging studies on the mechanisms of social punishment, social response reversal, racial bias, and competition (Decety et al., 2004; Kringelbach and Rolls, 2003; Lieberman et al., 2003; Moll et al., 2005a; Sanfey et al., 2003; Singer et al., 2006). A shared feature of these conditions is that they all involve some kind of external aversive signaling, inducing an agent to act upon the behavior of another agent or object (e.g., through punishment). Our data show that the right amygdala and dmPFC are necessary for appropriate other-critical sentiments.  While the role of the amygdala in other-critical sentiments is supported by several studies on social disapproval, prejudice and lack of trust (Calder et al., 2001; Lieberman et al., 2003; Sanfey et al., 2003), the theoretical basis for the association of dmPFC hypometabolism with impaired other-critical feelings is uncertain. fMRI studies found activity in this region in response to social feedback and when evaluating others, mainly when “others” are categorized as members of an out-group or dissimilar (Mitchell et al., 2006; Schiller et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2009). A recent fMRI study using scenarios similar to the ones herein employed showed a remarkable agreement with our ﬁndings: whereas the dmPFC showed increased responses to “other-anger,” the more anterior FPC responded more strongly to guilt and compassion or pity (Kédia et al., 2008). Nonetheless, lesion studies investigating the impact of dmPFC damage on moral cognition and emotion are lacking. One interesting possibility is whether othercritical sentiments could be reduced by modulating dmPFC activity, a ﬁnding that could have potential therapeutic implications for managing aggressive and antisocial behaviors.  A notable exception for the brain regions predicted to be selectively associated with other-critical scores was the lateral OFC / anterior insula.  J. Moll et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1735–1742  1741  Instead, we found that hypometabolism in this region was strongly but similarly associated with other-critical and with prosocial impairments. One possible explanation is that the lateral OFC / anterior insula are involved with more general aspects of behavioral reinforcement, response reversal and unpleasantness in social contexts, such as when observing other's pain (Decety et al., 2004; Kringelbach and Rolls, 2003; Lamm et al., 2007; Singer et al., 2006), which might be important not only for other-critical feelings but also for certain aspects of prosocial sentiments (e.g., restraining from an action that could evoke feelings of guilt or embarrassment).  Emotional dysfunction and PFC-subcortical damage  Our results did not support the alternative hypothesis that the association between FPC-septal hypometabolism and reduced prosocial sentiments emerged from an overall emotional blunting in bvFTD because this association remained robust after controlling for othercritical ratings. This is in keeping with the hypothesized role of speciﬁc PFC and subcortical sub-regions in enabling prosocial sentiments (Moll and de Oliveira-Souza, 2007). Studies on patients with rostral ventromedial lesions, which often encompass the FPC, speak for a complex interplay of emotional impairments: while these patients have an increased preference for “utilitarian” choices in moral dilemmas (Koenigs et al., 2007), indicating reduced emotionality, they show increased costly punishment of non-cooperators in an economic game (Koenigs and Tranel, 2007), suggestive of heightened emotionality. On a more cautionary note, although the observed relationships between impairments of feelings and localized metabolic dysfunction go a step beyond fMRI evidence by implying possible causal effects, these associations are still correlational in nature and future prospective studies are needed to further support causal inferences. Taken together, these results support a functional subspecialization of PFC-subcortical regions in enabling distinct aspects of prosocial and other-critical subjective emotional states and behavioral inclinations.  Conclusions  The FPC and the septal area are necessary for prosocial sentiments. These effects are likely selective because other-critical impairments seem to be associated with a distinct pattern of regional dysfunction affecting the dmPFC and the right amygdala. These ﬁndings are in line with the role of prosocial sentiments as the affective hub of moral conscience, given the prominence of their association with the FPC and the septal area—brain regions that have shown both allometric and non-allometric increases in humans (Stephan, 1983).

This form of learning is often assumed to require simulation of the other by direct recruitment of one’s own valuation process to model the other’s process. However, the cognitive and neural mechanism of simulation learning is not known. Using behavior, modeling, and fMRI, we show that simulation involves two learning signals in a hierarchical arrangement. A simulated-other’s reward prediction error processed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex mediated simulation by direct recruitment, being identical for valuation of the self and simulated-other. However, direct recruitment was insufﬁcient learning, and also required observation of the other’s choices to generate a simulated-other’s action prediction error encoded in dorsomedial/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These ﬁndings show that simulation uses a core prefrontal circuit for modeling the other’s valuation to generate prediction and an adjunct circuit for tracking behavioral variation to reﬁne prediction.  for  INTRODUCTION  A fundamental human ability in social environments is the simulation of another person’s mental states, or hidden internal variables, to predict their actions and outcomes. Indeed, the ability to simulate another is considered a basic component of mentalizing or theory of mind (Fehr and Camerer, 2007; Frith and Frith, 1999; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Sanfey, 2007). However, despite its importance for social cognition, little is known about simulation learning and its cognitive and neural mechanisms. A commonly assumed account of simulation is the direct recruitment of one’s own decision-making process to model the other’s process (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Buckner and Carroll, 2007; Mitchell, 2009). The direct recruitment hypothesis predicts that  one makes and simulates a model of how the other will act, including the other’s internal variables, as if it is one’s own process, and assumes that this simulated internal valuation process employs the same neural circuitry that one uses for one’s own process. As such, the hypothesis is parsimonious and thus attractive as a simple explanation of simulation, but it is also difﬁcult to examine experimentally and therefore lies at the heart of current debate in the social cognition literature (Adolphs, 2010; Buckner and Carroll, 2007; Keysers and Gazzola, 2007; Mitchell, 2009; Saxe, 2005). A deﬁnitive examination of this issue requires a theoretical framework that provides quantitative predictions that can be tested experimentally.  learning (RL)  We adopted a reinforcement  framework to provide a simple, rigorous account of behavior in valuating options for one’s own decision-making. RL also provides a clear model of one’s internal process using two key internal variables: value and reward prediction error. Value is the expected reward associated with available options, and is updated by feedback from a reward prediction error—the difference between the predicted and actual reward. The RL framework is supported by considerable empirical evidence including neural signals in various cortical and subcortical structures that behave as predicted (Glimcher and Rustichini, 2004; Hikosaka et al., 2006; Rangel et al., 2008; Schultz et al., 1997).  The RL framework or other parametric analyses have also been applied to studies of decision making and learning in various social contexts (Behrens et al., 2008; Bhatt et al., 2010; Coricelli and Nagel, 2009; Delgado et al., 2005; Hampton et al., 2008; Montague et al., 2006; Yoshida et al., 2010). These studies investigated how human valuation and choice differ depending on social interactions with others or different understandings of others. They typically require that subjects use high-level mentalizing, or recursive reasoning in interactive game situations where one must predict the other’s behavior and/or what they are thinking about themselves. Although important in human social behavior (Camerer et al., 2004; Singer and Lamm, 2009), this form of high-level mentalizing complicates investigation of the signals and computations of simulation and thus makes it difﬁcult to isolate its underlying brain signals.  In the present study, we exploited a basic social situation for our main task, equivalent to a ﬁrst level (and not higher level)  Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc. 1125  Simulation Learning of Others’ Decisions  Neuron  mentalizing process: subjects were required to predict the other’s choices while observing their choices and outcomes without interacting with the other. Thus, in our study, the same RL framework that is commonly used to model one’s own process provides a model to deﬁne signals and computations relevant to the other’s process. We also used a control task in which subjects were required to make their own value-based decisions. Combining these tasks allowed us to directly compare brain signals between one’s own process and the ‘‘simulated-other’s’’ process, in particular, the signals for reward prediction error in one’s own valuation (control task) and the simulated-other’s valuation (main task).  Moreover, the main task’s simple structure makes it relatively straightforward to use the RL framework to identify additional signals and computations beyond those assumed for simulation by direct recruitment. Strongly stated, the direct recruitment hypothesis assumes that the other’s process is simulated by the same cognitive and neural process as one’s own, and accordingly, in the main task, the simulation learning would be expected to use only knowledge of the other’s outcomes, while a weaker version of the hypothesis would assume only the involvement of the cognitive process. Indeed, in many social situations, one may also observe and utilize the other’s decisions or choices wherein the stronger hypothesis should be rejected. We therefore examined whether an additional, undeﬁned learning signal based on information about the other’s choices might also be used by humans to simulate the other’s valuation process.  Employing behavior, fMRI, and computational modeling, we examined the process of simulation learning, asking whether one uses reward prediction errors in the same manner that one does for self learning, and whether the same neural circuitry is recruited. We then investigated whether humans utilize signals acquired by observing variation in the other’s choices to improve learning for the simulation and prediction of the other’s choice behavior.  assigned in each trial, it was neither possible nor necessary to learn to associate speciﬁc reward magnitudes with speciﬁc stimuli. In fact, because the magnitudes ﬂuctuated across trials, subjects often chose the stimulus with the lower reward probability, even in later trials.  In the Other task, subjects also chose between two stimuli in each trial, but the aim was not to predict which stimulus would give the greatest reward, but to predict the choices made by another person (the other) who was performing the Control task displayed on a monitor (Figure 1A). Subjects were told that the other was a previous participant of the experiment, but their choices were actually generated from an RL model with a risk-neutral setting. Subjects gained a ﬁxed reward in the trial when their predicted choice matched the other’s choice; thus, to predict the other’s choices, subjects had to learn the reward probability that the other was learning over the trials.  The subjects’ choices in the Control task were well ﬁtted by a basic RL model that combined the reward probability and magnitude to compute the value of each stimulus (Equation 1 in Experimental Procedures) and to generate choice probabilities (Figure S1A available online). Given that the reward magnitude was explicitly shown in every trial, the subjects needed to learn only the reward probability. Thus, the RL model was modiﬁed such that the reward prediction error is focused on update of the reward probability (Equation 2), not of value per se, as in an earlier study employing this task (Behrens et al., 2007). The RL model correctly predicted the subjects’ choices with >90% accuracy (mean ± SEM: 0.9117 ± 0.0098) and provided a better ﬁt to the choice behavior than models using only the reward probability or magnitude to generate choices (p < 0.01, paired t test on Akaike’s Information Criterion [AIC] value distributions between the two indicated models [Figure 1D]; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Table S1 for more details), which is consistent with the earlier study (Behrens et al., 2007).  RESULTS  Behavior in Simulating the Other’s Value-Based Decisions and Making One’s Own Decisions To measure the behavior for learning to simulate the other, subjects performed two decision-making tasks, a Control task and an Other task (Figure 1A). The Other task was designed to probe the subjects’ simulation learning to predict the other’s value-based decisions, while the Control task was a reference task to probe the subjects’ own value-based decisions. In both tasks, subjects repeatedly chose between two stimuli.  In the Control task, only one stimulus was ‘‘correct’’ in each trial, and this was governed by a single reward probability, i.e., the probability p was ﬁxed throughout a block of trials, and the reward probabilities for both stimuli were given by p and 1   p, respectively. When subjects made a correct choice, they received a reward with a magnitude that was visibly assigned to the chosen stimulus. As the reward probability was unknown to them, it had to be learned over the course of the trials to maximize overall reward earnings (Behrens et al., 2007). As the reward magnitude for both stimuli was randomly but visibly  1126 Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc.  To compare the subjects’ learning of the reward probability in the Control and Other tasks, we plotted the percentage (averaged across all subjects) of times that the stimulus with the higher reward probability was chosen over the course of the trials (Figure 1B, left) and averaged over all trials (Figure 1B, right). During the Control task, subjects learned the reward probability associated with the stimulus and employed a risk-averse strategy. The percentage of times that the stimulus with the higher reward probability was chosen gradually increased during the early trials (Figure 1B, left, blue curve), demonstrating that subjects learned the stimulus reward probability. The average percentage of all trials in which the higher-probability stimulus was chosen (Figure 1B, right, ﬁlled blue circle) was signiﬁcantly higher than the reward probability associated with that stimulus (Figure 1B, right, dashed line; p < 0.01, two-tailed t test). This ﬁnding suggests that subjects engaged in risk-averse behavior, i.e., choosing the stimulus more often than they should if they were behaving optimally or in a risk-neutral manner. Indeed, in terms of the ﬁt of the RL model (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), the majority of subjects (23/36 subjects) employed risk-averse behavior risk-prone behavior.  than risk-neutral or  rather  Neuron  Simulation Learning of Others’ Decisions  Figure 1. Experimental Tasks and Behavioral Results (A) Illustration of the experimental tasks: Control (left) and Other (right). In both tasks, each trial consisted of four phases: CUE, RESPONSE, INTERSTIMULUS INTERVAL (ISI), and OUTCOME. For every trial in both tasks, subjects chose between two fractal stimuli, and the stimulus chosen by the subject (RESPONSE) was indicated by a gray frame during the ISI. In the Control task, the ‘‘correct’’ (rewarded) stimulus of the subject was revealed in the center (OUTCOME). In the Other task, the rewarded stimulus of the other was indicated in the center, and the other’s choice was indicated by a red frame. (B) Mean percentages of choosing the stimulus with the higher reward probability (across subjects; n = 36) are shown as curves across trials (left; shaded regions indicate the SEM) and as the averages (±SEM) of all trials (right) for the subjects’ choices in the Control (blue) and Other (red) tasks and the others’ choices in the Other task (black). These curves were obtained by smoothing each individual’s choices with a Gaussian ﬁlter (1.25 trials) and then averaging the results for all subjects. The dotted line on the right indicates the stimulus reward probability (75%). Asterisks above the horizontal lines indicate signiﬁcant differences between the indicated means (**p < 0.01; two-tailed paired t test; n.s., nonsigniﬁcant as p > 0.05), and asterisks at each point indicate signiﬁcant differences from the stimulus reward probability (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, two-tailed t test; n.s., nonsigniﬁcant as p > 0.05). Here, we note that the mean percentages of choosing the stimulus with the higher reward probability for the subject and the other in the Other task were slightly lower than the reward probability associated with the stimulus reward probability (subjects: p = 0.096; other: p < 0.05, two-tailed t test), which is reasonable given that the averaging included the early trials when learning was still ongoing. (C) Similar data averaged across all trials in a separate experiment (error bars = ± SEM). The two Other task conditions, Other I and Other II, correspond to the other’s choices modeled by the RL model using risk-neutral and risk-averse parameters, respectively. **p < 0.01, signiﬁcant differences between the indicated pairs of data (two-tailed paired t test.); n.s., nonsigniﬁcant (p > 0.05). (D) Models’ ﬁt to behaviors in the Control (left) and Other (right) tasks. Each bar (±SEM) indicates the log likelihood of each model, averaged over subjects and normalized by the number of trials (thus, a larger magnitude indicates a better ﬁt to behavior). **p < 0.01, difference in AIC values between the two indicated models (one-tailed paired t test over the AIC distributions). The MG, PR, and RL models in the Control task are the RL model using reward magnitude only, reward probability only, and both, respectively, to generate choices. In the Other task, S-free RL is a simulation-free RL, and S-RLsAPE, S-RLsRPE, and S-RLsRPE+sAPE are Simulation-RL models using sAPE error only, sRPE only, and both sRPE and sAPE, respectively.  In the Other task, subjects tracked the choice behavior of the other. The percentage of times that the stimulus with the higher reward probability was chosen by the subjects (Figure 1B, left, red curve) appeared to follow the percentage of times that the stimulus was chosen by the other (Figure 1B, left, black curve). This behavior differed from that of the Control task in that the percentage increased over trials but did so more gradually and plateaued at a level below that in the Control task. Indeed, the average percentage of times that the stimulus with the higher  reward probability was chosen by the subjects in the Other task (Figure 1B, right, ﬁlled red circle) was not signiﬁcantly different (p > 0.05, two-tailed paired t test) from that chosen by the other (Figure 1B, right, ﬁlled black circle), but was signiﬁcantly lower than that chosen by the subjects in the Control task (p < 0.01, two-tailed paired t test). Given that the other’s choices were modeled using an RL model with a risk-neutral setting, the subjects’ choices in the Other task indicate that they were not using risk-averse behavior as they did in the  Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc. 1127  Simulation Learning of Others’ Decisions  Neuron  lating the other’s value-based decision making to the behavioral data. The general form of these ‘‘simulation-based’’ RL models was that subjects learned the simulated-other’s reward probability by simulating the other’s decision making process. At the time of decision, subjects used the simulated-other’s values (the simulated-other’s reward probability multiplied by the given reward magnitude) to generate the simulated-other’s choice probability, and from this, they could generate their own option value and choice. As discussed earlier, there are two potential sources of information for subjects to learn about the other’s decisions, i.e., the other’s outcomes and choices.  If subjects applied only their own value-based decision making process to simulate the other’s decisions, they would update their simulation using the other’s outcomes; they would update the simulated-other’s reward probability according to the difference between the other’s actual outcome and the simulated-other’s reward probability. We termed this difference the ‘‘simulated-other’s reward prediction error’’ (sRPE; Equation 4). However, subjects may also use the other’s choices to facilitate their learning of the other’s process. That is, subjects may also use the discrepancy in their prediction of the other’s choices from their actual choices to update their simulation. We termed the difference between the other’s choices and the simulatedother’s choice probability the ‘‘simulated-other’s action prediction error’’ (sAPE; Equation 6). In particular, we modeled the sAPE signal as a signal comparable to the sRPE, with the two being combined (i.e., multiplied by the respective learning rates and then added together; Equation 3) to update the simulatedother’s reward probability (see Figure S1A for a schematic diagram of the hypothesized computational processes). Computationally, this is achieved such that the sAPE is obtained by transforming the action prediction error that was generated ﬁrst at the ‘‘action’’ level (as the difference between the other’s choice and the simulated-other’s choice probability [Equation 5; Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more details]) back into the value level.  With these considerations, we examined three simulationbased RL models that learned the simulated-other’s reward probability: a model using the sRPE and sAPE (SimulationRLsRPE+sAPE), a model using only the sRPE (Simulation-RLsRPE), and a model using only the sAPE (Simulation-RLsAPE). As part of the comparison, we also examined the simulation-free RL model mentioned above.  By ﬁtting each of these computational models separately to the behavioral data and comparing their goodness of ﬁt (Figure 1D; Table S1 for parameter estimates and pseudo-R2 of each model), we determined that the Simulation-RLsRPE+sAPE model provided the best ﬁt to the data. First, all three Simulation-RL models ﬁtted the actual behavior signiﬁcantly better than the simulation-free RL model (p < 0.0001, one-tailed paired t test over the distributions of AIC values across subjects). This broadly supports the notion that subjects took account of and internally simulated the other’s decision-making processes in the Simulation-RLsRPE+sAPE model the Other task. Second, (S-RLsRPE+sAPE model hereafter) ﬁtted the behavior signiﬁcantly better than the Simulation-RL models using either of the prediction errors alone (p < 0.01, one-tailed paired t test over the AIC distributions; Figure 1D). This observation was also supported  Control task but were behaving similarly to the other. Together, these results suggest that the subjects were learning to simulate the other’s value-based decision making.  Alternative interpretations, however, might also be possible. For example, despite the task instruction to predict the other’s choices, the subjects might have completely ignored the other’s outcomes and choices and focused instead only on their own outcomes. In this scenario, they might have performed the Other task in the same way as they did the Control task, considering the red frame in the OUTCOME phase (Figure 1A) not as the other’s choice, as instructed, but as the ‘‘correct’’ stimulus for themselves. Accordingly, such processing can be modeled by reconﬁguring the RL model used in the Control task, which is referred to hereafter as simulation-free RL, because it directly associates the options with the outcomes without constructing the other’s decision-making process (Dayan and Niv, 2008). This model did not provide a good ﬁt to the behavioral data (see the next section) and can therefore be rejected.  An alternate interpretation is that the subjects focused only on the other’s outcomes, processing the other’s reward as their own reward, which may have allowed them to learn the reward probability from the assumed reward prediction error. But if this were true, there should have been no difference in their choice behavior between the Control and Other tasks. However, their choice behavior in the Control task was risk-averse and risk-neutral in the Other task, thus refuting this scenario. Nonetheless, it can still be argued that processing the other’s reward as their own might have caused the difference in risk behavior between the two tasks; processing the other’s reward as their own could have somehow suppressed the risk-averse tendency that existed when they performed for their own rewards, thereby rendering their choice behavior during the Other task similar to the other’s risk-neutral behavior. If so, the subjects’ choice behavior should always be risk-neutral in the Other task, irrespective of whether or not the other behaves in a risk-neutral manner. We tested this prediction using another version of the Other task in which the other was modeled by an RL model with a risk-averse setting, and found that, contrary to the prediction, the subjects’ behavior tracked that of the Other (Figure 1C). We conducted an additional experiment, adding this ‘‘risk-averse’’ Other task as a third task. The subjects’ behavior in the original two tasks replicated the ﬁndings of the original experiment. Their choices in the third task, however, did not match those made when the other was modeled by the risk-neutral RL model (p < 0.01, two-tailed paired t test), but followed the other’s choice behavior generated by the risk-averse RL model (p > 0.05, two-tailed paired t test). Moreover, the subjects’ answers to a postexperiment questionnaire conﬁrmed that they paid attention to both the outcomes and choices of the other (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). These results refute the above argument, and lend support to the notion that the subjects learned to simulate the other’s value-based decisions.  Fitting Reinforcement Learning Models for Simulating the Other’s Decision-Making Process to Behavior during the Other Task To determine what information subjects used to simulate the other’s behavior, we ﬁtted various computational models simu 1128 Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Simulation Learning of Others’ Decisions  when examined using other types of statistics: AIC values, a Bayesian comparison using the so-called Bayesian exceedance probability, and the ﬁt of a model of all the subjects together (Table S2). The S-RLsRPE+sAPE model successfully predicted >90% (0.9309 ± 0.0066) of the subjects’ choices. Furthermore, as expected from the behavioral results summarized above, only three subjects (3/36) exhibited risk-averse behavior when ﬁt to the S-RLsRPE+sAPE model.  In separate analyses, we conﬁrmed that the sRPE and sAPE provided different information, and that both had an inﬂuence on the subjects’ predictions of the other’s choices. First, both errors (and also their learning rates), as well as the information of the other’s actions and choices, were mostly uncorrelated (Supplemental Information), indicating that separate contributions of the two errors are possible. Second, the subjects’ choice behavior was found to change in relation to the sAPE (large or small) and the sRPE (positive or negative) in the previous trials and not to the combination of both (two-way repeated-measures ANOVA: p < 0.001 for the sRPE main effect, p < 0.001 for the sAPE main effect, p = 0.482 for their interaction; Figure S1B). This result provides behavioral evidence for separate contributions of the two errors to the subjects’ learning.  We next compared the S-RLsRPE+sAPE model to several of its variants. We ﬁrst examined whether including risk parameters at different levels affected the above ﬁnding. The original S-RLsRPE+sAPE model included the risk parameter only in the simulated-other’s level (computing the simulated-other’s choice probability), but it is possible to consider two other variants of this model: one including a risk parameter only in the subject’s level (computing the subject’s choice probability) and another including risk parameters in the subject’s and simulated-other’s levels. Goodness-of-ﬁt comparisons of the original S-RLsRPE+sAPE model with these variants supported the use of the original model (see the Supplemental Information). We then examined the performance of another type of variant, utilized in a recent study (Burke et al., 2010), that used the sAPE not for learning but for biasing the subject’s choices in the next (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Comparison of goodness of ﬁt between this variant and the original S-RLsRPE+sAPE model supported the superior ﬁt of the original model (p < 0.001, one-tailed paired t test). These results suggest that the subjects learned to simulate the other’s value-based decision-making processes using both the sRPE and sAPE.  trial  Neural Signals Reﬂecting the Simulated-Other’s Reward and Action Prediction Errors We next analyzed fMRI data to investigate which brain regions were involved in simulating the other’s decision making processes. Based on the ﬁt of the S-RLsRPE+sAPE model to the behavior in the Other task, we generated regressor variables of interest, including the subject’s reward probability at the time of decision (DECISION phase; Materials and Methods) and both the sRPE and sAPE at the time of outcome (OUTCOME phase), and entered them into our whole-brain regression analysis. Similarly, fMRI data from the Control task were analyzed using regressor variables based on the ﬁt of the RL model to the subjects’ behavior.  BOLD responses that signiﬁcantly correlated with the sRPE were found only in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC; p < 0.05, corrected; Figure 2A; Table 1). When these signals were extracted using the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to provide an independent criterion for region of interest (ROI) selection and thus ensure statistical validity (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009), and then binned according to the sRPE magnitude, the signals increased as the error increased (Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient: 0.178, p < 0.05; Figure 2B). As expected for the sRPE, vmPFC signals were found to be positively correlated with the other’s outcome and negatively correlated with the simulated-other’s reward probability (Figure S2A). As activity in the vmPFC is often broadly correlated with value signals and ‘‘self’’ reward prediction error (Berns et al., 2001; O’Doherty et al., 2007), we further conﬁrmed that the vmPFC signals truly corresponded to the sRPE and were not induced by other variables. The vmPFC signals remained signiﬁcantly correlated with the sRPE (p < 0.05, corrected) even when the following potential confounders were added to our regression analysis: the simulated-other’s reward probability, the simulated-other’s value for the stimulus chosen by the other as well as by the subject, and the subject’s own reward prediction error and reward probability. The vmPFC signals also remained significant even when the regressor variable of the sRPE was ﬁrst orthogonalized to the sAPE and then included in the regression analysis (p < 0.05, corrected). Finally, instead of using the original sRPE, we used the error with the reward magnitude (i.e., the sRPE multiplied by the reward magnitude of the stimulus chosen by the other in each trial) as a regressor in whole-brain analysis. The vmPFC was the only brain area showing activity that was signiﬁcantly correlated with this error (p < 0.05, corrected). These results suggest that activity in the vmPFC exclusively contained information about the sRPE.  The sAPE was signiﬁcantly correlated with changes in BOLD signals in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC; p < 0.05, corrected), the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; p < 0.05, corrected; Figure 2C), and several other regions (Table 1). The dmPFC/dlPFC activity continued to be signiﬁcantly correlated with the action prediction error, even after cross-validation (dmPFC: 0.200, p < 0.05; dlPFC: 0.248, p < 0.05; Figure 2D). The dmPFC/dlPFC signals remained signiﬁcant when potential confounders (the simulated-other’s reward probability of the stimulus chosen by the other as well as by the subject) were added to the regression analyses (p < 0.05, corrected) or when the regressor variable of the sAPE was ﬁrst orthogonalized to the sRPE and then included in the regression analysis (p < 0.05, corrected). We also conﬁrmed signiﬁcant activation in the dmPFC/dlPFC (p < 0.05, corrected) even when the action prediction error at the action level was used as a regressor variable instead of the error at the value level. The dmPFC/dlPFC areas with signiﬁcant activation considerably overlapped with the areas originally associated with the signiﬁcant activation, using the error at the value level (Figure S2B).  Given these ﬁndings, we further hypothesized that if the neuronal activity in these brain regions encodes the sRPE and sAPE, then any variability in these signals across subjects should affect their simulation learning and should therefore be reﬂected in the variation in updating the simulated-other’s value using  Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc. 1129  Simulation Learning of Others’ Decisions  Neuron  Figure 2. Neural Activity Correlated with the Simulated-Other’s Reward and Action Prediction Errors (A) Neural activity in the vmPFC correlated signiﬁcantly with the magnitude of the sRPE at the time of outcome (Talairach coordinates: x = 0, y = 53, z = 4). The maps in (A) and (C) are thresholded at p < 0.005, uncorrected for display. (B) Crossvalidated, mean percent changes in the BOLD signals in the vmPFC (across subjects, n = 36; error bars = ± SEM; 7–9 s after the onset of the outcome) during trials in which the sRPE was low, medium, or high (the 33rd, 66th, or 100th percentiles, respectively). (C) Neural activity in the dmPFC (x = 6, y = 14, z = 52) and dlPFC (x = 45, y = 11, z = 43) correlated signiﬁcantly with the magnitude of the sAPE at the time of outcome (left: sagittal view; right: axial view). (D) Crossvalidated, mean percent changes in the BOLD signals in the dmPFC and dlPFC (7–9 s after the onset of the outcome) during trials in which the sAPE was low, medium, or high.  these errors. In other words, subjects with larger or smaller neural signals in a ROI should exhibit larger or smaller behavioral learning effects due to the error (i.e., display larger or smaller learning rates associated with each error).  To test this hypothesis, we investigated the subjects’ grouplevel correlations (Figure 3). Individual differences in the vmPFC BOLD signals of the sRPE (measured by the estimated magnitude of the error’s regressor’s coefﬁcient; called the ‘‘effect size’’) were correlated with individual differences in the learning rates of the sRPE (determined by the ﬁt of the S-RLsRPE+sAPE model to the behavioral data), while those in the dmPFC/dlPFC BOLD signals of the sAPE were correlated with those in the learning rates of the sAPE. First, the vmPFC activity was signiﬁcantly correlated with the learning rate of the sRPE (Figure 3A, left; Spearman’s r = 0.360, p < 0.05), even though the explained variance was relatively small (measured by the square of Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient, r2 = 0.124). We conducted two additional analyses to guard against potential subject outliers that may have compounded the original correlation analysis. The correlation remained signiﬁcant even when removing all outliers by a Jackknife outlier detection method (r = 0.447, p < 0.005) or using the robust correlation coefﬁcient (r0 = 0.346, p < 0.05) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Thus, the observed modulation of vmPFC activity lends correlative support to our hypothesis that variations in the vmPFC signals (putative signals of the sRPE) are associated with the behavioral variability caused by learning using the sRPE across subjects.  Second, the dmPFC/dlPFC activity was signiﬁcantly correlated with the learning rate of the sAPE (Figure 3B, r = 0.330, p < 0.05; r2 = 0.140; and Figure 3C, r = 0.294, p < 0.05; r2 = 0.230). The correlations remained signiﬁcant after removing the outliers (dmPFC, r = 0.553, p < 0.0005; dlPFC, r = 0.382, p < 0.05) or using the robust correlation coefﬁcient (dmPFC, r0 = 0.377, p < 0.005; dlPFC, r0 = 0.478, p < 0.01). These results support our hypothesis that the variation in the dmPFC and dlPFC signals (putative signals of the sAPE) is associated with the behavioral variability caused by learning using the sAPE across subjects.  Shared Representations of Value-Based Decision Making for the Self and Simulated-Other We next investigated whether the pattern of vmPFC activity was shared between the self and simulated-other’s decision processes in two aspects. First, the vmPFC region was the only region modulated by the sRPE in the Other task. The sRPE was based on simulating the other’s process in a social setting, generated in reference to the simulated-other’s reward probability that they estimated to substitute for the other’s hidden variable. We were then interested in knowing whether the same vmPFC region contained signals for the subject’s own reward prediction error during the Control task in a nonsocial setting without the simulation. Second, at the time of decision in the Other task, subjects made their choices to indicate their predictions of the other’s choices based on the simulation,  1130 Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Simulation Learning of Others’ Decisions  Table 1.

The regions of interest discussed in the text are shown in bold. vmPFC: ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dlPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; dmPFC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; Hemi, hemisphere; BA, Brodmann area. aThe vmPFC region referred to here and in Table 2 is in the vicinity of cluster 2 referred to by Beckmann and colleagues (Beckmann et al., 2009; Rushworth et al., 2011). Upon a closer examination, the locus of the activated vmPFC region is actually located between the BA 10 and 32, and resembles cluster 2, which is also known as area 14 m (Mackey and Petrides, 2010).  whereas in the Control task, they made their choices to obtain the best outcome for themselves without the simulation. Thus, we were also interested in whether the same vmPFC region contained signals for the subjects’ decision variables in both types of decisions. To address these issues, we examined the neural correlates of these variables in whole-brain analyses during both tasks and then conducted cross-validating ROI analyses. We found that the vmPFC was modulated by signals related to the subject’s own reward probability in the Other task. Wholebrain analysis during the Other task identiﬁed BOLD signals in several brain regions, including the vmPFC (p < 0.05, corrected; Figure 4A), that were signiﬁcantly modulated by the subject’s reward probability (for the stimulus chosen by the subject) at the time of decision (Table 1). The subject’s reward probability is the decision variable closest to their choices, as it is the farthest downstream in the hypothesized computational processes for generating their choices, but it is also based on simulating the other’s decision-making processes, in particular, the simulated-other’s reward probability (Figure S1A). To determine whether the activation of the vmPFC that was signiﬁcantly modulated by the subject’s reward probability was compounded by, or possibly rather due to, the simulated-other’s reward probability, we conducted two additional whole-brain analyses: when the simulated-other’s reward probability (for the stimulus chosen by the subject) was added to the regression analysis as a potential confounder and when the regressor variable of the subject’s probability was ﬁrst orthogonalized to the simulated-other’s reward probability and then included in the regression analysis together with the simulated-other’s reward probability. In both cases, vmPFC activation remained signiﬁ cantly modulated by the subject’s reward probability (p < 0.05, corrected). These results indicate that at the time of decision during the Other task, vmPFC activation was signiﬁcantly modulated by the subject’s reward probability.  For comparison, the signiﬁcant vmPFC signals related to the sRPE are also shown in Figure 4A. Here, we emphasize that the sRPE was not the subject’s own reward prediction error (the difference between the subject’s own outcome and his/her own reward probability) during the Other task. Indeed, no region was signiﬁcantly activated by the subject’s own reward prediction error during the Other task. This observation was conﬁrmed by an additional whole-brain analysis that was conducted in the same way as the original analysis, except that we added the regressor variable for the subject’s own reward prediction error and removed the regressors for the sRPE and sAPE.  Whole-brain analysis during the Control task revealed signiﬁcant modulation of vmPFC activity (p < 0.05, corrected) by the reward probability (for the stimulus chosen by the subject) at the time of the decision and the reward prediction error at the time of the outcome (Figure 4B; Table 2). These activities remained signiﬁcant (p < 0.05, corrected) when the following potential confounders were added to the analysis: the reward magnitude of the chosen stimulus with the reward probability and the value and reward probabilities of the chosen stimulus with the reward prediction error.  We next employed four crossvalidating ROI analyses to investigate whether the same vmPFC region contained signals that were signiﬁcantly modulated by all four of the variables of interest: the subject’s own reward probability (RP) and the sRPE in the Other task (Figure 4A) and the subject’s own RP  Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc. 1131  Simulation Learning of Others’ Decisions  Neuron  Figure 3.

Whole-brain analyses deﬁned an ROI in the vmPFC for each of these variables. We then examined whether the neural activity in a given ROI was signiﬁcantly modulated by any or all of the other three variables. Indeed, each of the given ROIs in the vmPFC contained signals that were signiﬁcantly modulated by each of the variables deﬁning the other three ROIs (either p < 0.05 or p < 0.005; Figure 4C). We also conducted the same analysis using a Gaussian ﬁlter (full width at half-maximum (FWHM) = 6 mm) for spatial smoothing during image data preprocessing that was narrower than the original ﬁlter (FWHM = 8 mm). In this case, three of the variables, not RP in the Control task, had signiﬁcant activation in the vmPFC (p < 0.05, corrected; with RP in the Control task, cluster size = 21, which was less than the 33 required for a corrected p < 0.05 with the narrower Gaussian ﬁlter). However, when the ROI for RP in the Control task was deﬁned under the liberal threshold, we again observed that the activity in a given ROI of one variable was signiﬁcantly modulated by each of the other three variables (p < 0.05). The observation in the original analysis remained true (p < 0.05) even if we used an orthogonalized variable in the ROI analysis (see the Supplemental Information). These results indicate that the same region of the vmPFC contains neural signals for the subjects’ decisions in both the Control and Other tasks, as well as signals for learning from reward prediction errors either with or without simulation.  DISCUSSION  We examined behavior in a choice paradigm that to our knowledge is new, in which subjects must learn and predict another’s value-based decisions. As this paradigm involved observing the other without directly interacting with them, we were able to focus on the most basic form of simulation learning (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Frith and Frith, 1999; Mitchell, 2009). Collectively, our results support the idea of simulation of the other’s  1132 Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc.  process by direct recruitment of one’s own process, but they also suggest a critical revision to this direct recruitment hypothesis. We found that subjects simultaneously tracked two distinct prediction error signals in simulation learning: the simulatedother’s reward and action prediction errors, sRPE and sAPE, respectively. The sRPE signiﬁcantly modulated signals only in the vmPFC, indicating a prominent role of this area in simulation learning by direct recruitment. However, we also found that simulation learning utilized an accessory learning signal: the sAPE with neural representation in the dmPFC/dlPFC.  Shared Representation between Self and Simulated-Other Our ﬁndings indicate that the vmPFC is a canonical resource for a shared representation between the self and the simulatedother in value-based decision making. By employing a withinsubjects design for the Control and Other tasks, the present study provides, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst direct evidence that vmPFC is the area in which representations of reward prediction error are shared between the self and the simulated-other. Subjects used the sRPE to learn the other’s hidden variable and the vmPFC was the only brain region with BOLD signals that were signiﬁcantly modulated by both the subject’s reward prediction error in the Control task and the subject’s sRPE in the Other task. Moreover, our ﬁndings also provide direct evidence that the same vmPFC region is critical for the subject’s decisions, whether or not the other’s process was simulated. In both tasks, vmPFC signals were signiﬁcantly modulated by the subject’s decision variable (the subject’s reward probability) at the time their decisions were made. Mentalizing by direct recruitment requires the same neural circuitry for shared representations between the self and the simulated-other. Even apart from direct recruitment, shared representations between the self and the other are considered to play an important role in other forms of social cognition, such as empathy.

For encoding learning signals, the vmPFC is likely more adaptive than the ventral striatum. In contrast to the vmPFC signals, signals in the ventral striatum were signiﬁcantly modulated only by the subject’s own reward prediction error in the Control task (Figure S3; Table 2). The vmPFC was preferentially recruited to simulate the other’s process in this study, concordant with the general notion that the vmPFC may encode signals related to reward prediction error when internal models are involved (O’Doherty et al., 2007). The vmPFC may be more sensitive to task demands. During the Other task, no area was signiﬁcantly  modulated by the subject’s own reward prediction error. This might be simply due to a limitation in the task design, as the ﬁxed reward size for subjects might have limited detection of reward prediction error. Another aspect, however, is that the subject’s own reward prediction error was not as useful as the sRPE for learning to predict the other’s choices in this task. Also, the vmPFC may be speciﬁcally recruited when subjects used the other’s outcomes for learning, as in the Other task, rather than when they vicariously appreciated the other’s outcomes. The activity in the ventral striatum might be evoked only when the other’s outcomes are more ‘‘personal’’ to subjects (Moll et al., 2006), e.g., when they are comparing their own outcomes to the other’s outcomes (Fliessbach et al., 2007; Rilling et al., 2002) or when there are similarities between their  Table 2.

This would allow the error to be ﬂexibly integrated with other types of processing, thereby leading to better and more efﬁcient learning and decision making (Alexander and Brown, 2011; Hayden et al., 2011).  The sAPE was a speciﬁc form of action prediction error related to the other, which was generated in reference to the simulatedother’s choice probability and used to learn the simulatedother’s variable. Activity in the dmPFC/dlPFC can also be modulated by different forms of action prediction error related to the other and to improvement of the subject’s own valuation (Behrens et al., 2008; Burke et al., 2010). Burke et al. (2010) found that activity in the dlPFC was modulated by an observational action prediction error (the difference between the other’s actual stimulus choice and the subject’s own choice probability). Behrens et al. (2008) found that activity in the dmPFC was signiﬁcantly modulated by the ‘‘confederate prediction error’’ (the difference between the actual and expected ﬁdelity of the confederate). Their error was used to learn the probability that a confederate was lying in parallel to, but separate from, the learning of the subject’s stimulus-reward probability. At the time of decision, subjects could utilize the confederate-lying probability to improve their own decisions. In contrast, in our Other task, subjects needed to predict the other’s choices. One possible interpretation is that dmPFC and dlPFC differentially utilize the other’s action prediction errors for learning, drawing on different forms of the other’s action expectation and/or frames of reference, depending on task demands (Baumgartner et al., 2009; Cooper et al., 2010; de Bruijn et al., 2009; Huettel et al., 2006).  Our ﬁndings support a posterior-to-anterior axis interpretation of the dmPFC signals with an increasing order of abstractness to represent the other’s internal variable (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Mitchell et al., 2006). The sAPE was in reference to the other’s actual choices, whereas the confederate prediction error was in reference to the truth of the other’s communicative intentions rather than their choices. Correspondingly, a comparison of the dmPFC regions activated in this study with those in Behrens et al. (2008) suggests that the dmPFC region identiﬁed in this study was slightly posterior to the region they identiﬁed. Furthermore, our ﬁndings also support an axis interpretation between the vmPFC and dmPFC. The sRPE is a more ‘‘inner,’’ and thus more abstract, variable for simulation than the sAPE. While the sRPE and sAPE were generated with the simulated-other’s reward and choice probability, respectively, this choice probability was generated in each trial by using the reward probability. Altogether, we propose that the sAPE is a general, critical component for simulation learning. The sAPE provides an additional, but also ‘‘natural,’’ learning signal that could arise from simulation by direct recruitment, as it was readily generated from the simulated-other’s choice probability given the subject’s observation of the other’s choices. This error should be useful for reﬁning the learning of the other’s hidden variables, particularly if the other behaves differently from the way one would expect for oneself, i.e., the prediction made by direct recruitment simulation (Mitchell et al., 2006). As such, we consider this error and the associated pattern of neural activation to be an accessory signal to the core simulation process of valuation occurring in the vmPFC, which further suggests a more general hierarchy of  own and the other’s personal characteristics (Mobbs et al., 2009).  The sRPE was a speciﬁc form of reward prediction error related to the other, made in reference to the simulated-other and used for learning their hidden variables. Different forms of the other’s reward prediction error also modulated activity in the vmPFC. Activity in the vmPFC was correlated with an ‘‘observational’’ reward prediction error (the difference between the other’s stimulus choice outcome and the subject’s value of the stimulus) (Burke et al., 2010; Cooper et al., 2011). This error indicated which stimulus was more likely to be rewarding to subjects, whereas in the study presented here, the sRPE indicated which stimulus was more likely to be rewarding to the other. vmPFC signals have also been reported to be modulated by different perceptions of the other’s intentions (Cooper et al., 2010). An interesting avenue for future research is to deepen our understanding of the relationship between, and use of, different types of vicarious reward prediction errors involved in forms of ﬁctive or counterfactual learning (Behrens et al., 2008; Boorman et al., 2011; Hayden et al., 2009; Lohrenz et al., 2007).  Reﬁnement of Simulation Learning: Action-Prediction Error Our ﬁndings demonstrate that during simulation, humans use another learning signal—the sAPE—to model the other’s internal variables. This error was entirely unexpected based on the direct recruitment hypothesis, and it indicates that simulation is dynamically reﬁned during learning using observations of the other’s choices, thus also rejecting the stronger hypothesis.  The sAPE signiﬁcantly modulated BOLD signals in the dmPFC/dlPFC and several other areas (Table 1), but the sRPE did not. This activation pattern suggests that these areas may have a particular role in utilizing the other’s choices rather than the other’s outcomes (Amodio and Frith, 2006). This view is convergent with earlier studies in a social context, in which subjects considered the other’s behaviors, choices, or intentions, but not necessarily their outcomes (Barraclough et al., 2004; Hampton et al., 2008; Izuma et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2006; Yoshida et al., 2010, 2011), and also with studies in nonsocial settings (Gla¨ scher et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Rushworth, 2008). Among the other areas, the temporoparietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus (TPJ/pSTS) were noteworthy. Our results support a role for the TPJ/pSTS in utilizing the other’s choices, consistent with previous studies using RL paradigms in social settings (Behrens et al., 2008; Hampton et al., 2008; Haruno and Kawato, 2009).  Our ﬁndings that the dmPFC/dlPFC and TPJ/pSTS were signiﬁcantly activated by the sAPE in both the value and action levels provide an important twist on the distinction between action and outcome encoding or between action and outcome monitoring (Amodio and Frith, 2006). The signals in those areas represented a result of action monitoring, but were also in a form that was immediately available for learning outcome expectation (the simulated-other’s reward probability). is intriguing to speculate that all of the processes involved in this error, from generating (in the action level) and transforming (from the action to value level) to representing the error as a learning signal for valuation (in the value level), may occur  It  1134 Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Simulation Learning of Others’ Decisions  learning signals in simulation apart from and beyond the sAPE. As the other’s choice behavior in this study was only related to a speciﬁc personality or psychological isotype, being risk neutral, it will be interesting to see whether and how the sAPE is modiﬁed to facilitate learning about the other depending on different personality or psychological isotypes of the other. Also, in this study, because we chose to investigate the sAPE as a general signal, learning about the nature of the other’s risk behavior or risk parameters in our model was treated as secondary, being ﬁxed in all trials. However, subjects might have learned the other’s risk parameter and/or adjusted their own risk parameter over the course of the trials. How these types of learning complement simulation learning examined in the present study shown here will require further investigation.  Together, we demonstrate that simulation requires distinct prefrontal circuits to learn the other’s valuation process by direct recruitment and to reﬁne the overall learning trajectory by tracking the other’s behavioral variation. Because our approach used a fundamental form of simulation learning, we expect that our ﬁndings may be broadly relevant to modeling and predicting the behavior of others in many domains of cognition, including higher level mentalizing in more complex tasks involving social interactions, recursive reasoning, and/or different task goals. We propose that the signals and computations underlying higher level mentalizing in complex social interactions might be built upon those identiﬁed in the present study. It remains to be determined how the simulated-other’s reward and action prediction error signals are utilized and modiﬁed when task complexity is increased. In this regard, we suggest that the simulation process and the associated neural circuits identiﬁed in this study can be conceptualized as a cognitive scaffold upon which multiple context-dependent mentalizing signals may be recruited as available learning signals and may thus contribute to prediction, depending on the subject’s goals in the social environment.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  We provide a more comprehensive description of the materials and methods in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.  Subjects Thirty-nine healthy, normal subjects participated in the fMRI experiment. Subjects received monetary rewards proportional to the points they earned in four test sessions (two fMRI scan sessions, from which behavioral and imaging data are reported in the main text, and two test sessions not involving fMRI, for which data are not shown) in addition to a base participation fee. After excluding three subjects based on their outlier choice behaviors, the remaining 36 subjects were used for subsequent behavioral and fMRI data analyses. A separate behavioral experiment involved 24 normal subjects, and excluding two outlier subjects, the remaining 22 subjects were used for the ﬁnal analysis (Figure 1C). All subjects gave their informed written consent, and the study was approved by RIKEN’s Third Research Ethics Committee.  Experimental Tasks Two tasks, the Control and Other tasks, were conducted (Figure 1A). The Control task was a one-armed bandit task (Behrens et al., 2007). The two stimuli with randomly assigned reward magnitudes, indicated by numbers in their centers, were randomly positioned at the left or right of the ﬁxation point. In every trial, the reward magnitudes were randomly sampled, independently of the stimuli, but with an additional constraint that the same stimulus was not assigned the higher magnitude in three successive trials; this constraint  was introduced, in addition to reward magnitude randomization, to further ensure that subjects did not repeatedly choose the same stimulus (see Figure S1D for control analyses). After subjects made their choice, the chosen stimulus was immediately highlighted by a gray frame. Later, the rewarded stimulus was revealed in the center of the screen. Subjects were not informed of the probability, but were instructed that the reward probabilities were independent of the reward magnitudes.  In the Other task, subjects predicted the choice of another person. From the CUE to the ISI phase, the images on the screen were identical to those in the Control task in terms of presentation. However, the two stimuli presented in the CUE were generated for the other person performing the Control task. The subjects’ prediction of the choice made by the other was immediately highlighted by a gray frame. In the OUTCOME, the other’s actual choice was highlighted by a red frame, and the rewarded stimulus for the other was indicated in the center. When the subjects’ predicted choice matched the other’s actual choice, they earned a ﬁxed reward. The RL model generated the choices of the other on a risk-neutral basis (for the fMRI experiment), so that the choices generated by the model approximately mimicked average (riskneutral) human behavior, allowing us to use the same type of the other’s behavior for all subjects (see Figure S1C for a separate behavioral analysis of this approach).  For the experiment in the MRI scanner, two tasks, Control and Other, were employed. Three conditions, one Control and two Others, were used in a separate behavioral experiment (Figure 1C). The settings for the Control and ‘‘Other I’’ task were the same as in the fMRI experiment, but in the ‘‘Other II’’ task, a risk-averse RL model was used to generate the other’s choices.  Behavioral Analysis and Computational Models Fitted to Behavior Several computational models, based on and modiﬁed from the Q learning model (Sutton and Barto, 1998), were ﬁt to the subjects’ choice behaviors in both tasks. In the Control task, the RL model, being risk neutral, constructed Q values of both stimuli; the value of a stimulus was the product of the stimulus’ reward probability, pðAÞ (for stimulus A; the following description is made for this case), and the reward magnitude of the stimulus in a given trial, RðAÞ,  QA = pðAÞRðAÞ:  (1)  To account for possible risk behavior of the subjects, we followed the approach of Behrens et al. (2007) by using a simple nonlinear function (see the Supplemental Information for more details and for a control analysis of the nonlinear function). The choice probability is given by qðAÞ = fðQA   QBÞ, where f is a sigmoidal function. The reward prediction error was used to update the stimulus’ reward probability (see the Supplemental Information for a control analysis),  d = r   pðAÞ;  (2)  where r is the reward outcome (1 if stimulus A is rewarded and 0 otherwise). The reward probability was updated using pðAÞ)pðAÞ + hd. In the Other task, the S-RLsRPE+sAPE model computed the subject’s choice probability using qðAÞ = fðQA   QBÞ; here, the value of a stimulus is the product of the subject’s ﬁxed reward outcome and their reward probability based on simulating the other’s decision making, which is equivalent to the simulatedother’s choice probability: qo(A) = f(QO(A)   QO(B)), wherein the other’s value of a stimulus is the product of the other’s reward magnitude of the stimulus and the simulated-other’s reward probability, pOðAÞ. When the outcome for the other ðrOÞ was revealed, the S-RLsRPE+sAPE model updated the simu lated-other’s reward probability, using both the sRPE and the sAPE,  pOðAÞ)pOðAÞ + hsRPE dOðAÞ + hsAPE sOðAÞ;  (3)  where the two h’s indicate the respective learning rates. The sRPE was given by  doðAÞ = ro   poðAÞ:  (4)  The sAPE was deﬁned in the value level, being comparable to the sRPE.  After being generated ﬁrst in the action level,  OðAÞ = IAðAÞ   qOðAÞ = 1   qOðAÞ; s0  (5)  Neuron 74, 1125–1137, June 21, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc. 1135  the sAPE was obtained by a variational transformation, pulled back to the value level,  sOðAÞ = s0  O  ðAÞ K  Simulation Learning of Others’ Decisions  Neuron  Amodio, D.M., and Frith, C.D.

The two other simulation-RL models only used one of the two prediction errors. The simulation-free RL model is described in the Supplemental Information.  We used a maximum-likelihood approach to ﬁt the models to the individual subject’s behaviors and AIC to compare their goodness of ﬁt, taking into account the different numbers of the models’ parameters. For a given model’s ﬁt to each subject’s behavior in a task, the inclusion of the risk parameter was determined using the AIC value to compare the ﬁt by two variants of the given model, with or without including the risk parameter.  fMRI Acquisition and Analysis fMRI images were collected using a 4 T MRI system (Agilient Inc., Santa Clara, CA). BOLD signals were measured using a two-shot EPI sequence. High- and low-resolution whole-brain anatomical images were acquired using a T1weighted 3D FLASH pulse sequence. All images were analyzed using Brain Voyager QX 2.1 (Brain Innovation B.V., Maastricht, The Netherlands). Functional images were preprocessed, including spatial smoothing with a Gaussian ﬁlter (FWHM = 8 mm). Anatomical images were transformed into the standard Talairach space (TAL) and functional images were registered to high-resolution anatomical images. All activations were reported based on the TAL, except for the activation in the ventral striatum reported in Figure S3 (see legend).  We employed model-based analysis to analyze the BOLD signals. The main variables of interest as the regressors for our regression analyses were, for the Control task, the reward probability of the stimulus chosen in the DECISION period (deﬁned as the period from the onset of CUE until subjects made their responses in the RESPONSE period) and the reward prediction error in the OUTCOME period. For the Other task, the main variables of interest were the subject’s reward probability for the stimulus chosen in the DECISION period, and the sRPE and sAPE in the OUTCOME period. Random-effects analysis was employed using a one-tailed t test. Signiﬁcant BOLD signals were reported based on corrected p values (p < 0.05) using a family-wise error for multiple comparison corrections (cluster-level inference). For cross-validated percent changes in the BOLD signals (Figures 2B and 2D), we followed a previously described leave-one-out procedure (Gla¨ scher et al., 2010). For the correlation analysis (Figure 3), we calculated Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient and tested its statistical signiﬁcance using a one-tailed t test given our hypothesis of positive correlation (see the Supplemental Information for two additional analyses).

Positive and negative self-appraisals also shape current emotional states or even evoke defensive reactions, when they are incongruent with a subject’s current state. Prior studies have mainly used externally given evaluative appraisals. In this study, 30 subjects used individual negative and positive self-appraisals during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We additionally investigated the eﬀects of such self-appraisals onto the subsequent perception of photos of the individual subjects. Both selfappraisal conditions activated dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the neutral condition. Positive self-appraisal evoked stronger activity than negative self-appraisal in the amygdala, ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex, whereas negative self-appraisal was associated with increased activity in the occipital regions. Positive self-appraisal had no eﬀect on the perception of a photo of oneself, whereas negative appraisal increased activity in the anterior insula and parietal regions. Overall, positive self-appraisal activated more emotion-related brain regions, whereas negative self-appraisal had a relatively stronger inﬂuence on perception-related brain activity. These ﬁndings could on the one hand explain the eﬀect of negative self-appraisal on the behavior in the real world and on the other hand support a stronger focus of  *Corresponding author.

INTRODUCTION  and  cognitive  inﬂuenced by reactions  Self-worth or state self-esteem is supposed to be an important aspect of health and well-being. According to the top-down theory of self-worth or state self-esteem (Brown et al., 2001; Brown and Marshall, 2006), selfself-evaluative worth is particularly emotional (Brown and Mankowski, 1993; Brown and Dutton, 1995; Brown et al., 2001). In contrast, trait or global self-esteem is seen as a stable view of oneself in general, which develops early in life (Brown et al., 2001). Modulations of self-worth provoke emotional and motivational responses (Leary, 1999; Crocker and Park, 2004), as it is a fundamental aspect of human nature to feel good about oneself (James, 1890, cited in Leary, 1999).  I  Self-appraisals and self-validations inﬂuence state self-esteem and shape the actual emotional state and vice versa (Beck, 1976; Crocker and Park, 2004; Wood et al., 2009): When I am conﬁdent in myself, I feel good; if not, feel bad. These aﬀective reactions to selfappraisals and self-worth manipulations further inﬂuence one’s perception, experience and memory of general events (recent studies: e.g. Bouhuys et al., 1995; Coupland et al., 2004; Lupyan and Swingley, 2012; review: Mathews and MacLeod, 1994) as well as performance and motivation (Rosin and Nelson, 1983; Senay et al., 2010). Typical examples of positive and negative self-appraisals are inner speech phrases such as ‘I am a looser’ or ‘I am competent’.  In mental disorders, self-esteem is reduced in general (e.g. Silverstone and Salsali, 2003), but the distinction between trait- and state-eﬀects in vulnerability and remission is not yet totally clear (Butler et al., 1994). In hypomanic states, views of the self are typically inﬂated, whereas depression is characterized by a negative perspective on the self (Beck, 1967; Beck and Dozois, 2011). In major depressive disorder and in social anxiety are particularly prominent (Beck, 1976; Cox et al., 2000; Michalak et al., 2011).  self-evaluations  disorder,  negative  A. B.

Compared to the ﬁrst person perspective, the third person perspective has been projected rather onto dorsally located cortical midline structures (Vogeley et al., 2004; Esslen et al., 2008). In general, tasks addressing self-esteem involve a strong verbal-reﬂective and third person perspective (e.g. I am capable of . . .), paralleled by according neural ﬁndings (e.g. Fossati et al., 2003; Frewen et al., 2013).  Brain regions typically activated in self-referential tasks comprise cortical midline structures such as dorsoand ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC, PCC), and medial parietal regions (e.g. Fossati et al., 2003; Somerville et al., 2010, meta-analysis: Northoﬀ et al., 2006). These midline structures are strongly associated with selfreference, but are also activated in for instance emotion regulation (e.g. Diekhof et al., 2011). Furthermore, diﬀerent self-referential tasks detected activations in ventral and dorsal lateral prefrontal regions (Moran et al., 2006; D’Argembeau et al., 2012), insula (Fossati et al., 2003; D’Argembeau et al., 2012) and, when emotional valence was included, in the amygdala (Frewen et al., 2013). The insula has also been linked to interoceptive self-awareness (Simmons et al., 2013).  The so-called sociometer hypothesis is another, partly conﬂicting theory on state self-esteem or self-worth (Leary, 1999). This hypothesis emphasizes the importance of acceptance or rejection by others and the striving to be accepted by the social environment (Leary, 1999). A number of studies have shown that social exclusion or rejection activated brain regions such as dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insular cortex, which are known to be associated with distress and even physical pain (e.g. Eisenberger et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2009; Somerville et al., 2010). Activation in dorsal ACC was in other studies correlated with trait rejection sensitivity (Burklund et al., 2007) and greater selfreported social distress (Eisenberger et al., 2007).  However, investigations on the eﬀect of evaluations by others on self-esteem have shown that, depending on current self-esteem, incongruent evaluations can rather provoke defensive reactions than inﬂuence feelings of Self-evaluations, self-worth however, play a major role in changes of feelings of self-worth (e.g. Steele, 1988; Dutton and Brown, 1997).  Brown,  2010).  (e.g.  The current study aimed therefore, and because of the clinical relevance of self-appraisal, at investigating (a) the neural correlates of short negative and positive selfappraisals/evaluations, which are short manipulations of self-worth, and (b) the eﬀects of these self-appraisals on the neural correlates of the perception of photos of oneself. The short self-evaluations used here are more common in day-to-day mental self-talk than the typically longer mood induction procedures such as the Velten  mood induction procedure (Velten, 1968) in self-esteem research (e.g. Brown and Mankowski, 1993).  In this study we investigated the neurobiological background of self-appraisals. Understanding the neural mechanisms may serve to better understand the the application of self-appraisal as a mechanisms of self-regulating or as proposed by positive psychology (Seligman et al., 2006; Sin and Lyubomirsky, 2009), and it may provide a method to investigate the respective pathophysiological circuits in heightened or depressed moods.  psychotherapeutic  technique  In this study, participants were instructed to make themselves aware of own positive and negative aspects and to tell themselves individual self-talk sentences such as ‘‘I am good (at. . .)’’, ‘‘I will manage XX’’ or ‘‘I am a looser’’, ‘‘I will never manage YY’’ (the sentences were not revealed to the experimenters). These selfappraisal conditions were each followed by photographs of the participants to investigate the inﬂuence of selfappraisal and respective self-worth manipulations on the perception of these pictures.  We expected the self-appraisal  to trigger valencecongruent aﬀective reactions and to inﬂuence the perception of photos of oneself accordingly, i.e. after boosting self-worth a more positive view of oneself than after challenging and perhaps diminishing self-worth. On the neurobiological level, we hypothesized brain regions activated, which are associated  (a) with self-reference (particularly third person perspective self-reference), such as dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC, Northoﬀ and Bermpohl, 2004; Herwig et al., 2010b, 2012),  (b) with evaluation/appraisal, such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, e.g. MacDonald et al., 2000; Longe et al., 2010), and ACC (Carter and van Veen, 2007), as well as  (c) with emotion processing, such as the amygdala (Baxter and Murray, 2002; Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010), insula (Craig, 2009; Paulus and Stein, 2010) and ventral striatum (McClure et al., 2004).  In these regions and additionally in the whole-brain, the eﬀects of self-appraisal itself and on the subsequent perception of photos of the participant were analyzed.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Participants  Thirty healthy subjects (age between 20 and 50 years, mean 32 years; 19 females, all consistently right-handed according to a handedness questionnaire (Annett, 1970), mainly students of psychology or medicine or health care professionals) were included in this study. As assessed with semi-structured interviews according to DSM-IV and checklists performed by an experienced psychiatrist (ABB), the exclusion criteria comprised prior and current neurological or psychiatric illnesses, pregnancy, intake of medication or psychotropic substances including the excessive consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and related to caﬀeine, and general  contraindications  50  A.

Further, the actual and trait mood and anxiety were assessed with German versions of the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS; Zung, 2005; mean 35, range 26.25–45) and the State-Trait Anxiety-Inventory (STAI, Laux et al., 1981; mean 31.25, range 23–50) in order to detect relevant mood disturbances. All of the subjects gave their written informed consent prior to participation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. After imaging, the subjects completed an interview that examined their performance on the task.  Experimental task  (ranging from portrait  Prior scanning, 12 photographs of each participant were taken by the experimenters within the grounds of the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich. Situations, positions to whole body), background and perspectives were standardized in a script (see example in Fig. 1, similar to Herwig et al., 2012). When taking the photos, participants were instructed to display relaxed and neutral facial and bodily expressions, particularly no marked emotional expression (normal friendly ‘photo-smile’ was permitted).  Fig. 1. Experimental task: three diﬀerent conditions were presented, which consisted of a cued self-appraisal period in the positive or negative domain or a neutral condition with 12 runs each, and a photo presentation of the subject with the same 12 photographs was presented in each condition.  Clothing was neutral and casual. The participants were shown some of the pictures prior scanning as examples. During fMRI scanning, the task was built as (slow) event-related design comprising per trial a sequence of a self-appraisal (either positive or negative) or a neutral anticipation period followed by the perception of one of the photos of the participant. Thereafter, a baseline (ﬁxation cross, duration 15840 ms) allowed the BOLD signal to level oﬀ. Each of the pictures was shown three times to the participant, once after each condition (positive, negative, and neutral), such that the same 12 photos were shown in the three conditions in a randomized order for each condition. Valence of selfappraisal was randomized as well. The task was given in a single run of total 36 trials (584 volumes, duration about 20 min). Each single trial started by a simple cue (duration 1000 ms, Fig. 1) that indicated the valence of the subsequent the neutral anticipation period (duration 6920 ms). Thereafter, a photo of the participant was shown (5940 ms). The cues were simple graphical symbols, which required no intensive working memory component.  appraisal period or  The instructions for self-appraisal were as follows: ‘‘The cues indicate the valence of the following selfappraisal period. Each self-appraisal period is followed by a photo of you; each photo is shown triply, once after each condition. The conditions are randomly mixed. In the positive condition, please make yourself aware of positive appraisals for instance by telling them to yourself (in your mind) such as ‘I am a good person, I am capable of XX (personal strengths which you can make yourself aware of prior the task), I am great, I am a cool/nice person, I will manage things’. In the negative condition, please make yourself aware of negative appraisals supported for instance by telling them to yourself, such as ‘I am a looser, I will never manage this, I am incompetent’ or similar negative things. Please use appraisals as you would or do tell yourself in your own words. It can be helpful if you make yourself aware of concrete autobiographical contents of such sayings or experiences of competence or incompetence for the respective conditions. In the neutral condition, do nothing speciﬁc. Each self-appraisal period and the neutral period, is followed by a photo of you. Please stop the self-appraisal and self-talk and simply regard the photo.’’ The participants were given this instruction as printout and did a short version of the task prior scanning. They were instructed to prepare themselves for the respective conditions. The task was programed using Presentation, Neurobehavioral Systems, USA.  Many studies used self-reports of mood or arousal during the respective conditions to monitor subjective eﬀects of the task conditions. Due to the rather implicit eﬀect of the self-appraisal, which could be referred to as a sort of priming prior to the perception of the pictures of the participants themselves, a rating or reaction task could have had marked eﬀects on the priming, even abolishing the eﬀect on the perception by adding a selfperceiving or self-focused response. Therefore, we intentionally refrained from implementing any behavioral components during the task. Instead, participants were  perceived  no  regarding  diﬀerences  interviewed after the task on their ability to follow the task, diﬀerences subjective the positive and negative conditions pleasantness of (participants regarding vividness, the positive condition was mentioned as more pleasant by about 70% of the participants, the others reported no subjectively perceived diﬀerence), and subjective diﬃculties and even aversion to any of the conditions (reported by no participant). Furthermore, we qualitatively collected speciﬁc experiences (thoughts, memories, and emotions) during the task. Participants were also interviewed on the pictures of themselves (liking/disliking, speciﬁc thoughts). All subjects conﬁrmed that they had been awake and that they were able to follow the instructions. The pictures of the subjects themselves were perceived as neutral to positive (question: ‘‘How did you perceive the pictures of yourself?’’ – responses varying between ‘‘ok’’ and ‘‘I liked speciﬁcally picture XY’’). The participants reported no additional emotions and memories than those related to the instructed events, particularly no memories and emotions related to childhood or possibly traumatic events. Additionally, vigilance and perception of the stimuli, we inspected the activity in the primary visual cortex during the presentation period in each subject to ensure visual activation; for example, least a markedly closed eyes would have led to at reduced activity in V1. Two of the subjects were excluded after data acquisition due to severe signal artifacts identiﬁed in the imaging results.  to control  for  Image acquisition  Imaging was performed with a 3.0-T GE Signa HD Scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, 8-channel head coil). Echo-planar imaging (EPI) was performed for the fMRI (repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) 1980/32 ms; 22 sequential axial slices, whole brain, 3.5-mm slice thickness, 1-mm gap, which resulted in a voxel size of 3.125  3.125  4.5 mm, matrix 64  64, FOV 200 mm, ﬂip angle 70°). We obtained 584 volumes for each subject with 16 volumes per trial plus eight proceeding volumes. The four volumes were discarded to allow for T2 ﬁrst equilibration 3D T1 weighted anatomical volumes were acquired (TR/TE 1  1  1 mm 9.9/2.9 ms; matrix resolution, axial orientation) for co-registration with the functional data. Furthermore, the T2-weighted images acquired in parallel with the EPI sequence enabled the detection of potential T2-sensitive brain abnormalities.

The individual 3D data sets were transformed into the Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) with a resulting voxel size of 3  3  3 mm3 and were spatially smoothed with an 8-mm Gaussian kernel for subsequent group analysis. Six predictors, which represent the three valence conditions – positive (ps), negative (ng), neutral (nt) – together with self-appraisal (sap) and perception after the respective appraisal (perc, resulting conditions: ps-sap, ng-sap, nt, ps-perc, ng-perc, and nt-perc), were used to build the design matrix. The individual single trials with the most severe fMRI signal artifacts (e.g., due to head movements or more than a threefold mean signal change in amplitude with resulting outliers of beta weights) were manually eliminated. The periods were modeled as epochs using a two-gamma hemodynamic response function adapted to the applied period duration provided by BrainVoyager. The fMRI data analysis, which was based on the linear model, consisted of the following steps: general ﬁrst, the ﬁxed eﬀects analyses were separately calculated for each subject for the six conditions, which resulted in the summary images. The summary images were subjected to second level group analyses within the anatomically predeﬁned regions of interest (ROIs). Furthermore, whole-brain 3D statistical parametric maps were calculated for the group using separate subject predictors.  Our focus of interest in this study was a network of predeﬁned brain regions involved in the processing of emotional valence and arousal and furthermore selfreference that included the amygdala, anterior insula, ventral striatum, ACC, DLPFC and DMPFC. According to the anatomical size of the respective structures, we selected for the amygdala and ventral striatum cubic ROIs of 3  3  3 functional voxel (edge length 9 mm, volume 721 mm3). For the larger cortical regions of the insula, ACC, DLPFC and DMPFC, ROIs were constructed using 4  4  4 functional voxel (edge length 12  12  12 mm, volume 1728 mm3 each). The ROIs were placed according to the Talairach Client (Lancaster et al., 2000) and prior studies (DMPFC/ DLPFC: Northoﬀ et al., 2006; Herwig et al., 2010b; anterior insula: Craig, 2009; Paulus and Stein, 2010; ventral striatum: McClure et al., 2004; Heimer and Van Hoesen, 2006), the coordinates of the centers are given in Table 1. Of these ROIs the mean beta-weights of the six conditions were extracted. With these beta-weights we computed one-factorial ANOVAs with beta-weight per ROI as dependent factor and condition as independent factor. Our hypotheses focused on (a) the eﬀect of diﬀerent valences of self-appraisal and (b) the eﬀect of valenced appraisal on the perception of a photo of oneself. Therefore, we computed two ANOVAs, one on the valence of self-appraisal and one on the photoperception. In those ROIs in which the main eﬀect was signiﬁcant (p < .05) we computed the contrasts of the valence-conditions against each other, applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Age and gender were entered as covariates of no interest. ANOVAs were computed using SPSS 20.  52  A. B. Bru¨ hl et al. / Neuroscience 265 (2014) 48–59  Table 1.

In addition,  to detect signiﬁcant other regions not covered by the theory-based ROIs, we performed whole-brain random eﬀect analyses on the contrasts ‘ps-sap > ng-sap’ and ‘ps-perc > ng-perc’. A Monte Carlo simulation (Goebel et al., 2006), was used to correct for multiple comparisons: maps with a voxelwise threshold of p < .005 were submitted to a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate cluster-level false positive rates, yielding after 10,000 iterations a minimum cluster size threshold of 7 voxel of 3  3  3 mm (189 mm3), corresponding to a corrected cluster-level p < .01.  RESULTS  The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the anatomically deﬁned ROIs (Table 1) revealed signiﬁcant eﬀects of the main eﬀect of self-appraisal in the bilateral amygdala, bilateral DMPFC and ACC, bilateral anterior insula, left DLPFC and right ventral striatum. Within these ROIs, the analysis of the single contrasts revealed signiﬁcant activations in the contrast ‘positive vs. neutral selfappraisal’ in the bilateral amygdala (Fig. 2), ACC (Fig. 3A), DMPFC (Fig. 3B) and ventral striatum, left DLPFC (Fig. 3D) and left anterior insula (Fig. 3C, trend in self-appraisal compared to neutral activated bilateral DMPFC and ACC, left DLPFC and right-sided anterior insula (trend left-sided).

DISCUSSION  This study investigated neural circuits associated with short manipulations of self-worth by negative and positive self-appraisal, and the eﬀects of the selfappraisal on the subsequent perception of photos of the participants. Positive self-appraisal was associated with stronger activity than negative appraisal in the left amygdala in the ROI analysis, and additionally in the whole-brain analysis in ACC and left temporal cortex. Negative self-appraisal induced stronger activation in the occipital brain regions in the whole-brain analysis. Short positive manipulations of self-worth had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the subsequent perception of photos of oneself, whereas negative manipulation activated particularly the insular and parietal brain regions during photo perception. DMPFC and left DLPFC were active during all emotionally valenced conditions compared to neutral.  These results are in line with the ‘top-down’ or ‘aﬀective’ model of state self-esteem (or self-worth, Brown and Marshall, 2006).The included healthy subjects applied short manipulations of self-worth by negative and positive self-appraisal which induced activations in brain regions involved in self-reference (particularly DMPFC, e.g. van der Meer et al., 2010; Murray et al., 2012) and self-reﬂection (Esslen et al., 2008) and the processing of emotional information insula, and ventral striatum, Pessoa and (amygdala,  Adolphs, 2010; Lindquist et al., 2012), both in the hypothesis-driven ROI analysis and in the whole-brain analysis. Similarly, dorsal ACC activation was observed in both self-appraisal conditions, but not in the more passive perception conditions. This is in line with recent interpretations of the ACC as mediating cognitive control or cognitive eﬀort (Shenhav et al., 2013) or motivating behavior (Holroyd and Yeung, 2012). On the one hand, this may reﬂect an increased cognitive eﬀort associated with the self-evaluation and self-appraisal compared to the very plain neutral condition. On the other hand, dACC activation could also reﬂect a preparation for a possible conﬂicting outcome or uncertainty (Carter and van Veen, 2007; Bach and Dolan, 2012). One more ventrally located portion of the ACC showed more activation in the whole-brain analysis during positive versus negative self-appraisal. This ﬁnding is in line with the ventral-dorsal diﬀerentiation of ACC subregions between more emotional functions in ventral-rostral and more cognitive functions in dorsal regions (Bush et al., 2000).  evident  after  negative  The eﬀect of self-appraisal on brain activation during the subsequent perception of pictures of oneself was self-appraisal particularly compared to positive self-appraisal in the bilateral insular cortex and brain regions involved in visual processing and attention (cuneus/precuneus (Tomasi and Volkow, 2011), and inferior parietal lobe (Ptak, 2012)). In the following, we will discuss the results of the conditions separately.

Due to methodological reasons we abstained from collecting mood ratings during the task. The neural level could make a case for such positive eﬀects of positive self-appraisal on mood, however, with the slight limitation of possible reverse inference: During positive manipulation of self-esteem, the current study detected activations in the bilateral amygdala and ventral striatum. The amygdala has been strongly associated with the processing of emotional information, particularly emotional arousal, signiﬁcance and salience (LeDoux, 2000; Phelps et al., 2001; Vuilleumier et al., 2001; Baxter and Murray, 2002; Anderson et al., 2003;  Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010; Disner et al., 2011), with no clear association with either positive or negative valence independent of arousal (e.g. Cunningham et al., 2008; Sergerie et al., 2008; Fusar-Poli et al., 2009). The stronger activation of the amygdala during positive selfappraisal to more emotional arousal.  in this study could point  The ventral striatum, however, has been linked more closely to positive stimuli and even reward: electrical stimulation of the ventral striatum in animal studies and dopaminergic stimulation has been associated with a highly rewarding eﬀect (Ikemoto and Panksepp, 1999), and fMRI studies in humans have linked the ventral striatal region to reward anticipation or prediction (e.g. Schultz, 1999; O’Doherty et al., 2002, 2003; Fiorillo et al., 2003; McClure et al., 2004) and reward delivery  A.

Interestingly,  there were no brain regions where positive self-appraisal inﬂuenced brain activity during the perception of photos of oneself. This eﬀect could be interpreted either as an already at baseline existing positive bias toward oneself in these healthy participants (Pyszczynski et al., 2004; Leary, 2007) or as a lack of ongoing induction or priming eﬀects of positive selfappraisal, at least on the neural level.

However, an involvement of ventral striatum in the anticipation of aversive stimuli (Jensen et al., 2003), disgust and fear (Klucken et al., 2012), pain (Gear and Levine, 2011) and aversive conditioning (Pohlack et al., 2012). There is an ongoing debate on the nucleus accumbens as a behaviorally activating system which motivates the individual to either approach or withdraw from an object (Salamone and Correa, 2012). These motivational aspects could play a role in our paradigm, particularly with the more wanted positive self(and other-) appraisal condition.  to not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent  Negative self-appraisal had a rather speciﬁc eﬀect on brain activation during the perception of photos of oneself after negative self-appraisal. These eﬀects could be observed in the left DLPFC, DMPFC and bilaterally in the anterior insula ROIs. The whole-brain analysis additionally revealed activation in the right DLPFC, left PCC and bilateral parietal regions. Negative selfappraisal itself, however, was associated with similar activations as positive self-appraisal, albeit generally lower from the neutral condition. This lower activation in negative conditions has been shown before in similar self-referential situations (Sharot et al., 2007). Therefore, is even more interesting that the negative self-appraisal had such a marked eﬀect, comparable to a priming eﬀect onto the processing of the subsequent picture of oneself. This eﬀect to the behavioral similar is inﬂuences of negative mood induction on cognitive and self-referential biases (Brown and Mankowski, 1993; Mathews and Mackintosh, 2000) as well as priming eﬀects of generally negative, but not positive, stimuli on subsequent perception (Suslow et al., 2013). These  it  56  A. B. Bru¨ hl et al. / Neuroscience 265 (2014) 48–59  activations overlap grossly with those found consistently in studies on rumination in healthy subjects (e.g. Denson et al., 2008; Cooney et al., 2010: ACC, bilateral insula, posterior cingulate, DMPFC, DLPFC, Precuneus) as well as in patients with major depression during rumination versus distraction (Cooney et al., 2010: ACC, insula, DLPFC, MPFC, precuneus, inferior parietal lobe and occipital regions). This could represent a neural correlate of sensitivity against negative self- (and other-) appraisals which are known as a vulnerability factor for depression (Beck, 1967, 1987; Disner et al., 2011). Within networks involved in the processing of negative emotional information, particularly with a self-referential aspect, the DLPFC has been regarded as a ‘connector hub’ and attractor for negative and even depressive cognitions (Yuste et al., 2005; Sporns et al., 2007), whereas the MPFC could refer to the self-referential context of the pictures (cortical midline structure, e.g. Northoﬀ et al., 2006). However, the DLPFC has also been implicated in self-regulation (Garavan et al., 2002; Kerns et al., 2004; Heatherton and Wagner, 2011) and emotion regulation (e.g. meta-analyses: Buhle et al., in press; Kohn et al., 2014). Its increased activation during negative self-appraisal could therefore also reﬂect counterregulation valenced manipulation, which would be the self-preserving and re-balancing reaction in healthy subjects. The DLPFC activation might then be counterbalancing the priming eﬀect seen in the DMPFC during the perception after negative reappraisal.  negatively  against  the  Altogether, our data support a priming eﬀect of negative self-appraisal onto the subsequent perception period, with activations similar to rumination. These ﬁndings’ possible implications for psychotherapy are discussed below.  Limitations  is diﬃcult  this engagement  The current study included no behavioral measures, which can be regarded as a limitation. There was no direct control whether and how intensively participants were actively engaged in the self-appraisal conditions. However, to measure without interfering with the study’s goal. We indeed regard this ‘purity’ rather as strength than as weakness of this study: Compared to other studies using external (thus more controllable) stimuli this study relied on the individual’s own self-appraising wording and inner speech. To control for this would in some way have to disclose these highly private thoughts. This meant rather could participants’ engagement and could additionally have added a distracting eﬀect. Furthermore, any cognitive and motor reaction could have strongly disturbed the implicit inﬂuence of the self-appraisal on the subsequent perception of the photos of the participants. In addition, our group and other researchers have shown reliable results using purely mental interventions without continuous external stimulation, motor reactions or other behavioral control measures (e.g. Herwig et al., 2007, 2010a,b, 2012; Bru¨ hl et al., 2011; Michl et al., 2014) or implemented simple button press reactions only to  deteriorated  have  the  conﬁrm that participants were awake and had read the instructions (e.g. Finger et al., 2006). If the participants in our study had not at least roughly complied with the instruction and therefore done something alike and consistent over the conditions, we would not have expected such strong and consistent eﬀects at the neural level which corresponded in hypothesis-driven a priori ROIs and the whole-brain analysis. The subjects’ self-report after scanning conﬁrmed a stable and consistent behavior.  Implications for self-esteem and emotion regulation  Measuring the psychological eﬀects of short-term interventions by psychometric measures is diﬃcult and can be intermingled with other factors (Standage et al., 2010), resulting in controversies about the eﬀectiveness of such interventions. Our data provide a neurobiological basis for the psychological suggestion that praising oneself in a positive or a negative way may have respective eﬀects in the moment and perhaps also shortly after. We found this eﬀect although our intervention lasted only 12 s, compared to the Velten mood manipulation procedure (Velten, 1968), which used 60, or in modiﬁed version at least 25 sentences of the respective valence for induction of mood changes (Schare and Lisman, 1984).  Our results on the neurobiological level can provide for further research into such eﬀects on the support psychological and the neurobiological level. Particularly the discrepancy between stronger eﬀects of positive self-appraisal during the appraisal itself and the rather stronger ongoing eﬀect of negative self-appraisal after the appraisal could be of general and possibly clinical interest. The priming eﬀect could even be stronger in patients suﬀering from aﬀective disorders, which have a reduced optimistic and positive bias (Mathews and MacLeod, subjects (Schacter and Addis, 2007; Gotlib and Hamilton, 2008). If replicated, the results of the study could ﬁrst support a more frequent use of positive self-appraisal to stimulate associated neural circuits and prompt the functional neuroplastic processes. Second, it could encourage therapists to be very sensitive toward negative selfappraisal and the possibly associated priming eﬀects, and to increase the use of cognitive bias modiﬁcation techniques in particularly vulnerable patients (Salemink and van den Hout, 2010; Hallion and Ruscio, 2011).  compared  healthy  2005)  to  CONCLUSION  In summary, this study shows the neural correlates of the subjects’ own positive and negative self-appraisal and the eﬀects of self-appraisal on the neural circuits involved in the perception of a photo of the subject itself, with a stronger eﬀect of negative self-appraisal.

However, in natural environments, planning over multiple possible future states incurs prohibitive computational costs. To represent plans efﬁciently, states can be clustered hierarchically into ‘‘contexts’’. For example, representing a journey through a subway network as a succession of individual states (stations) is more costly than encoding a sequence of contexts (lines) and context switches (line changes). Here, using functional brain imaging, we asked humans to perform a planning task in a virtual subway network. Behavioral analyses revealed that humans executed a hierarchically organized plan. Brain activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and premotor cortex scaled with the cost of hierarchical plan representation and unique neural signals in these regions signaled contexts and context switches. These results suggest that humans represent hierarchical plans using a network of caudal prefrontal structures.  INTRODUCTION  By forming and executing plans, humans can engage in complex behaviors such as preparing a cup of coffee or organizing a trip to London. When asked to perform multistep tasks such as these, patients with lesions to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) often exhibit disordered action sequences that fail to achieve the speciﬁed goal (Owen et al., 1990; Shallice, 1982; Shallice and Burgess, 1991), and hippocampal patients have difﬁculty imagining the future states entailed (Schacter et al., 2012). Moreover, functional neuroimaging has conﬁrmed the involvement of human prefrontal and limbic structures in forming and executing plans, particularly in spatial environments (Howard et al., 2014; Schacter and Addis, 2007; Unterrainer and Owen, 2006). Nevertheless, linking these macroscopic neural ﬁndings to the underlying computational mechanisms that subserve planning remains an open challenge for psychologists and neuroscientists. Planning is often described as mental exploration of a network of interlinked, internally represented episodes (or ‘‘states’’). Ac cording to one conception, future states belong to a decision ‘‘tree’’ in which each node is a decision point and each branch a possible response. Plans are representations of trajectories through the tree, selected on the basis of their long-term cumulative outcome (Daw et al., 2005, 2011; Huys et al., 2012; Russell and Norvig, 1995). Computer-based algorithms have successfully exploited this strategy to achieve expert levels of performance in board games such as chess and weiqi (Go) (Silver et al., 2016). However, because the number of possible action sequences grows exponentially with each additional step in the planning horizon, this approach is computationally intractable in many natural environments (Gershman et al., 2015). For example, a visitor would probably not plan a trip to London by envisaging every unique interim step en route to the destination, but might rather imagine attaining only a subset of key states, such as reaching an airport or other transport hub.  In machine learning and computational neuroscience, it is widely recognized that the computational demand associated with planning can be reduced by exploiting hierarchical structure in the environment, with states clustered into larger ‘‘contexts’’ (Badre et al., 2010; Botvinick et al., 2009; Koechlin and Jubault, 2006; Sutton and Barto, 1998). To understand how a hierarchical representation may alleviate the computational burden of planning, consider a metropolitan rail (subway) network, in which stations (i.e., states, e.g., King’s Cross and Oxford Circus) are organized into lines (i.e., contexts, e.g., the Victoria Line; see Figure 1A). Unlike planning in a ‘‘ﬂat’’ (non-hierarchical) environment, plans formed in a hierarchical environment need not specify each and every state linking the current position and goal. Rather, it is sufﬁcient to identify the current context and the (termination) conditions that allow the next context to be reached; for example, when planning a journey from Marble Arch to King’s Cross on the London Underground, one should ‘‘take the Central Line to Oxford Circus, and from there, switch to the Victoria Line’’. Humans seem to represent locations hierarchically in spatial memory: for example, we have a bias to judge cities belonging to a common region (e.g., Nevada) as geographically closer than those crossing a region boundary (Newcombe and Liben, 1982; Stevens and Coupe, 1978). Regionalization may also inﬂuence navigational strategy: during wayﬁnding, humans prefer routes that permit a context boundary to be crossed earlier rather than later (Wiener and Mallot, 2003). In machine learning, states that offer privileged access to a new context (such as Oxford Circus allowing access to the Victoria Line) are considered ‘‘bottlenecks,’’ and hierarchical  Neuron 90, 893–903, May 18, 2016 ª 2016 The Authors.

Here, thus, we taught participants to navigate a novel subway network in which stations (states; e.g., Mandela and Budapest) were organized hierarchically into lines (contexts) deﬁned by their color (Figure 1B). Following training, participants were asked to complete journeys within the network without viewing the map, pressing keys to move from one station to another. We analyzed behavior and fMRI data in order to determine  894 Neuron 90, 893–903, May 18, 2016  Figure 1.

Each node from left (start state, shown by the robot) to right shows a possible state (i.e., station) that could be visited. The ﬂag indicates the destination station. A hierarchical policy allows the agent to ‘‘chunk’’ the maze into contexts (here, a red line and a blue line). This in turn reduces the cost of planning and plan representation.

The robot shows the start point, and the ﬂag shows the destination station.  whether humans represented plans in a hierarchical fashion (over lines or contexts) or a ﬂat fashion (over stations or states). On the neural level, an extensive literature has implicated both the medial and lateral PFC in planning on multistep decision tasks such as the Tower of London (Unterrainer and Owen, 2006), but the relative contribution of these different regions remains unclear. Some studies have found that the BOLD signal in dorsolateral PFC scales with the number of moves required to attain goal state (van den Heuvel et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2006), but neural structures encoding hierarchical plan complexity have yet to be identiﬁed. One theoretical perspective has suggested that the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) may play a particular role in representing contextual information for future behavior (Holroyd and Yeung, 2012). During passive observation of trajectories through a structured environment, the dmPFC is less active at bottleneck states (Schapiro et al., 2013), but by contrast, a more caudal medial prefrontal region shows a positive ‘‘pseudo-reward’’ signal when a subgoal is attained (Ribas-Fernandes et al., 2011). It thus remains unclear how the medial and lateral PFC might contribute to hierarchical planning.  To preview our ﬁndings, we identiﬁed two frontal cortical regions that encoded the cost of representing a hierarchical plan: a bilateral anterior premotor region and the dmPFC. These  regions also became differentially active at bottleneck states (‘‘exchange’’ stations, where participants could switch from one context to another). Using multivariate analyses, we found that the dmPFC additionally encoded or monitored the current context (i.e., the subway line that was currently being taken), a key quantity that is required for executing a hierarchical plan. By contrast, the rostromedial PFC and hippocampus encoded the proximity to a goal state. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that during planning, humans encode the subway network and formulate plans in a hierarchical fashion.  RESULTS  Task Summary The task is depicted in Figure 1C. Each journey began at a pseudo-randomly chosen station (see Experimental Procedures). On each trial, the names of the destination and current stations were shown, and participants pressed one of four buttons (north, south, east, or west) to move to an adjacent station, which was then shown on the next trial. Their goal was to navigate through the subway map from the start station to the destination station (these successive trials comprising a ‘‘journey’’). During an initial training session, lines were associated with colors (red, green, yellow, and blue), but at scanning, all color information was removed. Successful journeys were rewarded with ﬁnancial incentives, but there was a small, but constant, probability that journeys were ‘‘cancelled’’ on each trial and the reward was unavailable, motivating participants to make journeys in the shortest possible number of trials. Participants carried out 88.8 ± 2 journeys in total, each consisting of an average of 5.5 ± 0.06 trials. Of these, 78.3% were performed ‘‘optimally’’ (i.e., when all responses decreased the distance to goal in number of stations). Of the remainder, 15.2% contained at led participants further away from the goal; these responses were made more slowly (t19 = 7.56, p < 0.000001). Additionally, 9.0% of journeys included at least one missing response (when subjects failed to respond on time and remained in the same station as in the previous trial).  least one action that  Behavior: The Cost of Plan Representation The complexity (or description length) of representing a ﬂat (nonhierarchical) plan is proportional to the number of remaining states (here, stations) that must be traversed to reach the goal (here, destination station). By contrast, in a hierarchical plan, this cost scales with the remaining number of contexts that must be traversed for the goal to be attained. We thus began by deﬁning measures of plan complexity that might be computed by participants under ﬂat and hierarchical policies. First, we calculated, on each trial, the number of steps (stations) that remained to be traversed before the goal was reached, assuming a shortest path trajectory (DS). This represents plan complexity under a ﬂat policy (see Figure 1D, leftmost). Next, we calculated the number of contexts that remained to be traversed before the goal was reached. Thus, if on the current trial there were only one change of context that would be required to reach the goal, this value would be 1; beyond that context switch, the value would be 0. This quantity DL indexes the cost of a hierarchical policy (Fig ure 1D, center left). Then, as a control, we computed the distance to goal in number of exchange stations to be traversed. By design, on many journeys, the shortest path involved passing through an exchange station without switching context (Figure 1D, center right). This measure, which we call DX, was thus decorrelated from DL (for details of the correlation among distance measures, see Table S3). Finally, we computed another cost, which represented the number of steps that had to be taken away from the goal (in cityblock space) in order to reach it by the shortest path. Thus, this measure, which we call the U-turn cost (or DU), was high for paths that required ‘‘doubling back’’ (Figure 1D, rightmost).  We then used linear regression to ask whether (log) response times (RTs) during navigation were sensitive to the complexity of the plan as indexed by DS, DL, DX, and DU. Critically, this analysis yielded signiﬁcant positive coefﬁcients for number of lines to goal (DL: t19 = 3.46, p = 0.003) and for the U-turn cost (DU: t19 = 4.26, p < 0.001; see Figure 2A). When these predictors competed for variance within a single regression, however, the number of stations to goal failed to predict RTs (DS: t19 = 1.26, p = 0.223), as did the number of exchange stations (DX: t19 =  0.49, p = 0.628). This ﬁnding suggests that the main costs of representing the plan were contextual or structural aspects of the subway map, rather than the number of unique steps required to reach the destination station. This supports the view that plans are formed and executed in a hierarchical fashion.  We deﬁned stations as ‘‘regular’’ (i.e., within a single line; e.g., Madrid in Figure 1B) and exchange (i.e., bottlenecks, occurring at the intersection between lines, e.g., Clinton). Moreover, responses were classiﬁed as either stay (i.e., travel in the same direction as the previous step) or switch (i.e., change the direction of travel). These factors were orthogonal in our paradigm, because regular stations sometimes required a direction switch, as when a single line turned a corner (e.g., Kathmandu in Figure 1B), but participants could also pass through exchange stations without switching response (e.g., when passing through Moscow en route from Winfrey to Bern). This feature of our design thus allowed us to further include, in the above regression, separate binary predictors encoding station type (exchange versus regular) and response type (switch versus stay). We observed a main effect of station type (exchange > regular; t19 = 3.40, p = 0.003) and of direction (switch > stay; t19 = 7.92, p < 0.001). The interaction between station type and response type was not signiﬁcant (t19 = 1.05, p = 0.309). Mean RTs in each condition are plotted in Figure S1.  Neural Cost of Plan Representation Next, we sought to identify in the brain imaging data the neural costs of representing ﬂat or hierarchical plans. In this analysis and all that follow, all reported results survive correction for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR) with an alpha of p < 0.05, unless otherwise noted. We built a design matrix (GLM1) with regressors encoding the various indices of distance to goal introduced above (DS, DL, DX, and DU; Figure 2C). Examples of how these distances were computed are shown in Figure 1D. Regressing this design matrix against BOLD data, we found that a dmPFC (BA8/32) responded  Neuron 90, 893–903, May 18, 2016 895  B  F  A  C  D  E  lower)  in the lateral (sagittal view;  Figure 2.

The dots correspond to individual subjects. The lines are to best linear ﬁts for signiﬁcant (red) and non-signiﬁcant (gray) correlations, respectively. The signiﬁcant regions within a circle survived multiple comparisons correction.  Previous neuroimaging studies have noted that BOLD signals in the rostrolateral PFC (rlPFC) scale with the number of moves that are required to solve the Tower of London task (van den Heuvel et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2006), equivalent to our DS measure. To permit direct comparison with past studies, we created a new GLM (GLM2) that included only DS (alongside other nuisance quantities; see Experimental Procedures), omitting the distance regressors in units of lines, exchange stations, or the U-turn cost. Consistent with previous work, this analysis identiﬁed not only the premotor cortex (PMC), but also a portion of bilateral rlPFC  (left:  42, 32, 34; t19 = 7.87, p < 0.000001 and right: 42, 40, 34; t19 = 4.81, p < 0.0001; see Figure 2C). Plotting the average beta parameters across the cohort for DS and DL conﬁrmed that the PMC, but not the rlPFC, encoded the cost of a hierarchical plan, as demonstrated by a region (PMC and rlPFC) 3 distance (DS and DL) interaction (F1,19 = 4.71, p < 0.05; see Figure 2B).  Proximity to Goal Consistent with previous ﬁndings (Howard et al., 2014), using GLM1, we also observed a signal that reﬂected a negative correlation with distance in stations to goal (DS) in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC, peak: 10, 48,  6; t19 = 5.80, p < 0.00001; in other  words, this region became more active the closer to the goal). In this region, distance was encoded in units of stations only, with no evidence for encoding of hierarchical distance (Figure 2D).  positively to the cost of plan representation in units of both lines  (peak:  6, 8, 58; t19 = 5.21, p < 0.0001) and the U-turn cost (peak:  2, 12, 46; t19 = 5.63, p < 0.00001). Critically, in GLM1 (when all  four regressors competed to explain variance in BOLD activity) no dmPFC voxels were sensitive to the distance to goal in terms of number of stations.  In the lateral PFC, we observed a similar pattern of BOLD signals in an anterior premotor region (premotor cortex) that straddled BA6 and BA8, where BOLD activity scaled with DL (left peak:  26,  8, 54; t19 = 6.58, p < 0.000001 and right peak: 30, 4, 66; t19 = 4.99, p < 0.0001) and DU (left peak:  26, 4, 54; t19 = 6.51, p < 0.000001 and right peak: 26, 8, 46; t19 = 6.30, p < 0.000001). Here, we also observed an effect of distance in number of stations, DS (left peak:  22,  8, 50; t19 = 6.62, p < 0.000001 and right peak: 30, 4, 58; t19 = 6.39, p < 0.000001). Notably, the number of exchange stations between the current position and the goal (DX) failed to show any consistent effect at the group level. In other words, these regions encoded the cost of representing a plan in units that reﬂected the structure of the subway map, over and above any encoding of the distance to goal.  896 Neuron 90, 893–903, May 18, 2016  A  B  C  D  regular  Figure 3.

Including only DS (GLM2) identiﬁed a number of other regions, including the hippocampus, where BOLD signals have previously been found to scale with distance to goal during navigation (Howard et al., 2014). In our task, the hippocampus reﬂected distance to goal bilaterally in the same direction as the vmPFC (Figure 2E). A full range of regions that correlated with each of these distance estimates is reported in Tables S1 and S2.  Correlation of Neural and Behavioral Costs across the Cohort Next, we aimed to understand the relationship between the neural and behavioral effects so far observed (see Figure 2F). For each measure of planning cost (DS, DL, DX, and DU), we calculated the correlation across the cohort of participants between its inﬂuence on RT (regression coefﬁcient from Figure 2A) and its inﬂuence on BOLD signals in (1) the PMC and (2) the dmPFC. We found the correlation was signiﬁcant in dmPFC for both distance in number of stations (DS: R = 0.6, p < 0.005) and in number of line changes (DL: R = 0.39, p < 0.05). However, neither of these correlations was signiﬁcant in the PMC (DS: R =  0.05, p = 0.57 and DL: R =  0.07, p = 0.379). No brain-behavior correlations were observed in either region for DX or DU. However, we did observe a correlation between the behavioral cost of DU and the encoding of DU in a dlPFC region shown in Figure S4 (DU: R = 0.33, p < 0.05 one-tailed).  Neural Signals Associated with Bottleneck States The analyses described above suggest that both dmPFC and PMC encoded the hierarchical cost of representing a plan, over and above any cost of plan representation computed in units of discrete states. Next, we investigated neural signals in these regions more closely, by plotting the activity that accompanied the moment in which a bottleneck state occurred, when participants were offered the opportunity to switch from one context to another. We once again capitalized on the factorial design of our task, asking if there were unique neural signals that varied with station type (exchange > regular, now including all trials; Figure 3B). This analysis also included a regressor encoding DS, as well as a further nuisance predictor that signaled whether the action chosen was optimal or not (GLM2).  We observed increases in BOLD signals associated with exchange stations in both the dmPFC (peak: 6, 16, 46; t19 = 4.09, p < 0.001) and PMC, overlapping with the region described above (left peak:  26, 8, 54; t19 = 7.24, p < 0.000001 and right peak: 26, 12, 54; t19 = 6.56, p < 0.00001). Across the subject cohort, the strength of this latter neural effect predicted the RT difference between exchange and regular stations (r = 0.40, p < 0.04), but not between switch and stay trials (p = 0.70). A further effect of exchange > regular stations was observed in a more anterior prefrontal region, in bilateral BA 46 (left peak:   42, 24, 30; t19 = 4.48, p < 0.0001 and right peak: 46, 32, 22; t19 = 5.38, p < 0.0001).  Next, we plotted how the BOLD signal varied on those regular stations that both preceded and followed an exchange or an elbow station. A brain region encoding the hierarchical representation of a plan might be expected to show tonically higher BOLD signals in the trials preceding an exchange station (where the cost of plan representation in units of lines remains high), followed by a reduction immediately after context switch (where the computational burden is reduced). In Figure 3A, we plot the BOLD signal in the PMC region (extracted from the main effect of type of station) on regular stations that precede and succeed a context switch (green lines). An elevated BOLD signal is visible on those trials preceding a context switch, after which it drops off sharply (comparison between preceding and succeeding: t19 = 3.24, p < 0.003). Of note, a similar drop is not observed when the same analysis is conducted on stations that precede or succeed an exchange station without a context switch (purple lines; p > 0.9) and only a modest drop follows an elbow station (t19 = 1.87, p < 0.05, one tailed). These effects were qualiﬁed by the interaction of type of station and type of response on the difference of signal (preceding and following) around each condition: F1,19 = 5.44, p < 0.04. In other words, the average BOLD signal in PMC observed was higher on trials before than after a context switch, consistent with a hierarchical representation of the plan. We additionally found a main effect of type of response: F1,19 = 4.61, p < 0.05, indicating that participants also anticipated making a response switch. Signals from the dmPFC followed a similar pattern, although the interaction failed  Neuron 90, 893–903, May 18, 2016 897  A  B  C  D  Figure 4.

Neural Signals Accompanying Response Switch and Context Switch Behavioral data indicated that there was a unique cost incurred when participants switched context, i.e., at exchange stations requiring a response switch. In the fMRI data, we observed a comparable interaction between type of station and response switch in a cluster of voxels straddling the amygdala and puta men (left peak:  26, 0,  10; t19 = 4.46, p < 0.001 and right peak: 22, 4,  14; t19 = 5.20, p < 0.0001), as well as an extrastriate region on the lingual gyrus (peak: 26,  68,  6; t19 = 5.16, p <  0.0001), corresponding to area V4 where responses to color are often observed (Zeki and Marini, 1998). Plotting parameter estimates for these regions showed that this interaction was driven by higher BOLD signals for those trials where participants switched from one context to another (Figure 3C). However, we interpret these results with caution, because they failed to reach the threshold required for correction using an FDR threshold. Finally, we also observed strong activations in the parietal cortex that predicted whether participants switched direction or not (left  peak:  38,  32, 46; t19 = 10.8, p < 0.000000001 and right peak: 54,  24, 34; t19 = 8.39, p < 0.0000001; Figure 3D).  Encoding of Current Context To execute a hierarchical plan, an agent must be able to identify and represent the current context, in addition to the current state (i.e., on the London Underground, to know that one is on the Victoria Line, not just that one is at Green Park station). We thus used a multivariate analysis technique known as representational similarity analysis (RSA) to identify brain regions in which the patterns of BOLD signal over voxels was more similar across runs within a single subway line than between two  different lines (using unsmoothed data; see Experimental Procedures for details; Figure 4A). In the scanner, no indication was given as to the subway line currently being visited, and so any signiﬁcant voxels must reﬂect an abstract encoding of the context from memory. In conjunction with a whole-brain ‘‘searchlight’’ approach, this analysis once again identiﬁed the dmPFC as a region where the current context was represented  (peak  10, 8, 54; t19 = 7.49, p < 0.000001; Figure 4B). No evi dence for context encoding in the PMC was found, although evidence was found in other regions, including more anterior  portions of the PFC in BA9 (left peak:  30, 44, 34; t19 = 5.32, p < 0.0001 and right peak: 34, 44, 30; t19 = 4.9, p < 0.001).  The analyses above indicated that the dmPFC encodes distance to goal in units of lines and U-turns. It could be, thus, that the pattern encoding of this quantity may depend on the current line, providing evidence for a distinct computational cost within each context. We thus repeated our RSA, but using not the raw BOLD signal observed at each station, but the parametric encoding of distance to goal (in stations). The pattern of encoding of distance to goal was also more similar within lines than it was between lines in the dmPFC (2, 20, 54; t19 = 5.38, p < 0.0001); it is shown in Figure 4C.  RSA can yield spurious results when trials assigned to each category are not fully temporally decorrelated, and so we conducted this analysis between runs (e.g., measured the similarity between line a on run1 and line b on run 2). We additionally conducted a control analysis in which the assignments between stations and lines were shufﬂed; this yielded no signiﬁcant results (Figure 4D).  Finally, subway lines contained long straight sections, and so we were concerned that RSA of context might have captured similarity associated with travel in a common direction, unrelated to context per se. To test this, we conducted another RSA using the same approach, but searched for regions where multivoxel  898 Neuron 90, 893–903, May 18, 2016  patterns were more similar within than between directions (north, south, east, and west). No activations were observed in the medial PFC, but a large cluster of signiﬁcant voxels was found in the left motor cortex (Figure S2).  DISCUSSION  The behavior of humans and other animals is controlled at least in part by a ‘‘model-based’’ control system that learns the structure of the world and organizes sequential behavior in pursuit of future goals (Daw et al., 2005; Dickinson and Balleine, 2002; Dolan and Dayan, 2013; Schoenbaum et al., 2009; Tolman, 1948). Recent work has begun to address the neural and computational substrates underlying the model-based decision-making by constructing ‘‘two-step’’ decision tasks in which cached state-action values and explicit forward search strategies make opposing predictions about behavior and brain activity (Daw et al., 2011; Gla¨ scher et al., 2010; Wunderlich et al., 2012). However, these studies sidestep one key theoretical challenge associated with modelbased approaches, namely, how to organize behavior over multiple future states without incurring a prohibitive computational cost. Human cognition has evolved to meet this challenge, as exempliﬁed by our ability to form and follow plans over multiple timescales, for example when ﬁnding an efﬁcient route to run a series of errands, or envisaging a future career path and taking steps toward its fulﬁllment. Although we have known for decades that planning involves the PFC, to date, very little has been revealed about the computational mechanisms that unfold in these regions during plan formation and execution.  Here, we drew upon a framework that has its roots in cognitive psychology (Miller et al., 1960; Norman and Shallice, 1986), but has most recently inspired advances in machine intelligence (Botvinick et al., 2009; Ponsen et al., 2010). This framework proposes that the space of possible states can be organized and represented hierarchically as a series of clusters or contexts, reducing plan complexity (description length), and affording substantive increases in computational efﬁciency both at the time of plan formation and plan execution. In the current study, we tested a prediction arising from this hypothesis: that when planning in a complex environment, the cost of representing a plan will be expressed in units of context (or context switch) over and above any cost that is incurred in units of states themselves. Our key ﬁnding is that both RTs and neural activity in the caudal frontal cortex encode the cost of representing a hierarchical plan, indicating that they participate in the hierarchical organization of future behavior.  The neural costs observed were identiﬁed in two frontal regions: a dmPFC region, falling in the presupplementary motor cortex, that is often found to be sensitive to the difﬁculty (or conﬂict) incurred when making a choice (Botvinick et al., 1999), and a lateral frontal that straddles the border between the premotor and prefrontal cortices, in BA6/BA8. Both regions were also active when participants were faced with the opportunity to switch context, at an exchange station or bottleneck, consistent with the ﬁnding that the dmPFC responds to subgoal attainment (Ribas-Fernandes et al., 2011). However, across the participant  cohort, we observed reliable brain-behavior correlations in only the dmPFC, but not the PMC. In the dmPFC, the strength with which BOLD signals encoded distance to goal in units both of stations and contexts for a given subject predicted his or her corresponding RT cost for those plan complexity measures. We also found that the multivariate pattern of information in the dmPFC (but not PMC) was sufﬁcient to distinguish among contexts, even though the line that was currently visited was never explicitly displayed to participants during the scanning phase. Moreover, we were also able to distinguish context-speciﬁc representations of distance to goal in the dmPFC, as if the region encoded separate costs of planning for each individual context. One interpretation of this ﬁnding is that the dmPFC is responsible for the translating of a plan into behavior, whereas the PMC participates in maintaining the active plan over the journey. However, we note that those participants showing the strongest ﬂat cost in behavior also showed stronger encoding of this cost in dmPFC neural signals. It may be, thus, that there are some individual differences in the way that dmPFC contributes to computing the cost of planning.  More generally, our ﬁndings are consistent with the view that the dmPFC encodes a motivational signal that is extended over time (Summerﬁeld and Koechlin, 2009) and the complementary perspective that the dmPFC encodes ‘‘option’’ values under the framework of hierarchical reinforcement learning (Holroyd and Yeung, 2012). As part of a general role in monitoring the expected value of controlled behavior (Shenhav et al., 2013), the dmPFC may thus encode both the identity and value of a contextual variable over which a particular policy applies, for example, when foraging from different patches (Hayden et al., 2011; Kolling et al., 2012).  The lateral region overlaps with the superior aspect of the caudal dorsolateral PFC identiﬁed by Koechlin et al. (2003) as active when actions are selected on the basis of contextual information. The same region is labeled ‘‘pre-PMd’’ by Badre et al. (2010), who found that this region is active when action selection is contingent on a hierarchy of contingencies, rather than a ﬂat series of sensorimotor associations. In this region (as in behavior and the dmPFC signal), the BOLD signal scaled with distance to the destination station in units of context (i.e., lines), but not the metric provided by individual states (i.e., stations). Notably, no such effect was observed in more rostral regions that have previously been implicated in representing plan complexity in multistep problems such as the Tower of London task (van den Heuvel et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2006). At ﬁrst glance this ﬁnding is surprising, one might have expected more anterior regions to be responsible for representing the higher hierarchical aspects of a complex plan. However, one explanation for this ﬁnding is that during hierarchical planning, potentially complex action sequences are ‘‘compressed’’ to a small number of steps (e.g., contexts and context switches) that can then be represented in subsidiary prefrontal regions located more caudally (Koechlin and Summerﬁeld, 2007).  Interestingly, the cost of representing a plan was incurred in units of context, but not in units of response switch. This explains the previous ﬁnding that humans seek to reach a new context earlier rather than later during navigation, as doing so reduces the computational burden of plan representations (Wiener and  Neuron 90, 893–903, May 18, 2016 899  is represented as a cluster of  Mallot, 2003). This result additionally suggests that the hierarchical representation of the plan is encoded in terms of its abstract structure, rather than as a succession of macro-actions (e.g., ‘‘go straight, then go left’’). Nor was the plan encoded in terms of the number of choice points, suggesting that the state space is not chunked purely on the basis of its physical properties (e.g., in terms of segments between choice points), but in a fashion that reﬂected the more abstract structure that they were encouraged to learn during training. What remains unclear, however, is whether context interlinked perceptual states (i.e., stations on the yellow line), or as a series of macro-policies that dictate pursuit of a goal (e.g., keep going straight on until you reach a given switch point). A hint that participants relied on perceptual representation of context was provided by the ﬁnding that voxels in area V4 became active at context switches, as if participants were recalling the color of the new subway line (which was not shown to them during scanning). However, the precise nature of the information that characterizes a context remains an open question. For example, participants might have used information about the spatial organization of the map (the blue line runs from north to south or the red line is north of the green line).  line.  In the planning literature,  Moreover, both behavior and the PMC also encoded an additional ‘‘U-turn’’ cost, that indexed the extent to which plans involved doubling back toward the current location along a different it has been noted that goal-subgoal conﬂict—for example, the need to temporarily remove one disc from a peg and subsequently replace it in the Tower of London task—incurs a unique RT cost (Ward and Allport, 1997) and poses a particular problem for patients with lateral prefrontal lesions (Morris et al., 1997). Consistent with this ﬁnding, U-turn costs were visible not only in the PMC, but also in lateral prefrontal regions. The existence of a unique U-turn cost in our navigation task demonstrates that participants not only encoded plans in the subway network as a hierarchical series of contexts, but also in terms of the geometry of the map that they saw in the training session.  Although the costs of representing a ﬂat plan were minimal once variance associated with a hierarchical plan had been partialled out, there was one brain region where strong (positive) covariation with number of stations to goal was observed, the vmPFC. Previous theories have speculated that the vmPFC may be among a set of regions that tracks distance to a goal state (Holroyd and Yeung, 2012) and, indeed, the vmPFC is implicated in episodic future thinking (Schacter and Addis, 2007), and has been found to track growing expected reward in decision tasks involving sequential, interdependent choices (Tsetsos et al., 2014). The hippocampus has also previously been found to covary with proximity to goal, but only in virtual reality environments that mimic much more closely the naturalistic experience of navigation (Howard et al., 2014; Viard et al., 2011). Here, we show that the distance to goal representation is present even when current and goal state information is devoid of the rich episodic cues that we normally use to navigate. Critically, however, the hippocampus and vmPFC showed no evidence of a hierarchical signal.  Our analyses focused on the cost of ‘‘representing’’ a hierar(or ﬂat plan) as participants navigated through the  chical  900 Neuron 90, 893–903, May 18, 2016  network. This is a general index of the cost involved in maintaining and monitoring the plan, rather than of recursively searching through all possible nodes of the decision tree (for example, via a breadth- or depth-ﬁrst algorithm) or ‘‘pruning’’ of unpromising routes to a goal (Huys et al., 2012, 2015). While plan formation may have occurred mainly on presentation of the cue screen stating the start and goal stations, plans may also have been constantly updated and reformed during execution (‘‘replanning’’). Indeed, as distance to goal grows, the processing cost of these search operations will grow correspondingly. However, it is not clear that this cost would grow linearly with the number of states or contexts that must be traversed to reach a goal. One limitation of the approach taken here is that we do not have an obvious means to assess how plans are formed prior to or during navigation or to distinguish the neural mechanisms that accompany plan maintenance and monitoring from any replanning that may be occurring. We did examine BOLD signals evoked in response to the cue screen, but they did not show convincing correlations with the various distance metrics or predict the journeys that participants would follow. However, it is unclear whether this null ﬁnding is due to a lack of statistical power, owing to the limited number of such trials. Examining the costs incurred at the time of plan formation would be an interesting avenue of research for future studies.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Subjects A total of 22 healthy participants (10 female and 12 male; age 19–34, mean 25.6 years; one was the ﬁrst author of the study) were recruited into the study in accordance with local ethical guidelines. No participants reported a history of psychiatric or neurological illness, and all had normal or corrected-tonormal vision. Participants were paid £35 for participation in both a practice and a scanner session on two separate days. A monetary incentive of up to £10, proportional to performance, was added to the previous amount. There were two participants that were excluded due to poor performance on the task (more than 20% of the journeys included a move in the wrong direction during the main experiment).   , 90   , 180   , or 270  Stimuli and Task Design The same subway map was used for all participants, but the names of the stations and the colors of the lines were randomly shufﬂed, and the map was  randomly rotated by 0 (example shown in Figure 1B). Following training (see below), participants performed the main task, which involved navigating in a virtual subway environment, in the MRI scanner. Each journey involved a start station and a destination station that were randomly selected with the constraint that the journey would require at least one change of line (17.8% of journeys) or one change of direction without changing lines (10.7%) or both (71.5%). Participants navigated through the subway map by pressing buttons (see below). On each trial, there was a constant probability that the journey was cancelled, engineered such that cancellation probability was independent of the length of the optimal journey and led to approximately 50% of journeys being cancelled; cancellation probability was independent of the hierarchical aspects of the task. Overall, 52.9% of journeys were successfully completed. Each journey was rewarded with a monetary value (either one or ﬁve virtual coins, signaled during navigation), which were converted to real incentives (normalized to a maximum of £10) that were paid out as a bonus at the end of the experiment. Behavioral performance did not differ as a function of the incentives offered, so we collapsed over this factor for all analyses.  Procedure The main task is depicted in Figure 1C. Each journey began with the presentation of a cue screen for 3 s that indicated the starting point and the destination  (stations and lines). After a period of 2–5 s (jittered) of blank screen, on each of the successive trials a navigation screen was displayed for 3 s. This screen provided multiple pieces of information: the names of the current and destination stations; the line color of the destination station; the reward at stake for the current journey; the cumulative reward so far; and the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) available from the current station. Critically, no information about the current line or about the line associated with each action was shown. At each step, participants had to choose the direction they wanted to take by pressing one out of four buttons. If no key was pressed, the same station was shown again in the next step. Each navigation screen was followed by a blank screen of 1–3 s (jittered); no feedback was provided during navigation.  The journey ended either when the participant reached the destination or when the journey was cancelled. After the journey was ﬁnished or cancelled, a feedback screen informed whether the destination had been reached or not and the reward that had been obtained. This screen was displayed for 2 s and was followed by a blank screen of 2–5 s (jittered) before the next cue screen occurred. Participants completed as many journeys as possible in four successive runs buttressed by lead-in and lead-out durations of 10 s and 5 s, respectively. The total scanning time, including anatomical and localizer scans, was around 75 min per participant.  Training Task All participants were trained in a separate behavioral session that took place outside the scanner exactly 2 days before the main experimental task. This training session was similar to the main task, with the following exceptions. First, the map (e.g., Figure 1B) was shown for 10 s prior to the start of each journey. Second, participants were allowed unlimited time to respond, moving on to the next screen only after a key press had been initiated. Third, the available actions were shown in the color of the corresponding line, and a picture matching the name of each station was displayed consistently in the background to facilitate the learning of the map. An additional key press (space bar) was required to switch between lines and, during a line switch, an animated clock was shown on screen and a delay of 1 s was imposed. On each journey, the starting and destination stations were selected uniformly, permitting a larger number of possible journeys and, at the end of each journey, a feedback screen informed the participant of (1) the total length of the journey and (2) the minimum length that could have been be achieved (i.e whether their journey had been optimal or not). During training, journeys were never cancelled and no monetary outcomes were associated with successful journeys. Lastly, we introduced ten ‘‘quizzes’’ at homogeneous times during the training session (always between journeys), each including ten ‘‘questions’’ where the current station and the goal were cued, but participants were only required to respond to the ﬁrst step toward the goal. Participants were informed of the scores obtained at the end of each quiz and were instructed to learn during the whole session as to maximize their scores during the quiz. They completed as many journeys as possible over a period of 45 min.  On the day of scanning, before entering the MRI, participants performed a practice block identical to one of the main task scanner runs. They were allowed to see the map one last time before the beginning of this second training session. Data from this session were not included in the analyses.  fMRI Acquisition Magnetic resonance images were acquired with a 3T Siemens VERIO scanner with a 32-channel head coil using a standard echo-planar imaging sequence. Whole-head T2*-weighted echo-planar images were continuously acquired with a repetition time of 2 s, echo time of 30 ms. We acquired fMRI data in four runs (17 min each) of between 456 and 510 volumes, plus three dummy scans discarded before the analyses. For technical reasons, three participants completed only three runs. Each volume included 64 3 64 3 36 voxels of 3 3 3 3 3 mm. A high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was also obtained (voxel size = 1 3 1 3 1 mm). For standard preprocessing and univariate statistical analyses, we used SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, United Kingdom). All other analyses were carried out with custom scripts for Matlab (Mathworks). We also used XjView (http://www.alivelearn. net/xjview) to visualize the data and to construct mask images and impose an FDR correction for multiple comparisons (Genovese et al., 2002). For each  participant, we ﬁrst realigned all functional images, then we co-registered (rigid body transformation) the anatomical scan to the mean functional image. We then segmented each subject’s co-registered anatomical scan, using segmented probabilistic maps for gray matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal ﬂuid, bone, soft tissue, and air/background in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The parameters obtained were applied to normalize the subject’s functional scans to the template brain MNI space. Functional images were resampled (3 3 3 3 3 mm voxels) and spatially smoothed (6-mm full-width half-maximum [FWHM] Gaussian kernel). For all analyses, a 128 s temporal high-pass ﬁlter was applied to remove low-frequency scanner artifacts. Temporal autocorrelation in the time series data was estimated using restricted maximum-likelihood estimates of variance components using a ﬁrst-order autoregressive model (AR-1), and the resulting non-sphericity was used to form maximum-likelihood estimates of the activations, consistent with standard approaches in SPM (Penny et al., 2006).  Behavioral Analyses We analyzed log reaction times with linear regression as described in the main text and the signiﬁcant contribution of each regressor was validated through a t test using an alpha of p < 0.05. All regressors and interactions were Z scored before being introduced in the regression. The optimal path was obtained through a generalized version of the Dijkstra algorithm that minimized multiple distances, by priority: in number of stations, number of response switches, and number of exchange stations. The U-turn cost was deﬁned as the signed difference between the distance in number of stations and the Manhattan (cityblock) distance: DU(a,b) = DS(a,b)   jxa   xbj   jya   ybj, where (xi,yi) are the geometrical coordinates of a station i, j$j is the absolute value operator, and DS is the distance in number of stations. An illustration of how the various indices of distance to goal were computed is shown in Figure 1D. The original Dijkstra algorithm was based on in-house code.  Univariate Analyses of Functional Data All univariate analyses were based on a generalized linear model (GLM) approach. Our GLM included regressors coding for onsets and durations of stimuli or events, which were then convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF) and regressed against the observed fMRI data. Scanner runs were concatenated for univariate analyses, and constant terms for each run were included manually. Additionally, motion parameters and the average signal outside of the brain were included as nuisance variables for all GLMs. Group-level statistics were estimated from the individual b patterns, not the within-subject statistics.  The main analyses described in the paper were based on two GLMs. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we only considered journeys where the participant always moved toward the goal (‘‘optimal’’ journeys), but other journeys were modeled separately. GLM1 included the following conditions convolved with the canonical HRF basis function: main effect of cue screen; main effect of feedback screen; and main effect of navigation screen for suboptimal journeys. We modeled navigation screens during optimal journeys independently for (1) line changes, (2) exchange stations without a line change, (3) elbow stations, and (4) regular stations without response switch. Additionally, we included the following parametric modulators for regular stations without response switch: distance to goal in number of stations (DS); distance to goal in number of line changes (DL); distance to goal in number of exchange stations (DX); and the U-turn cost (DU). GLM2 included the following conditions: main effect of cue screen; main effect of feedback screen; and main effect of navigation screen. Additionally, the navigation screen included the following parametric modulators: type of station (exchange > regular); type of response (switch > stay); interaction between station and response; distance to goal in number of stations (DS); and performance on the current step (1 if optimal and  1 otherwise).  All effects reported survived FDR correction for multiple comparisons, unless noted in the main text. Images and tables are thresholded at p < 0.001, unless otherwise noted. All the analyses described here focused on effects during the time of navigation. Peak activations are reported with the coordinate system of the MNI template brain. Regions of interest (ROI) were deﬁned by manually selecting clusters under a threshold of p < 0.001 uncorrected.  The mask in rlPFC was extracted from a main effect of distance to goal in  GLM2.  Neuron 90, 893–903, May 18, 2016 901  BOLD-RT Correlation Analysis We extracted the average beta obtained from GLM1, and we obtained average values for dmPFC and PMC. We also obtained similar beta values of effect of DS and DL in explaining log-reaction times (see Experimental Procedures, Behavioral Analyses). We then performed a non-parametric Spearman correlation across participants for each region and type of distance.  Single-Trial GLM Approach We performed a single-trial analysis in order to extract the average signal in PMC before and after a line change, an elbow station, an exchange station without response switch (i.e., a line stay), or a regular station without response switch. First, we constructed a design matrix in which each trial was modeled with a unique regressor. From this, we obtained a single scalar BOLD estimate for each voxel on each trial. We then averaged these values within the PMC region for each station type. To avoid double dipping, our ROI was deﬁned based on orthogonal contrast of type of station (exchange > regular) from GLM2 (p < 0.001 uncorrected). Second, we averaged the PMC signal for the neighboring trials around each condition (i.e., line change, elbow station, line stay, and regular station) within the journey. Critically, we restricted these neighboring trials only to regular stations without response switch.  Our prediction was that the BOLD signal in PMC would be higher before a line change than after, but that this difference would not be reﬂected around elbow stations or exchange stations without a line change. We calculated the difference on the trials immediately before/after each condition and performed a statistical analysis on the main effects of type of station and type of response on this difference. For better visualization, we controlled for between-subject variability in Figure 3A, where we displayed the activity in PMC of all other conditions relative to the average signal in regular stations without response switch.  Representation Similarity Analysis For representation similarity analysis (RSA), we constructed a new GLM with four regressors (per scanner run) that each encoded regular stations (without a response switch) corresponding to one subway line (context regressors), and four further parametric regressors that modulated each event by distance to goal (in number of stations; context distance regressors). We used unsmoothed images for this analysis. Additional regressors encoded other quantities (cue screen; feedback screen; in navigation: line changes, ‘‘elbow’’ stations, and exchange stations without a line change; and nuisance regressors). We used a searchlight approach, in which a sphere of 15 mm radius was moved progressively over the brain volume, with the resulting RSA estimates allocated to the centroid voxel for localization and display. Results obtained with a smaller radius (10 mm) were qualitatively very similar. For context decoding (Figure 4B), we estimated for each scanner run (n = 4) the pattern of resulting betas for each of the four context regressors and computed their correlation distance (1-Pearson correlation) yielding a 16 3 16 neural dissimilarity matrix. This matrix was regressed against the predicted representation dissimilarity matrix (RDM) shown in Figure 4A within each searchlight and statistics performed on the resulting betas at the second (between-subject) level. In the predicted RDM, distances were greater between lines than within lines. We excluded comparisons within a single run, to control temporal autocorrelation in the within-session BOLD signal. An identical approach was used for the context distance regressors (Figure 4C). In the control condition (Figure 4D), the assignment of regular and elbow stations to each line was shufﬂed, so that the hierarchical structure was lost. We then repeated the estimation of beta patterns and the searchlight RSA approach as above.

The present research addresses this question by combining recent neuroscientiﬁc insights with ecologically meaningful behavioral methods. Participants formed impressions of real people whom they met in a personally involving situation. fMRI and supporting behavioral data revealed that outcome dependency (i.e., depending on another person for a desired outcome) alters previously identiﬁed neural dynamics of impression formation. Consistent with past research, a functional localizer identiﬁed a region of dorsomedial PFC previously linked to social impression formation. In the main task, this ROI revealed the predicted patterns of activity across outcome dependency conditions: greater BOLD response when information conﬁrmed (vs. violated) social expectations if participants were outcome-independent, and the reverse pattern if participants were outcome-dependent. We suggest that, although social perceivers often discount expectancy-disconﬁrming information as noise, being dependent on another person for a desired outcome focuses impression-formation processing on the most diagnostic information, rather than on the most tractable information.  © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  Consistent impressions of inconsistent people  The ability to distill the vast amount of interpersonal information that people encounter each day into compact impressions is critical for making sense of the social world. As such, a central goal of cognitive neuroscientists studying social processes has been not only to deﬁne the mental operations and neural processes that give rise to social impressions, but also to characterize the nature of these impressions themselves. One consistent observation from behavioral research has been that not all social information counts equally—rather, certain pieces of information come to compose central expectations about people, and these expectations exert a strong pull over how subsequent information is interpreted. Historically, social psychologists have expressed this observation in terms of trait centrality (Asch, 1946), trait primacy (Asch, 1946), implicit personality theory (Rosenberg and Sedlak, 1972), social schemata (Delia and Crockett, 1973), prototypes (Cantor and Mischel, 1979), and various theories of stereotyping (Hamilton and Sherman, 1996).  In parallel, cognitive neuroscience has long viewed this drive toward coherent representations as a general property of cognition and perception (e.g., Sporns et al., 2004; Tononi et al., 1998). Likewise, the importance of perceivers' expectations in guiding these integrative processes  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Psychology, Princeton University, Princeton,  NJ, USA.

These various perspectives all predict (correctly) that people will tend to form coherent, stable impressions of other people, objects, and scenes. This is adaptive, because representing the world as coherent and stable makes the world more comprehensible and easier to act on. However, the brain's proclivity to extract structure and patterns from noisy inputs leads to more-than-occasional cognitive missteps. People see coherent objects where none exist, conﬁdently invest money to capitalize on illusory stock market patterns, and construct memories that comport well with expected event structures, but poorly with actual events (e.g., Bartlett, 1932; Whitson and Galinsky, 2008).  Given the brain's general (over)zealousness for building coherence, it is unsurprising that (at least according to the dominant models in social psychology) people typically construe other agents as consistent entities whose actions are guided primarily by stable dispositions (Gilbert and Malone, 1995; Jones and Harris, 1967; c.f. Malle, 2006). This personality-driven construal (notably, a primarily Western phenomenon, Choi et al., 1999) is, in many ways, unrealistic. People are, in fact, remarkably variable in their behavior across time and situations (Ross and Nisbett, 1991). Yet “knowing” that people are variable does not necessarily diminish the drive toward stable social impressions—just as “knowing” that the stairs in M.C. Escher's  600  D.L. Ames, S.T. Fiske / NeuroImage 83 (2013) 599–608  Ascending and Descending (1960) are logically irreconcilable does not diminish the drive to construct a visually coherent staircase. An important question then, is how people maintain consistent impressions of other people when other people are so inconsistent.  The tools of cognitive neuroscience can be usefully applied to this question, having already delineated the biological underpinnings of several “coherence problems” (see Achieving consistency by discounting the inconsistent and Achieving consistency by integrating the inconsistent sections), as well as many of the structures that contribute to social impression formation. By far the most consistent area to emerge in studies of impression formation is a dorsal region of medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC; for meta-analyses and reviews, see Denny et al., 2012; Mitchell, 2009; van Overwalle, 2009; Wagner et al., 2012). Several other regions, including the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), amygdala, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and superior temporal sulcus (STS), have also been implicated in impression formation processes (Cloutier et al., 2011; Freeman et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2011; Mende-Siedlecki et al., in press; Mitchell et al., 2005; Schiller et al., 2009). Yet this research reveals very little about what speciﬁc processing strategies might be deployed to resolve what is arguably the fundamental problem of impression formation (Hamilton and Sherman, 1996): creating highly coherent representations from highly divergent information. Moreover, neuroimaging studies that attempt to examine impression formation under relatively naturalistic conditions are all but absent from the literature. This is perhaps puzzling, since the functional value of impression formation (at least as described by some cognitive neuroscientists) lies largely in being able to understand and predict other people. By understanding others and predicting their behavior, one can improve one's social interactions, and better achieve desired outcomes—both social and material. Yet these studies rely on forming impressions of “people” (usually face databases and/or invented names) with whom participants will never interact, who cannot help perceivers to desired outcomes, and who may not even be regarded as “real.” Thus, the question of how dMPFC (or other regions) might respond under more involving conditions remains unanswered.  Achieving consistency by discounting the inconsistent  A review of relevant research points toward two (conﬂicting) approaches that people might use to create and sustain coherent social impressions. The ﬁrst is to discount or explain away information that does not conform to preconceived expectations. Well-established theories from neuroscience (Kersten et al., 2004), cognitive psychology (Anderson, 1998) and social psychology (Fiske and Linville, 1980; Snyder and Swann, 1978) converge on the notion that selectively discounting expectancy-disconﬁrming information is an efﬁcient learning strategy, relieving people of the burden of interpreting information that is difﬁcult to process and that, given what is already “known” seems more likely to represent noise than signal (consistent with a Bayesian learning approach; Anderson, 1998).  Achieving consistency by integrating the inconsistent  However, not all expectancies are accurate; therefore, not all expectancy-disconﬁrming information is noise. Inaccurate impressions arise partially from the fact that people often form these impressions based on minimal evidence. For example, people can provide a judgment of others' trustworthiness after seeing their face for as little as 33 ms (Todorov et al., 2009). The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior insula have been frequently implicated in these rapid, intuitive impressions. These judgments, though not necessarily accurate, nonetheless predict important outcomes, including political elections and criminal sentences (for an overview, see Ames et al., 2011). This and other research (e.g., Ambady and Rosenthal, 1993; Devine, 1989) highlights the fact that social expectancies, while strongly felt and  demonstrably inﬂuential, are often based on scant evidence. Thus, under-informed expectances routinely become the lenses through which other people are viewed. In principle, information that violates these expectancies provides a means of correcting the prescription of these lenses, delivering valuable cues as to when impressions may be erroneous, while simultaneously provisioning the perceiver with the raw materials for building a more nuanced understanding. Revising impressions takes effort, however, and often the core goal of maintaining cognitive consistency trumps the objective of perceiving the world accurately (Hamilton and Sherman, 1996), people being cognitive misers (Fiske and Taylor, 2013).  Still, people do sometimes attend more to unexpected information than to expected information, with inferior frontal and temporoparietal cortices often playing a key role in reorienting visual attention toward expectancy violations (e.g. Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Mitchell, 2008; Schank and Abelson, 1977), and posterior STS frequently observed in conjunction with unexpected changes in social gaze or movement (Frith and Frith, 2010; Pelphrey et al., 2003; Saxe et al., 2004). Moreover, these violations, when attended to, can inform social impressions (Srull and Wyer, 1989). Some of these ﬁndings appear to conﬂict with the literature reviewed in the previous section, suggesting that people may sometimes employ a second impression formation strategy, one that maintains coherent impressions, not by explaining away incongruous information, but by adjusting the impression to accommodate that information.  Which one when?  In sum, there are at least two competing approaches by which people might maintain consistent impressions of other people— explaining away inconsistency to preserve the impression, and altering the impression to ﬁt the inconsistency. Given that previous literature provides examples of both approaches to maintaining coherent impressions (both social and nonsocial), it seems likely that the appropriate question is not which approach people use, but rather which one when.  Neural predictions and rationale  The present study investigates one answer to this question (recognizing that there may be more than one). It begins with the following premise: people pay attention to information that helps them get what they want. This suggests that when people depend on someone else for a desired outcome (when they are outcomedependent on that person), perceivers may attend to information about the other person that they would ordinarily ignore (including, perhaps, expectancy-disconﬁrming information). This idea is supported by behavioral research showing that people selectively allocate limited cognitive resources toward people who are most apt to have functional implications (Ackerman et al., 2006; Rodin, 1987; Sporer, 2001). Also consistent with this hypothesis, several behavioral studies from the social attention literature reveal that being outcome-dependent focuses interpersonal attention (as measured in looking time) on inconsistencies (Erber and Fiske, 1984; Neuberg and Fiske, 1987; Ruscher and Fiske, 1990).  But while the thesis that outcome dependency increases attention to otherwise-ignored information is well supported, the hypothesis that outcome dependency alters impression formation processes has (perhaps surprisingly) received little support from this literature (see Discussion section). However, this may be largely explained by methodological limitations. Prior investigations into the effect of outcome dependency on impression formation have lacked a dependent variable that measures, in real time, the extent to which any given piece of information engages the cognitive processes subserving impression-formation. Cognitive neuroscience provides such a measure, as well as a large corpus of data indicating what areas of the brain most reliably index these processes. As noted in Consistent  D.L. Ames, S.T.

While the responsiveness of this region to social impressions has been long established, new studies have continued to articulate further the region's critical role in processing others' traits and personalities. For example, a recent experiment employing multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) required participants to learn the personalities of four individuals. A whole-brain searchlight procedure revealed that the speciﬁc identity of the person being thought about could be reliably decoded from dmPFC, but not from any other region (Hassabis et al., in press).  More generally, dmPFC is well-suited to perform the various cognitive functions required by impression formation, having been implicated in the online integration of information across time (Hasson et al., 2007), understanding the motivations behind other agents' actions (Spunt et al., 2011), encoding memories related to people (Mitchell et al., 2004), and goal-directed retrieval of semantic information (Binder et al., 2009). Though it makes good theoretical sense that the computations subserving these diverse processes would factor into impression formation, the fact that dmPFC is a large area of cortex with a large set of functions presents interpretational challenges. For this reason, the present study employs a well-established impression-formation task as a localizer to identify voxels speciﬁcally sensitive to impression-formation. Convergent and divergent evidence for this region's functional proﬁle is then sought through independent behavioral measures; analysis of the main task is then restricted to these a priori-deﬁned voxels.  This approach provides an opportunity to test the hypothesis that depending on another person for a desired outcome leads to changes in the neural dynamics of impression formation—with expectancyconﬁrming or -disconﬁrming information differentially driving dmPFC depending on whether the perceiver's ability to achieve desired outcomes depends on the target. Speciﬁcally, we predict that voxels in dmPFC that subserve impression formation should be more recruited in processing expectancy-conﬁrming over -disconﬁrming information under outcome-independent conditions, but should show the reverse pattern under outcome-dependent conditions. This is the ﬁrst study to examine the role of asymmetrical outcome dependency in neural systems of impression formation.  Ecological validity  Several methodological features of the present experiment differentiate it from previous studies. The most important of these concerns ecological validity. First, participants formed impressions of real people whom they had met in person several minutes prior to scanning. Second, participants expected to work cooperatively with these individuals immediately following scanning. Third, a desired reward was contingent on this work; thus, the paradigm presented participants with a genuine motivation to form impressions (rather than simply instructions to do so), as their understanding of their partners would likely affect their ability to work with them and to obtain the desired outcome. Fourth, the information that participants saw during the impression formation task was functionally relevant to the participants themselves, since it pertained to the interaction they expected to have a few minutes later. Finally, participants performed no explicit task during scanning, allowing us to study impression formation under somewhat more naturalistic conditions.  Methods  Behavioral procedure  Cover story  Participants (N = 19, 6 male; M = 19.1 years, SD = 1.2) were told that the purpose of the study was to investigate “how experts  and non-experts work together to solve problems creatively.” Prior to scanning, the experimenter introduced the participant to two confederates, explaining that the confederates were studying education at a neighboring university. It was further explained that they had been hired as “expert consultants” because the present study involved educational themes. To support the ostensible university afﬁliation of the confederates, they made subtle use of authentic props that had been purchased from the neighboring university's bookstore (e.g. a lanyard featuring that university's name pulled incidentally from a confederate's pocket). The task (adapted from Erber and Fiske, 1984), which would supposedly be completed after the fMRI scan, would require using a set of engaging wind-up toys (which participants saw on the experimenter's desk) to invent educational games for ﬁrst-graders—for example, the concept of addition might be explored by having two of the toys hop toward a larger set. The experimenter noted that the participant and confederates would ﬁrst generate ideas on their own, and then each expert–novice pair would work together to produce a joint product from their individual ideas (i.e., the participant would work with each confederate in turn).  Outcome dependency manipulation  To manipulate participants' outcome dependency, the experimenter explained that a $50.00 prize would be awarded to the non-expert participant who performed best in the task involving the toys (confederates, being experts, would be paid a ﬂat consulting fee). This was justiﬁed by explaining that one of the study's objectives was to explore the role of incentive structures in expert/non-expert collaboration. In order to allow the study to compare two different incentive structures, the participant would work with each of the two “experts” under slightly different reward conditions. When the participant worked with Confederate I (outcome-independent condition), the participant's own eligibility for the $50.00 prize would depend only on what the participant did in the ﬁrst phase of the task (generating ideas individually). In contrast, when the participant worked with Confederate D (outcome-dependent condition), the participant's own eligibility for the prize would depend on what the participant and confederate did together during the second phase of the task. Thus, participants were outcome-dependent on one confederate (because participants depended on this confederate for a desired outcome—gaining $50.00), but outcome-independent with respect to the other confederate (because the second confederate's contributions would not be weighed in determining prize eligibility).  Four points should be noted with respect to the outcome dependency manipulation. First, participants expected to do exactly the same activities with both confederates (ﬁrst generating ideas and then working on those ideas collaboratively); the only difference would be the criteria for prize eligibility (that is, outcome dependency). Second, in neither condition was the collaboration competitive between partners because the confederates were not eligible for the prize—again, only the basis of prize eligibility for the participant differed across conditions. Third, because the confederates were not eligible for the prize, the participants' outcome dependency status (the variable of interest) was not confounded with factors of non-interest, such as the desire to help the expert partner maximize their outcomes. Finally, confederate identity and outcome dependency condition were counterbalanced across participants (i.e., the actors playing the roles of the education experts traded off which part they played).  Establishing expectancies  Following the outcome dependency manipulation, participants and confederates completed a Participant Information Form. Reading the confederates' forms allowed participants to naturalistically generate expectations about each of them (so that expectancy-conﬁrming and -disconﬁrming information could be shown during subsequent scanning). The form included several demographic items, and a blank space in which participants and confederates were to predict  602  D.L. Ames, S.T. Fiske / NeuroImage 83 (2013) 599–608  how well they would do on the toy task, and also to discuss their background (if applicable) in this sort of work. Confederates wrote prepared statements in this space—one describing herself as “lov[ing] teaching K and ﬁrst-grade” and as being “a camp instructor for 6–8-year-olds,” and the other describing herself as “prefer[ring] to work with middleschoolers” and “now specializing [with that age group]” (see supplemental materials for complete self-descriptions). For convenience, we refer to these as expectancies as the “grade-school expectancy” and the “middle-school expectancy,” respectively. The expectancies themselves were of no scientiﬁc interest (fully counterbalanced); expectancies were simply necessary so that the effects of expectancyconﬁrming and -disconﬁrming information could be examined. Analyses revealed no difference in liking for the two expectancy-paired confederates (assessed by having participants make a hashmark on a line indicating how much they liked each confederate; grade-school expectancy, M = 9.4, SD = 1.5; middle-school expectancy, M = 8.1, SD = 2.5; ns).  Confederates then left (“to work on their teaching questionnaires”) while the participant prepared for the fMRI portion of the experiment. Prior to scanning, participants reviewed each confederate's personal statement paired with her snapshot, a manipulation that had reliably produced the predicted interpersonal expectations in pretesting.  Attention measure: glancing behavior  After the outcome-expectancy manipulation and before dismissing the confederates, an assistant surreptitiously recorded (using paper and pen) how often the participant looked at each of the two confederates, who were seated on either side of the participant (fully counterbalanced with all other variables; see supplementary materials for additional procedural details). Post-experimental interviews conﬁrmed that both participants and confederates were unaware of this procedure during data collection.  Main task  Immediately prior to fMRI scanning, participants were given the  following instructions:  One of the things that might inﬂuence how people work with expert partners is what they know about those partners and the background from which they derive their expertise. To that end, we're going to show you some “teaching notes.” We're interested in comparing your brain responses as you're learning about these people to what you do when you work with these people.  During fMRI scanning, participants viewed sentences about the two confederates without any explicit task. Participants believed that these sentences were excerpts of the confederates' “teaching evaluation notes” from the past semester (participants watched the confederates hand these notes on ﬂash drives to the experimenter, and watched the experimenter upload them to the computer that presented the scanning task). Ostensibly, these notes had been taken by other student teachers while the confederates worked with classrooms of ﬁrst graders. In truth, these statements had been invented for the study. Half of these (n = 60) had been pretested as conﬁrming the grade-school expectancy (e.g., “[She] read in different voices for the different characters;” “If anything, she spent too much time on making [the lesson] fun”). These same 60 items were also pretested on separate subjects as disconﬁrming the middle-school expectancy. The other half of the stimuli (n = 60) were pretested as conﬁrming the middle-school expectancy, and (again, separately) as also disconﬁrming the grade-school expectancy (for example, by referencing teaching methods well-suited to middle-school students, but poorly suited for grade-school students; “Her turtle example was interesting, but probably too complicated;” “She maybe forgot that  not all of the kids knew how to tell time”). Conditions were matched for statement length (number of words).  During scanning, participants viewed each of the 120 statements once (approx. 3450 ms per statement, jittered). The intertrial interval separating statements was variable from 1250 ms to 9250 ms in steps of 2000 ms to obtain temporal jitter required to deconvolve event-related fMRI response. For each participant, a random half of these statements were paired with the grade-school expectancy confederate, and the other half were paired with the middle-school expectancy confederate. The snapshot that appeared with a given statement indicated to whom that statement pertained. Thus, half (n = 30) of the statements that were paired with each confederate conﬁrmed the participant's expectancy about that confederate, and the other half (n = 30) disconﬁrmed that expectancy. Across participants, each of the 120 stimuli was equally likely to be assigned to any of the four cells in the 2 (dependent/independent) × 2 (consistent/inconsistent) design (i.e., all stimuli served as their own controls); and, only outcome dependency and expectancy-conﬁrmation/disconﬁrmation (the two variables of interest) varied across conditions.  Functional localizer  Following the main task, participants completed a second, wellvalidated experiment used to identify regions of the brain preferentially recruited for forming social impressions. In line with prior neuroimaging (Mitchell et al., 2004, 2005) and behavioral studies (e.g., Hamilton et al., 1980; Klein and Loftus, 1990), participants saw a photograph of an unknown person and a piece of information pertaining to that person on each trial. On “form impression” trials (n = 20), participants were asked to form an impression of the person pictured. On “remember order” trials (n = 20), participants were asked to remember the order in which the information appeared. Following previous experiments, participants believed that they would be tested on both conditions after scanning. Although both conditions require participants to relate each piece of information to a speciﬁc individual, only the form-impression condition requires impression formation. Recent data from other researchers (Ma et al., 2011, 2012) show that these deliberate “form impression” instructions produce the same patterns of activation in dmPFC as spontaneous impression formation. That is, regardless of whether participants deliberately use information to form impressions or encounter impressionrelevant information with no explicit task demands, dmPFC apparently contributes the same functions (while major differences emerge in other areas, including a more posterior region of medial frontal cortex [pMFC] and right prefrontal cortex [rPFC]).  As with the main task, assignment of stimuli to condition was randomized across participants such that each stimulus served as its own control. This secondary experiment provided an independently deﬁned impression-formation region of interest (ROI) identiﬁed from completely separate scans. Limiting analyses of the main task to this region reduces the need for subjective judgments of functional localization, providing a more principled test of the main hypothesis. Previous experiments employing this task have consistently identiﬁed a region of dmPFC (Mitchell et al., 2004, 2005). The present investigation employed identical procedures and stimuli to those used in these previous studies. This design does not include a baseline condition of faces without information.  fMRI data acquisition  BOLD signal was used to assess regional brain activation. EPI were acquired with a Siemens 3.0-T Allegra scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard head coil (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, matrix size = 64 × 64). Whole brain coverage was achieved with 34 interleaved 3.6-mm axial slices with an interslice gap of 0.36 mm. At the end of each scan session, a high-resolution  D.L. Ames, S.T. Fiske / NeuroImage 83 (2013) 599–608  603  anatomical image was acquired (T1-MPRAGE, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 8°, matrix size = 256 × 256) (Fig. 1).  Preprocessing  fMRI data were preprocessed using BrainVoyager software (Brain Innovation, version 1.8). Preprocessing included slice time correction, linear trend removal and high-pass ﬁltering (frequencies below 3 cycles per functional run removed). To correct for head motion, we used a 3D algorithm that adjusts for small head movements via rigid body transformations of all slices to the ﬁrst reference volume. All functional images were transformed to standard Talairach space so that corresponding brain regions were roughly spatially aligned. To further overcome misregistration across subjects, the data were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian ﬁlter of 6-mm full width at half-maximum value. To remove transient nonspeciﬁc signal elevation effects at the beginning of the experiment, we excluded the ﬁrst 5 timepoints of each functional run.  In order to correct for false positives, activations were clustercorrected using standard software: AFNI's alphasim. Speciﬁcally, we applied a Monte Carlo simulation that takes into account the matrix size and smoothness of the speciﬁc dataset under consideration in order to determine the appropriate cluster size threshold (Forman et al., 1995). For the present dataset, a minimum cluster size of 22 voxels combined with a voxelwise threshold of p b .005 was found to be required to control for false positives at a corrected alpha of p b .05. Importantly, the estimate of the spatial correlation across voxels was modeled using the program 3dFWHMx, not the amount of Gaussian smoothing applied during preprocessing (see Bennett et al., 2009).  Individual difference measures  Following scanning, participants completed the personal need for structure scale (PNS; Neuberg and Newsom, 1993), a measure of individuals' preference for structure and internal consistency. A straightforward interpretation of this scale predicts that people exhibiting greater tolerance for inconsistency should be more likely to use (rather than ignore or explain away) expectancy-inconsistent information. We therefore capitalized on the existence of this scale to provide an independent means of validating our region of interest. Speciﬁcally, we predicted that PNS scores would correlate positively with BOLD response to expectancy-conﬁrming vs. -disconﬁrming information (that is, greater difference scores of average betas). In order to show discriminant validity, participants also completed the implicit person  theory scale (IPT Levy et al., 1998). This frequently-used scale shares some psychometric characteristics with the PNS, including a six-point response range (1–6) and identically-worded anchors (“strongly disagree”–“strongly agree”). Critically, if both scales index acceptance of discrepant information—however the PNS focuses on the belief that people can change over time, a theme not especially related to the present study, since all “teaching evaluation notes” were ostensibly from the same semester. We predicted that the PNS, but not the IPT would correlate with activity in the ROI. Two participants did not complete these questionnaires because their scanning sessions ran over time.  Functional characterization of region of interest  Thus, prior to testing our main hypotheses, we establish three separate lines of evidence to suggest that the region of cortex we investigated in this study supports the processes of interest (though it certainly supports other processes as well). First, dozens (if not hundreds) of imaging studies have now implicated dmPFC in impression formation (Denny et al., 2012; Mitchell, 2009; van Overwalle, 2009; Wagner et al., 2012). Second, we identiﬁed an ROI a priori using a functional localizer. This task has been validated in both behavioral and neuroimaging research and consistently identiﬁes a region of dmPFC. Moreover, the region identiﬁed by this task correlates with successful encoding (i.e., memory) for person information when participants are forming an impression of the target (but not when performing a sequencing task; Mitchell et al., 2004). Third, we added an additional layer of independence by validating the function of this region (in addition to its location) by testing whether that function correlated with an individual differences measure of personal need for structure (but not with a superﬁcially similar scale)  Results  fMRI results  Functional localizer  We began our analysis by identifying regions of cortex subserving impression formation in the functional localizer task using a standard random effects GLM contrast (form impression N sequencing). Consistent with previous studies, the functional localizer identiﬁed a region of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ([−12, 25, 54], 22 voxels, 3 × 3 × 3 mm, p b .05 cluster-corrected) as preferentially responsive to the form impression condition vs. the sequencing condition. A more ventral region of mPFC and right anterior lobe also emerged from  Fig. 1. Average BOLD response of dmPFC as a function of perceivers' dependence on target person and expectancy-consistency of information about that person. Consistent with previous research, a region of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex emerged from the contrast form impression N remember order in the functional localizer (A). This a-priori selected region revealed the predicted interaction in the main task, with greater activation to expectancy-conﬁrming (vs. expectancy-disconﬁrming) information for the outcome-independent target, and the opposite pattern for the outcome-dependent target (B).  604  D.L. Ames, S.T. Fiske / NeuroImage 83 (2013) 599–608  this contrast (see Table 1). As noted in Functional characterization of region of interest section, activity in this same region of dmPFC, deﬁned by the same task and using the same stimuli and instructions, correlates with correct recall of person information during impression formation trials, but not during sequencing trials.  Science is cumulative, and rather than replicate this recall effect, we sought to build upon it, ﬁrst by showing a new behavioral correlate for this now-standard impression formation region (see Personal need for structure scale section), and then by using the functional localizer to test our primary hypotheses concerning outcome dependency and social expectations.  Main analysis  In the main analysis, we again employed a standard random effects GLM approach, modeling the data as a 2 (outcome-dependent, outcome-independent) × 2 (expectancy-conﬁrming, expectancydisconﬁrming) ANOVA. The predicted crossover interaction was observed in the dmPFC ROI, F(1, 18) = 8.40, p b .01, partial η2 = .33. When participants did not depend on the target, this region was more active in processing expectancy-conﬁrming information than expectancy-disconﬁrming information, t(18) = 2.34, p b .05, uncorrected. This suggests that, when outcome-independent, participants selectively marshaled impression information resources to process information that seemed more likely to represent signal than noise, given what they already knew. However absent outcome dependency, participants discounted the unexpected as noise, thereby fulﬁlling the goal of maintaining coherence without engaging in the effortful and complex task of changing the impression (Table 2). The pattern reversed, however, when participants depended upon the target for something desirable (money), with expectancydisconﬁrming information driving the impression formation ROI marginally more than expectancy-conﬁrming information, t(18) = 1.9, p = .07, uncorrected. One likely interpretation of this reversal is that when participants had something at stake (i.e., when they depended on the confederate for their ﬁnancial outcomes), they may have had other goals beyond maintaining coherence—such as forming an accurate impression to help them better predict (and perhaps inﬂuence) the confederate and thereby obtain the desired outcome. They may have therefore taken seriously the unexpected information and used it to update their impressions (Mende-Siedlecki et al., in press), while mobilizing limited impression formation resources relatively less for expectancy-conﬁrming information (which is, by deﬁnition, redundant, and therefore less diagnostic). This interpretation is supported by previous research demonstrating that cognitive and perceptual resources are typically allocated toward individuals with the most signiﬁcant implications for the perceiver (e.g., Ackerman et al., 2006; Rodin, 1987; Sporer, 2001). Post-hoc analysis of the more ventral mPFC region revealed a similar pattern of results; however the interaction was nonsigniﬁcant, p = .12.

Cluster size is shown in functional voxels (3 × 3 × 3 mm).  It is worth reiterating that, across subjects, all four conditions contained exactly the same words and pictures pertaining to exactly the same people presented in exactly the same format. The only differences were those that the participants themselves brought into the scanner in the form of (a) their preconceived expectations about the two targets and (b) their differential dependency on those targets for a desired outcome.  No main effect of dependency was observed (F b 1), suggesting that outcome dependency does not simply lead to more impression formation, but rather to a qualitatively different style of impression formation—one that (we suggest) shifts neural resources from a focus on information that is redundant but easy to assimilate, to information that is more difﬁcult to make sense of, but perhaps also more diagnostic. Likewise, no main effect of consistency was observed (F b 1), supporting our claim that the question of how people maintain coherent impressions should not be treated as a question of which kind of information is privileged, but rather which kind of information best serves the perceiver's goals across different social contexts.  Behavioral results  Glancing behavior  People attend to those on whom they depend (see Integration with existing behavioral research section). Thus, if the outcome dependency manipulation in this study was effective, participants should have attended more to the confederate on whom they were outcome-dependent than to the confederate from whom they were outcome-independent. One ecologically valid means of assessing a person's attentional focus is to observe where the person is looking (Rayner, 1998). As predicted, participants looked more often at the confederate on whom they were outcome-dependent (M = 2.5 glances, SD = 2.3) than at the participant from whom they were outcome-independent (M = 1.6, SD = 2.0), t(16) = 2.4, p b .05, d = .42. The durations of individual glances were not recorded.  Personal need for structure scale  It was predicted that people scoring higher in personal need for structure would show a preferential neural response for information that cohered with the structure of their expectations about the targets. Speciﬁcally, we expected this differentiation between expectancy-conﬁrming/-disconﬁrming information to emerge in our a priori-deﬁned subregion of dmPFC, with higher PNS scores corresponding to greater relative responses to expectancy-conﬁrming vs. -disconﬁrming. This prediction was conﬁrmed, r(17) = .55, p b .05 (independent condition: r = .52, p b .05; dependent condition: r = .23, p = .37, ns). Also as predicted, no such correlation was observed when the same analysis was conducted using the implicit person theory scale. To verify that PNS but not IPT signiﬁcantly predicted dmPFC  D.L. Ames, S.T. Fiske / NeuroImage 83 (2013) 599–608  605  response, the data were reanalyzed using multiple regression, with PNS and IPT entered simultaneously as predictors of dmPFC response. The overall model was signiﬁcant, R2adj = .26, F(2,14) = 3.76, p b .05. As predicted, PNS emerged as a signiﬁcant predictor of dmPFC response, β = .506, SE = .02, t(14) = 2.29, p b .05, while IPT did not, β = .214, SE = .03 t(14) = 0.97, p = .35, ns. PNS, IPT and glancing behavior were not signiﬁcantly correlated with one another (ps N .3).  This suggests that, at least in the present investigation, dmPFC BOLD response during social perception relates predictably to differences in how individuals react to expected and unexpected information (PNS); this result cannot be accounted for by more general lay theories about the ﬁxedness of others' personalities and behaviors (IPT). These ﬁndings add to a large set of evidence that the region of dmPFC deﬁned by the impression-formation localizer indexes greater recruitment of impression formation resources (as reviewed in Achieving consistency by discounting the inconsistent section). More importantly for present purposes, these data corroborate the proposal that the region of dmPFC under investigation is functionally sensitive to the speciﬁc kinds of information (expectancy-conﬁrming vs. -disconﬁrming) that are most useful to individual perceivers. We hasten to add that correlations with relatively few observations are notoriously unreliable, and that this novel effect requires replication. However, while this individual differences analysis is correlational, the main analysis tests this same relationship experimentally.  Discussion  The consistency problem  In an inﬂuential analysis of the (then) 50-year history of research in social impression formation, Hamilton and Sherman (1996) identiﬁed the tendency toward unity and coherence as “the fundamental postulate” of impression formation: “The perceiver assumes unity in the personalities of others, and persons are seen as coherent entities; therefore, one's impression of another person should reﬂect that unity and coherence” (p. 337; italics in original). This view still describes the dominant perspective within social psychology. Nevertheless, a substantial body of research suggests that people are in fact neither uniﬁed nor coherent—that human beings are most aptly characterized as a collection of multiple selves, and that their cognitions and behaviors vary greatly with the situation (Roberts and Donahue, 1994; Ross and Nisbett, 1991). This returns us to the question posed in the introduction: how do people maintain uniﬁed and consistent impressions of other people when other people are often inconsistent?  To help answer this question, this study drew upon methods and perspectives from neuroscience, cognitive psychology and social psychology. All three converge on the notion that one approach for solving the consistency problem is to discount or disengage from information that contradicts what is already “known” (Anderson, 1998; Kersten et al., 2004; Snyder and Swann, 1978), and which may therefore seem more likely to represent noise rather than signal.1 A second approach exists however: instead of viewing inconsistency as “noise,” one may see it as a clue that one's current impression is inaccurate or incomplete. In this case, one may choose to focus  1 This approach suggests an essentially Bayesian method of integration. A growing body of evidence suggests that Bayesian integration aptly characterizes neural processes in many domains such as object perception, motor learning, and sensory integration in spatial encoding (Battaglia et al., 2003; Kersten et al., 2004; Knill and Pouget, 2004; Körding and Wolpert, 2004). We suggest that Bayesian theoretical models currently being employed to understand lower-level aspects of brain function might be proﬁtably extended for understanding social cognition (see also Baker et al., 2006). Of course, the term “Bayesian” encompasses a broad range of theoretical models. I. J. Good (1971) calculated (at least half-jokingly) that there were at least 46,656 different kinds of “Bayesians”. Formal tests of any speciﬁc Bayesian model of social processing in the brain await future investigation.  one's limited processing resources on the expectancy-disconﬁrming information—which provides the raw materials for constructing more complete impressions—while treating expectancy-conﬁrming information as redundant (Schank and Abelson, 1977; Srull and Wyer, 1989). This approach, though potentially more effortful (Fiske and Neuberg, 1990), may be more useful when people depend on another person to reach a desired outcome. Speciﬁcally, a more nuanced understanding of another person that takes into account conﬂicting information might help one predict or inﬂuence that person. This ability to predict and inﬂuence could, in turn improve one's chances of gaining the desired outcome from the person in question.  What information counts when?  Integration with existing neuroimaging research  The results reported in this paper suggest that people in fact use both of these approaches, and that they ﬂexibly (though not necessarily consciously) switch between them as a function of social dependency. Impression formation researchers have long recognized that not all information contributes equally to a person's understanding of others' traits. The question of how this information is weighted and, speciﬁcally, how this weighting is instantiated in the brain, is a topic of considerable scientiﬁc interest (e.g., Cloutier et al., 2011; Harris et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2011, 2012; Mende-Siedlecki et al., in press; Mitchell et al., 2006; Schiller et al., 2009; Van Duynslaeger et al., 2007). The present ﬁndings offer a framework for systematically predicting and organizing this weighting (while recognizing that there may be other useful frameworks as well)—speciﬁcally, as a function of a person's (a) expectations about the target and (b) dependency on the target.  Past investigations of the weight given to different types of social information have focused on two relatively stable factors: (a) the content of the information itself (“he kicked a dog” is more diagnostic than “he kicked a soccer ball”) and (b) individual differences in observers (people may vary in their moral beliefs about harming dogs) (Schiller et al., 2009). Without denying the importance of these factors, the present research emphasizes more dynamic aspects of this weighting process, showing that the diagnostic value of any given piece of social information can change depending on (a) social dependency and (b) social expectations.  At ﬁrst blush, this dynamic shifting of dmPFC activity may appear to conﬂict with the results of Schiller et al. (2009). Though Schiller and colleagues provided further evidence that dmFPC is recruited for processing social information, their investigation did not show modulations of dmPFC as a function of which information seemed to inﬂuence individuals' positive/negative valence judgments of targets. A second study by Mende-Siedlecki et al. (in press) also found no effect of valence in dmPFC. Valence, however, is only one component of social impressions; and it is unclear why one should predict that dmPFC (rather than other regions already known to subserve valuation) should be expected to encode the evaluative component of social impressions. In fact, these are the conclusions reached by Schiller and colleagues, who suggest that “the dmPFC is not essential for the evaluative component of impression formation,” and that this evaluative component rather “recruits brain regions that are not socially specialized but are more generally involved in valuation and emotional processes” (p. 512). Thus, previous research points out that informational relevance to valence-speciﬁc appraisals does not produce functional modulations in dMPFC, while the present work shows that social dependency and social expectations do.  Meanwhile, the role of interpersonal expectations in impression formation has been the focus of three recent fMRI studies employing more traditional paradigms. Cloutier et al. (2011) observed greater dmPFC BOLD response to pictures of politicians who were paired with statements that contradicted their (ostensible) political group's norms (e.g., a picture of an ostensible Democrat paired with “He wants smaller  606  D.L. Ames, S.T. Fiske / NeuroImage 83 (2013) 599–608  government” vs. a picture of an ostensible Republican paired with “He is morally conservative, ” p. 584). Similarly, Mende-Siedlecki et al. (in press) and Ma et al. (2012) observed increased dmPFC BOLD amplitude in response to abrupt reversals in the valence of information paired with faces or names (e.g., showing participants the statement “Tolvan gave her sister a hug” followed by the statement “Tolvan gave her mother a slap;” Ma et al., 2012, p. 939). The present investigation aligns well with these studies in suggesting that the same information can be processed differently in dmPFC as a function of one's social expectations. However, Cloutier and colleagues observed a main effect such that unusual (and presumably unexpected) political beliefs elicited greater dmPFC activation. Likewise Mende-Siedlecki and colleagues and Ma and colleagues observed greater dmPFC response when information about a target switched from positive to negative or vice versa (as compared with when no such valence shift occurred). Each of these ﬁndings would seem to predict that the present experiment should ﬁnd a main effect of expectancy-consistency, rather than the socially modulated reversal that was, in fact, observed.  One possible explanation is that when people view large sets of relatively anonymous faces or names, those faces that “stick out” as representing unusual individuals prompt signiﬁcantly more concerted effort at impression formation (see Cloutier et al. for a useful discussion of this individuation processes and Mende-Siedlecki et al. for a useful discussion of impression updating). This interpretation is consistent with research on social attention (Erber and Fiske, 1984) and person memory (Ackerman et al., 2006) and aligns with the intuition that contradictory people are more interesting.  Of course, other factors can make people interesting as well. Targets in the present study were two live individuals whom the participants had just met in the scanning environment—with whom participants had shaken hands, conversed—and, critically, with whom the participants expected to work immediately after scanning. These two people may have therefore been more relevant and interesting to participants than those represented by face databases or invented names. The processing demands may be quite different in such situations. Speciﬁcally, because of constraints on perceptual and cognitive processing capacity (Todd et al., 2005), people tend to dynamically shift processing strategies, continually re-allocating cognitive resources to process the people and information that is most functionally important (e.g., Ackerman et al., 2006; Rodin, 1987; Sporer, 2001).  Thus, the processing demands of a more personally-involving paradigm provide one a theoretically acceptable explanation as to why the present study yielded a different pattern of results from those described above. However, direct comparisons are complicated by the fact that, in these previous studies, half of targets were expectancy-consistent and the other half were inconsistent; whereas in the present experiment, both targets were consistently inconsistent—that is they sometimes behaved as expected, and other times they did not. Relatedly, the expectations being violated in the previous studies were general categories (liberal/conservative) or valence (good/bad); while the expectations about the two teachers would seem to be more speciﬁc, personal, and relevant to participants, since these expectations were about (a) people with whom participants were about to work, (b) the very thing that they were about to work on, and (c) the perceived likelihood of obtaining a desired outcome.  None of this is to ignore the fact that people do sometimes quickly form impressions of large numbers of people in succession, based on only a picture, a few words, and perhaps a category (e.g., members of a Facebook group, characters on a TV show, researchers on a departmental website). This observation underscores the importance of these previous studies. However, impression formation is sometimes also more personal, directed at a smaller number of people whom one has actually met, and has something to do with anticipating behavior, or developing some sense of the people with whom one might interact. We would suggest that the proportion of experiments that presently map onto these two kinds of situations may not reﬂect  the proportions of actual human experience. In fact, despite the large number of neuroimaging experiments addressing social impression formation, we know of no other experiment on this topic in which participants formed impressions of real people whom they had actually met in person.  Integration with existing behavioral research  The BOLD modulations observed in this study align with previous behavioral research on the topic of outcome dependency. These studies demonstrated that outcome dependency can increase the time people spend looking at unexpected social information and the number of dispositional statements offered when participants are asked to think aloud into a tape recorder (Erber and Fiske, 1984; Neuberg and Fiske, 1987; Ruscher and Fiske, 1990). However, direct attempts to measure impression formation have been largely inconclusive to this point. Several experiments in this line of research attempted to explore this link by examining the effect of outcome dependency on liking for a target individual. These liking effects proved inconsistent across studies however. Moreover, when these results were found, the predicted mediating relationship between social attention and changes in liking did not emerge. This pattern of results is problematic for the prospect of inferring impression formation processes from liking ratings. As we have already noted however, there is more to social impressions than liking or disliking someone; thus “amount of liking” may simply be too coarse a measure for testing some hypotheses concerning impression formation. Likewise, while think-aloud protocols are not limited to assessing valence, such procedures force the participant to repeatedly break away from the task to report on their ongoing cognition (a process likely to interfere with normal processing strategies).  Perhaps the most frequently employed behavioral measure of “more” or “less” impression-formation is recall for information about the target. The typical inference is that if one remembers more about person A than person B, one is engaging in “more impression formation” for person A than for person B. However, evidence that impression-formation actually produces increased recall is, at best, mixed (Dabady et al., 1999; Erber and Fiske, 1984; Hamilton et al., 1980; Klein and Loftus, 1990; Ma et al., 2011; Marmurek, 1990; Mitchell et al., 2004; Sedikides et al., 1991). For example, Dabady et al. (1999) randomly assigned participants either to form an impression of a person using a set of information, or to remember the information about the person. At test, impression formation participants remembered no more information than did memorization participants.  The foregoing reviews previous behavioral approaches to linking outcome dependency to impression formation, and suggests possible methodological limitations to this research. A more general observation is that behavioral investigations concerning this topic typically aim to retroactively infer the extent to which participants were forming impressions—by using a summary statistic such as “number of items remembered” or “average liking for target.” Such measures either require the participant to repeatedly break away from the task (as with think-aloud protocols), or more commonly, are collected ofﬂine—after the hypothesized period of impression formation has concluded. Such methods, though ideally suited for many questions, make it difﬁcult to capture the rapid and dynamic nature of the impression formation process, which can change rapidly as a continuous stream of information is presented. An alternative approach therefore is to measure neural responses in the brain online, as the process of interest (impression formation) is occurring. While the large number of previous studies implicating dmPFC activity in impression formation (see Achieving consistency by discounting the inconsistent section) provides the primary empirical basis for our interpretation of dmPFC activity in the context of this experiment, we also localize this function a-priori in our participants' brains using an independent task and provide a novel brain-behavior correlation to support this functional interpretation within the localized region (see Main analysis section).  D.L. Ames, S.T. Fiske / NeuroImage 83 (2013) 599–608  607  However, this study does nothing to resolve the problems described in this section concerning the dearth of online behavioral measures that index “extent of engagement of impression formation processing.” As such, we can adduce no such measure from this experiment to further support the case for dmPFC's involvement in impression formation, and this is a limitation of the present experiment.  assistance with this project.

Conclusion  Conﬂict of interest  Operating from the premise that thinking is for doing (Fiske, 1992)—this experiment aimed to study how participants thought about other people when they were preparing to do something with those people, and when the doing had meaningful consequences for the participants. For this reason, we examined participants learning about real people whom they met under personally involving circumstances, and with whom they expected to work immediately following scanning.  Further integration of socially ecological paradigms with neuroscience is desirable, and this study serves in part as a response to recent calls for more ecologically valid paradigms in cognitive neuroscience, with an eye toward building more ecologically valid theories (Zaki and Ochsner, 2009). However, the fact that the predicted effects were observed within the region deﬁned by a canonical impression formation task also offers some support for the validity of traditional tasks. Speciﬁcally, given that the dMPFC is by far the region most often implicated in traditional fMRI investigations of impression formation, it is encouraging that activity in this region does indeed comport with theory-driven predictions about impression formation and cognitive resource allocation when the targets are real people.  This work identiﬁes two ways in which the neural resources subserving impression formation are allocated in the face of mixed information, and speciﬁes social circumstances under which each is observed. The study combines various methodological approaches, incorporating a functional localizer, individual difference measures correlated with brain function (PNS), the use of actual human targets, and observation of subtle but ecologically meaningful behavior (stolen glances) to address what is currently a major topic of interest in cognitive neuroscience.  We speculate that the tactic of shifting impression formation resources away from expectancy-disconﬁrming information and toward expectancy-conﬁrming information may be something of a default strategy for maintaining coherence (Fiske and Neuberg, 1990). However the suggestion that outcome dependency can elevate the importance of expectancy-disconﬁrming information may be encouraging for those concerned with contemporary issues in social welfare. An inﬂexible policy of discounting inconsistent information can thwart professional advancement (“black people are lazy”), personal relationships (“those kinds of men can't commit”), and diplomatic efforts (“dictatorships are immune to reason”), while simultaneously causing perceivers to write off the very information that would undermine their preconceptions (a sterling résumé, a loving gesture, a request for peace talks). If depending on another person for something increases some kinds of processing for expectancy-disconﬁrming information, it may be possible to combat potentially blinding social expectancies (e.g., stereotypes) by making people (either apparently or actually) dependent on one-another for their outcomes. Though not all social situations can (or should) be restructured to create networks of interdependence, it may be possible to make interdependence more salient where it already exists. After all, people depend on others, either directly or indirectly, for nearly all of their desired outcomes, both social and material.

However, in everyday life many decisions are not followed by feedback, in which case humans have been shown to code the most probable outcome into memory. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural basis of internally generated signals on correctness and decision conﬁdence in the complete absence of feedback in a categorization task. During test trials after observational training activation in dopaminergic target regions was modulated by the correctness of the answer similarly as during feedback-based training. Moreover, activation in the nucleus accumbens and putamen was correlated with the prediction error on conﬁdence as estimated by a reinforcement learning model. In this model subjective conﬁdence ratings acquired after each trial served as outcome measure. Activation in the striatum therefore follows a similar pattern in response to prediction errors on conﬁdence as it does during reinforcement learning in response to reward prediction errors, but with respect to internally generated signals based on knowledge of the structure of the environment. Furthermore, ventral striatal activation decreased with stimulus novelty, which might support the allocation of attention to unfamiliar stimuli. These results provide a parsimonious account for the neural bases of learning, indicating overlapping neural substrates of reinforcement learning and learning when outcome information has to be internally constructed.  © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  Choices are often guided by past experience about which behavior in a given situation provided the most favorable outcome. In the last decade, impressive advances in examining the neural bases of reinforcement learning have been made. Computational theories suggest that during reinforcement learning associative links between stimuli and outcomes are formed and adjusted after each trial to minimize future errors in prediction of the outcome (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Sutton, 1988). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), variables from these models have been shown to be reﬂected in the activation of dopaminergic midbrain neurons and their projection sites also in the human brain. Especially the striatum is activated by a wide range of reinforcing stimuli including juice, odors, money and beauty (see e.g. Abler et al., 2006; Aharon et al., 2001; Gottfried et al., 2002; McClure et al., 2003), but it also responds to information about the correctness of an answer (Aron et al., 2004; Daniel and Pollmann, 2010; Rodriguez et al., 2006). Dopaminergic neurons which project, among other regions, to the striatum, however do not to respond to reward per se. Their activation pattern does not  ⁎ Corresponding author.

Rather, they show phasically increased activation when an unexpected reward occurs (a positive prediction error), and a phasic decrease in activation when an expected reward is omitted (a negative prediction error) (Schultz, 2007). This prediction error signal, the discrepancy between prediction and observed outcome, is assumed to drive learning, which is the building of associations between antecedent events and rewarding stimuli. fMRI activity in the ventral striatum has been shown to follow the reward prediction error in humans (Abler et al., 2006; Berns et al., 2001; Daw et al., 2006; Hare et al., 2008; McClure et al., 2003; O'Doherty et al., 2003, 2004; Pagnoni et al., 2002).  Models of reinforcement  learning are extremely useful  for explaining the gradual learning of stimulus–response habits, yet learning can occur in various ways. One of the most studied forms of human learning is category learning, which is learning to interpret a wide range of stimuli in terms of a limited number of responses (Ashby et al., 1998; Seger et al., 2000). Research on the neural bases of category learning has mainly focused on paradigms that require the viewing of a stimulus and a categorization response from the observer, after which corrective feedback is provided (Ashby and Maddox, 2005). For this paradigm, which is very similar to instrumental reinforcement learning, the central role of the striatum is well supported. Yet, although feedback-based learning is the most effective training for complex category structures, these can also be  3458  R. Daniel, S. Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  learned by observational learning where observers are merely exposed to a stimulus and are told about its associated category label (Ashby et al., 2002; Cincotta and Seger, 2007; Shohamy et al., 2004). Because in ecologically valid situations feedback might not be immediately available after each decision (Hogarth, 2006), the question that arises is which mechanisms support learning in the absence of feedback. At least two ﬁndings indicate that internal signals on potential outcome are present during learning and might therefore be used to promote learning in the absence of external outcome information: humans have been shown to code the most probable outcome of nonfeedback trials into memory (Henriksson et al., 2010), and are capable of generating internal error signals that lead to activations in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a dopaminergic target region (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004). Thus, in the absence of feedback, knowledge of the structure of the environment may be used to dynamically self-generate an internal signal on probable outcome which then drives dopaminergic responses in a similar way as external outcome information. Such a mechanism would support adaptation to the environment whenever the internal model is correct or a sufﬁcient proportion of decisions receive feedback to update it.  The present experiment set out to test the hypothesis that dopaminergic target regions are activated by internal signals and therefore might contribute to learning in the absence of feedback. To this end we employed a standard information-integration category learning task. In feedback-based learning this task activates dopaminergic projection sites (Daniel and Pollmann, 2010; Nomura et al., 2007) including the striatum and dmPFC, and patients suffering from diseases impairing striatal functioning show impaired performance (Filoteo et al., 2001). Eighteen participants underwent extensive observational training on stimulus category membership in four sessions within one week. Between the observational blocks they were asked to categorize test stimuli without feedback. fMRI data was acquired during the ﬁrst and last sessions. Dopaminergic neurons have also been shown to respond to stimulus novelty (Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006; Daw et al., 2006). Thus, decreasing activations with learning might be due to the increasing familiarity of the stimuli without any relation to feedback processes. We therefore expected striatal activation during the observation of stimuli to decrease with increasing exposure to the stimuli. However, if participants are able to internally generate signals on potential errors during the test blocks, comparing correct to incorrect answers should lead to similar activation differences as comparing positive to negative feedback in feedback-based learning (see Daniel and Pollmann (2010) for results on the same task). For a further examination of the underlying mechanisms we assessed the putative internal signals on probable outcome by explicitly asking subjects to indicate after each trial how conﬁdent they were about their last decision. Within this framework the subjective conﬁdence can be interpreted as a measure of internal processes which are either rewarding themselves, since they indicate correct task performance, or a signal for the possibility of future reward. As dopaminergic neurons do not respond to the absolute magnitude of reward but to deviations from the expected reward (Schultz et al., 1997), we inserted the conﬁdence rating as outcome into a standard reinforcement learning model. This allowed us to estimate the expected outcome, that is the expected level of conﬁdence, on each trial. If the striatum is activated during observational category learning due to internal signals on the correctness of the outcome, striatal activations are expected follow the prediction error on conﬁdence, that is the difference of the expected and the actual conﬁdence.  Methods  Participants  Guericke University community participated in the experiment. All of them were right-handed as conﬁrmed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldﬁeld, 1971) and reported normal or corrected to normal vision. No participant reported a history of drug abuse, neurological injuries or psychiatric diseases and all were without pathological ﬁndings on a psychiatric screening questionnaire (SCL-90-R (Franke, 1995)). Informed written consent was obtained prior to the experiment in accordance with protocols approved by the local ethics committee. All participants received an allowance of 36 €.  Materials  The task employed in the current experiment was based on the randomization technique (Ashby and Gott, 1988). Two parallel sets of stimuli were developed to both establish independence of the results from the speciﬁc properties of the presented materials and to increase comparability to a previous experiment (Daniel and Pollmann, 2010). Half of the participants were presented with circles with an opening of 30° width, the other half with two parallel lines. Both sets varied on the dimensions linewidth and orientation, which formed the two-dimensional stimulus space. Two categories were deﬁned within this space by specifying a bivariate normal distribution for each. The category membership of a stimulus was determined by the distribution it was sampled from. To obtain the stimuli for each category, ordered pairs (x, y) were randomly sampled and linearly transformed separately for all experimental blocks so that the sample mean vector and variance–covariance matrix ﬁt the parameter values of the category distribution (listed in Table 1). These pairs were subsequently transformed to determine the line width (x∕2 pixels) and orientation (y×π∕1200 rad) of each stimulus. Transformation parameters were chosen in an attempt to equate the salience of both stimulus dimensions. The resulting category structure is depicted along with example stimuli in Fig. 1.  Procedure  All participants performed four sessions on separate days, during the ﬁrst and last of which fMRI data was acquired. The fMRI sessions were conducted spaced at an interval of one week. Between them each participant underwent two training sessions during which only behavioral data was acquired. Within each session two tasks, an observational task and a test task, were presented in blocks in an alternating manner. Each session started with a block of observational trials in which ﬁrst a category label was presented for 500 ms and was directly followed by a stimulus. The next trial began after an intertrial interval (ITI) that was sampled from an exponential distribution with a mean of 6 s [range=1–12 s] in the fMRI sessions and a mean of 3.5 s [range=1–6 s] in the training sessions. Participants were instructed to closely observe the provided examples and attend to both linewidth and orientation to learn which stimuli belong to which category. When learning by observational training, participants are often required to press the button associated with the stimulus to ensure that sufﬁcient attention is paid and that a motor association between stimuli and responses is build. Actively making right responses could induce associative learning, which is a possible confound we wanted to eliminate. Also, motor associations during observational information-integration learning do not signiﬁcantly  Table 1 Category distribution parameters.

During the fMRI sessions, two blocks of observation alternated with two blocks of testing with 50 trials in each block. In the training sessions, four blocks of observation, each with 50 trials, alternated with four blocks of testing composed of 25 trials, so that the overall amount of test trials was the same in fMRI and training sessions, however participants observed twice as many stimuli in the training sessions. A visualization of both an observational and a test trial as well as of the structure of the whole experiment is provided in Fig. 2. Please note that participants never received any feedback during the whole experiment.  Model-based analysis  Categorization tasks in which information has to be integrated predecisionally are often not well learned in the absence of feedback (Ashby et al., 2002). To determine whether participants were able to learn the experimenter-deﬁned category structure, model-ﬁtting procedures as developed by Maddox and Ashby (1993) and described in detail in Daniel and Pollmann (2010) were applied to the locations of each participant's responses in the two-dimensional stimulus space separately for each day. One model assumed that participants decided according to the optimal information-integration rule. Two additional models assumed that participants were using unidimensional rules. The latter models ﬁt the data in those participants that based their decisions either solely on the orientation or solely on the linewidth of the stimuli. Also, two models assuming participants used a conjunctive rule were ﬁt. These rules can be formulated as “Respond A if the stimuli are oriented to the right and are thick, otherwise respond B” or, for the other model, as “Respond B if the stimuli are oriented to the left and are thin, otherwise respond A”. The parameters for each model were estimated using the method of maximum likelihood (Ashby, 1992) and the Akaike information criterion (Akaike, 1974) was used as a goodness-of-ﬁt statistic to select the best ﬁtting model for each data set.  Reinforcement learning model  Behavioral data from all participants was modeled using a simple Q-learning model (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Watkins, 1989). The model consists of two input and two output nodes and assumes that participants update the value Q of a choice ct (= respond A or B) given a stimulus on each trial t (see also Rodriguez et al., 2006). Values Q were initialized to zero and updated after each trial  Fig. 1. Category structures and sample stimuli. Each square denotes the orientation and linewidth of a single stimulus from category A, a triangle those of a stimulus from Category B. The optimal decision bound is represented by the line, all stimuli above it are members of Category A, and all stimuli below it are members of Category B. To establish independence of the results from speciﬁc stimulus properties half of the participants was presented with circular stimuli, the other half with lines. For both types of stimuli used in the experiment examples of three stimuli from each category are shown.  inﬂuence accuracy rates or the decision bound used by participants in test blocks (Ashby et al., 2002). Therefore there was no further behavioral task in the observational blocks. Each observational block was followed by a block of test trials where ﬁrst a stimulus was presented for 2 s. During this period, participants were required to indicate category membership of the presented stimulus as soon as they were reasonably conﬁdent about their decision by pressing one of two response keys. After a variable delay sampled from an exponential distribution [M=2 s; range=.5–6 s], the numbers 1 to 5 appeared on the screen for 2 s. Participants were instructed to press one of ﬁve buttons to indicate how conﬁdent they were about their last decision on a scale from 1 (very unconﬁdent) to 5 (very conﬁdent). An additional button was provided to indicate that they had accidentally pressed a wrong button during the last trial. When the participants used this button, the trial was excluded from further analysis to prevent error-related activity caused by speeded responding to inﬂuence the results. After an ITI that was sampled from an exponential distribution [fMRI session: M=6 s, range=1–12 s; training session:  Fig. 2. Procedure. Each participant performed four sessions on different days, the ﬁrst and last of which were fMRI sessions. fMRI sessions included two blocks of 50 observational trials and test trials, the training sessions included four blocks of 50 observational trials and 25 test trials. An observational trial started with the presentation of category label directly followed by a stimulus. Test trials started with a stimulus to which participants were requested to respond with a decision about its category membership. After a variable delay they rated how conﬁdent they were about their last decision. No feedback was provided during the whole experiment.  3460  R. Daniel, S.

A temporal highpass ﬁlter of 1/128 Hz was applied to remove low frequency confounds and all images were smoothed by a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. All coordinates are reported in MNI space.  δt represents the prediction and is as computed as  Statistical analysis of the fMRI data  δt ¼ rt−Q t ctð  Þ  with rt being the received reward at trial t. On test trials, the value for reward that was input into the model was the reported conﬁdence level, which was linearly scaled to lie between 0 and 1. On observational trials the conﬁdence (and therefore reward) was assumed to be 1. Weights from the input nodes (stimulus from category A or B) to the output nodes (answer “A” or “B”) were updated on each trial according to the stimuli presented and choices made. As on test trials the choice could be wrong with a high conﬁdence, also weights on the path from the input node stimulus A to the output node response B and vice versa could be strengthened.  To estimate the free learning rate parameter, it was assumed that participants choose probabilistically from a softmax distribution (Daw, 2011):  P ct ¼ A ð  jQ t Að Þ; Q t Bð ÞÞ ¼  ð exp β·Q t Að Þ Þ þ exp β·Q t Bð Þ  exp β·Q t Að Þ Þ ð  ð  Þ :  The free parameter β is the inverse temperature parameter which can be interpreted as reﬂecting the randomness of the individual's choices. It cannot be assumed that observational learning follows identical rules as learning from the putative internal signal on correctness, therefore α was allowed to be different for observational and test trials. As the models were ﬁt to generate model-based parametric modulators for the imaging analysis based on the prediction error rather than comparing the ﬁt of different models, learning rate parameters were constrained to be equal across participants to regularize the individual estimates which are often noisy (Daw et al., 2006), while β was estimated individually for each participant to account for interindividual differences. All free parameters were estimated simultaneously using maximum likelihood estimation with the optimization package of the SciPy toolbox for Python (Jones et al., 2001). The inverse temperature was estimated with a mean of 4.112 (SD=1.020) across participants, the estimated learning rate was .021 during test trials and .005 during observational trials.  fMRI image acquisition and processing  Functional magnetic resonance imaging data was acquired on a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio (Erlangen, Germany) whole body 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner equipped with an 8 channel head coil. Structural images were recorded using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (ﬁeld of view (FOV)=256 mm, matrix size=256×256, 192 sagittal slices (1 mm width)). Subsequently, using a wholebrain T2⁎-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence, functional images were acquired in a single run of approximately 36 min for each imaging session (TE=30 ms, TR=2000 ms, slice thickness=3 mm, slice gap thickness=.3 mm, number of slices=32 (interleaved order), FA=80°, FOV=192 mm×192 mm, matrix size=64×64, inplane resolution=3 mm×3 mm). Processing of the functional images was performed using the statistical parametric mapping software SPM5 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). After discarding the ﬁrst ﬁve images, slice timing correction with the ﬁrst slice as reference and realignment to the mean of all images was performed. The estimated movement parameters were saved and later included as regressors of no interest in all statistical analyses. Images were normalized to MNI space (Evans et al.,  In the ﬁrst analysis step the three regressors of interest represented the observational task as well as correct and incorrect performance of the categorization task separately for both fMRI sessions. An additional regressor represented the time at which the display prompting participants to give the conﬁdence rating was presented. If the participant failed to respond on any trials an additional regressor representing the missed trials was included. The onset of each event was set to the beginning of the visual stimulation, its duration was set to an epoch with the duration of the visual stimulation (see Fig. 2) and convolved with a model of the hemodynamic response function. The regressors were ﬁt separately to the data of each participant using the general linear model (GLM). Data from separate days was treated as different sessions. To test whether the activation in dopaminergic projection sites decreases with stimulus novelty during observation, the regressors for the observational task from the ﬁrst and second fMRI sessions were submitted to a second level random effects analysis with session as a single factor. For the examination of effects of the valence of putative internal signals indicating an outcome, a 2×2 random effects ANOVA with the factors correctness and session was calculated on the regressors for correct and incorrect task performance. Three participants had to be excluded from this analysis because they committed less than two error trials in the trained session. The activation maps of these analyses were thresholded at a level of p b.05 (spatial extent of more than two contiguous voxels), and all reported clusters survived correction for multiple comparisons at the wholebrain level using familywise error rate (FWE) correction (Worsley et al., 1996).  A second GLM analysis was performed to test for the assumption that differential activations during correct and incorrect task performance are attributable to signals following a similar pattern as the prediction error signals during reinforcement learning. The two regressors for correct and incorrect task performance were replaced by a single regressor containing all categorization task events. The duration of these events was set to 2 s and a linear parametric modulation was added to the regressor. The height of this modulator corresponded to the prediction error of the trial computed as described in the section Reinforcement learning model. To increase sensitivity, this analysis was only performed in areas of interest. They comprised the caudate nucleus, the putamen and the nucleus accumbens deﬁned by the HarvardOxford subcortical structural atlas implemented in the FSL-FMRIB Software Library (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac. uk). These areas constitute the striatum and are dopaminergic target regions which have previously been reported to show activation changes as predicted by reinforcement learning models (Niv and Montague, 2009). Additionally, a sphere of 15 mm radius centered on the midbrain (MNI: x=0, y=15, z=9) was included (Aron et al., 2004), as projections from this area are considered to be the source of striatal activations. The fMRI activation map was thresholded at p b.001 and activations were considered signiﬁcant at a level of p b.05 after correction for multiple comparisons at the cluster level.

Daniel, S. Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  3461  reaction times and prediction errors as well as conﬁdence ratings across all days were calculated. The mean of these values was determined using Fisher's z-transformation and tested against zero. The backtransformed mean correlation between reaction time and conﬁdence rating was −.47 [T(17)=−13.10, p b.001]. Please note that there was no correlation between reaction times and prediction errors [r=−.005; T(17)=−.10, p =.92]. This is to be expected since the same level of conﬁdence, associated with a similar reaction time, can be higher than expected at the beginning of the experiment and lower than expected at the end of the experiment. This means that correlations between the fMRI data and the prediction error cannot be caused by reaction time differences. To determine correlations with the error rates, they were calculated separately for each block. Reaction times and conﬁdence ratings were averaged blockwise analogously. Error rates correlated signiﬁcantly with both mean conﬁdence ratings [r=−.78; T(17)=−10.80, p b.001] and mean reaction times [r =.53; T(17)=5.05, p b.001].  Model-based analysis  Participants learning an information-integration categorization task by observation often do not employ the optimal decision bound depicted in Fig. 1, but rather a suboptimal strategy relying on explicit verbal rules (Ashby et al., 2002). As different neural substrates are supposed to underlie implicit and explicit learning (Ashby and Maddox, 2005), model-ﬁtting procedures were applied to each participant's response data separately for each session to infer the most probable strategy. Results indicate that in the ﬁrst session the data of three of the 18 participants was best ﬁt by a unidimensional model, the data of eleven participants was best ﬁt by a conjunction model and only ﬁve participants employed the optimal rule. From the third session on this relationship was reversed and all but one of the participants employed the optimal rule, indicating successful learning of the experimenter-deﬁned category structure. The numbers and percentages of participants best ﬁt by each model are depicted in Fig. 3.  Functional imaging results  Comparing right and wrong answers in the categorization task  In the naïve session activations were higher for right than wrong answers mainly bilaterally in the putamen, but clusters in the caudate body, nucleus accumbens and posterior parahippocampal gyrus were also observed. In this session no clusters showed higher activation for wrong than for right answers. In the trained session this, however, was observed in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior insula and the midbrain. Here, no clusters showed higher activations for right than for wrong answers (Table 2, Fig. 5). Despite this interaction between the factors session and correctness no signiﬁcant main effect of session was observed, indicating that there was no signiﬁcant increase or decrease in activation for correct or wrong answers between sessions.  Parametric modulation by the prediction error  To estimate the trial-by-trial prediction error we ﬁt a reinforcement learning model to the participants' behavioral choices. The model estimates the expected outcome of each option given the present stimulus for every trial based on the sequence of previous outcomes. Outcome was quantiﬁed by the conﬁdence ratings as reported after each trial, and the prediction error as the difference between the actual and the expected outcome (see Methods).  Results show that within our areas of interest (striatum, midbrain) the putamen and nucleus accumbens showed linearly increasing activation with an increasing prediction error on conﬁdence. This indicates that activation was higher whenever the participant reported to be more conﬁdent on the trial than could be expected from the participants' own history of responses and lower when he or she reported to be less conﬁdent (Table 3, Fig. 6).

The number and percentage of participants best ﬁt by models assuming the participant used a unidimensional, conjunctive or information-integration decision bound. All results are corrected for the number of free parameters. From the third session on all but one participant used the ideal information-integration decision bound, indicating that the complex categorization task was learned after a sufﬁcient number of observational training trials in the absence of external feedback.  data of all 18 participants was subjected to a 4 ×2 ANOVA with repeated measures on session and the type of stimuli (lines or circles) as between-subjects factor. Results showed a signiﬁcant effect of session [F(2.1,34.3) =32.7, p b.001], indicating that the error rates decreased from 25.9% (SD=11.7) in the ﬁrst session to 7.3% (SD=7.0) in the fourth session. No effect of type of stimuli [F(1,16)=.98, p=.34] or interaction of session×type of stimuli [F(2.1, 34.3)=.53, p=.61] was observed. To test for possible behavioral learning effects within the test blocks the means of the ﬁrst and last 20% of trials within each block were compared using multiple T-tests. No signiﬁcant results were observed at the .05 level (uncorrected) (Fig. 4).  Correlations between reaction times, conﬁdence ratings, the prediction error and error rates  For the calculation of the prediction error, which was input as a parametric modulator into the analysis of the functional imaging data, it was assumed that conﬁdence ratings can be treated as a measure of internal signals on correctness. For this assumption to be plausible the conﬁdence ratings should correlate negatively with reaction times and error rates. For each subject Pearson's correlations between  Fig. 4.

For example, activation within the ventral striatum is modulated by social information, prediction errors in the learning of trust and subjective goals during episodic memory retrieval (Behrens et al., 2008; Delgado et al., 2005; Han et al., 2010; King-Casas et al., 2005). Also, distinct but interacting corticostriatal loops have been suggested to underlie both habit learning and goaldirected behavior and jointly contribute to producing complex behavior (Daw and Shohamy, 2008; Valentin et al., 2007).  In everyday life only a small proportion of decisions or judgment taken are followed by immediate feedback (Hogarth, 2006). With such incomplete feedback it is improbable that feedback training is the single prevalent mode of learning in ecologically valid settings. It is not clear whether the dopaminergic system also contributes to learning under circumstances where incomplete or no feedback is provided. We therefore investigated the putative involvement of striatal structures in human category learning in the complete absence of feedback. The results support the idea that these dopaminergic projection sites are activated during observational learning in a similar way as during reinforcement learning, but with respect to self-generated internal signals related to conﬁdence rather than external outcome measures.  l = left, r = right, BA = Brodman area, k = cluster size in voxels (3× 3×3 mm), max. T = maximum T-value.  Striatal activations during observational learning  Within the test phase of the present experiment, when no external information about the category membership was available, the nucleus accumbens and putamen were more activated by correct than incorrect answers. This ﬁnding parallels results from feedbackbased learning, where a similar activation pattern in striatal areas is present during the processing of feedback (for results on a feedback-based version of the same task see Daniel and Pollmann (2010)), but not during categorization. In search for the underlying processes of this result a reinforcement learning model was ﬁt to each participant's data.  According to computational theories of reinforcement learning associative links between stimuli and outcomes are formed and adjusted after each trial (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Sutton, 1988). The mechanism driving associative learning is assumed to be the prediction error, which is the difference between actual and expected outcome. Neurophysiological studies have shown that the prediction error is reﬂected in the behavior of the dopaminergic system (Schultz et al., 1997), i.e. dopaminergic midbrain neurons and their  Fig. 6. fMRI results on the prediction error.

Visualization of the activation in response to the prediction error. Separate regressors were constructed for each quartile of prediction errors in each session, e.g. the regressor for the ﬁrst quartile represents the 25 trials with the lowest prediction error of a given participant in a given session. The mean prediction errors for each quartile resulting from this procedure are given in the axis labels. Negative values indicate that the participant was less conﬁdent than expected, positive values indicate that he or she was more conﬁdent.

Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  Fig. 7. fMRI results from the observational blocks. Activations decreasing with training in the observational task from the ﬁrst to the last session were observed bilaterally in the inferior temporal cortex, in the right ventral striatum and inferior frontal gyrus. No increases in activation were observed in this contrast. Activation maps are thresholded at pFWE b.05.  projection sites. Although the ﬁrst observations on the relevance of the dopaminergic system have been performed in animal studies, its importance for reinforcement learning in humans has received considerable support from studies using fMRI. At this point it has to be noted that fMRI is mainly sensitive to local ﬁeld potentials which reﬂect integrated activity over large neural populations. This signal is assumed to arise mainly from postsynaptic processes caused by input to a region or local interneuron activity (Logothetis, 2003) and is not sensitive to the neurotransmitter system conveying the signals. Due its importance for the investigation of learning, the neurochemistry underlying fMRI activations in the midbrain (substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area) and ventral striatum during reward learning has been explicitly addressed. Pharmacological MRI has shown a positive relationship between the BOLD response measured by fMRI and striatal dopamine levels (Knutson and Gibbs, 2007; Pessiglione et al., 2006) and the parallel use of positron emission tomography showed a quantitative coupling between the BOLD response and individual variability in activity-dependent dopamine release (Schott et al., 2008). Therefore fMRI activity in the ventral striatum during studies of reward learning is most likely related to dopaminergic input to that area, but might also be inﬂuenced by other processes like glutamatergic costimulation. Despite these methodological limitations it is an interesting ﬁnding that the fMRI signal in the striatum responds to reward both during anticipation and outcome in the human striatum (Delgado, 2007; Knutson and Cooper, 2005). Results show that activity in putamen is mainly correlated with stimulus-action-dependent reward prediction (Haruno and Kawato, 2006). This ﬁnding ﬁts in well with the known anatomy of the corticostriatal systems. The putamen is connected with motor areas and therefore in a suitable location to integrate reward expectation with processes that mediate actions to obtain the reward (Haruno and Kawato, 2006; Seger et al., 2010). The ventral striatum on the other hand is connected with orbitofrontal and ventromedial cortex areas known to be involved in the processing of reward and motivation (Haber and Knutson, 2009; Seger et al., 2010). Ventral striatal activity is consistently modulated by the reward prediction error as estimated by reinforcement learning models (Brovelli et al., 2008; Daw and Doya, 2006; Dayan and Niv, 2008; Rangel et al., 2008; Schönberg et al., 2007).  In the present experiment, there were no external reward signals present, however participants reported their conﬁdence in their last decision after each trial as a conscious measure of internally generated signals indicating an assumed success or failure. During categorization, activity in the putamen and nucleus accumbens was signiﬁcantly modulated by the prediction error as estimated from a standard reinforcement learning model in which the conﬁdence rating was input into the model instead of an external reward signal. Possibly due to the postsynaptic origin of the fMRI signal no signiﬁcant modulation of midbrain activity was observed.  Previous results indicate that the knowledge of correct task performance activates the ventral striatum similarly as the receipt of primary or secondary reinforcers, if this information is conveyed by external feedback (Aron et al., 2004; Daniel and Pollmann, 2010; Rodriguez et al., 2006). The current results support the supposition that in the absence of external rewards activation in the striatum can be driven by a prediction error on conﬁdence that utilizes internally generated error signals. Findings from two major lines of research argue for the validity of this conclusion.  First, according to standard reinforcement learning models, only information that is provided by external outcome feedback is coded into memory. However, cognitive psychology has shown that humans tend to reconstruct missing information using top-down processes. These inferences are often used in the same manner as external information (White and Koehler, 2004) and the ability to distinguish between real and inferred information is limited (Roediger et al., 2001). In the case of selectively missing outcome information, humans have been shown to actively construct the most likely outcome of the trial and code it into memory (Elwin et al., 2007; Henriksson et al., 2010). At times, this approach can be misleading, so that no behavioral improvements are observable, or it can even lead to deterioration in performance due to the strengthening of false conceptions without any external evidence. However, in many cases a good internal representation of the environment is available and outcome information is scarce or costly to obtain. Under these circumstances the application of previous knowledge can be the most adaptive or only way to promote further learning.  Second, a large body of literature provides evidence for the ability of the brain to generate error signals without external feedback. The dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is known not only to respond to unfavorable performance outcomes but also pre-response conﬂict, decision uncertainty and response errors before external feedback (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004). Theoretical accounts for these experimental results have suggested that the performance monitoring system makes use of dopaminergic signals carrying reward prediction errors to determine the outcome of ongoing behavior and indicate the need for the recruitment of adaptive cognitive control mechanisms (Holroyd and Coles, 2002; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004; Rushworth and Behrens, 2008). The pharmacokinetics of dopamine in the cortex makes it improbable that fast activation changes in the dmPFC are a direct effect of dopaminergic signals from the midbrain rather than a remote effect possibly mediated by the striatum, indicating that cortical dopamine only modulates the effects of other neurotransmitter systems. However, there is a close interaction between performance monitoring reﬂected in the dmPFC, prediction errors reﬂected in striatal activation and dopamine release in the midbrain. Moreover, there are indications that performance monitoring might involve top-down modulation of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, also via pathways through the striatum (Jocham and Ullsperger, 2009; Ullsperger, 2006, 2010). The performance  R. Daniel, S. Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  3465  monitoring system can be informed by different sources about real or potential errors: it can utilize external signals, like punishments or the omission of rewards, but also internal sources, like the detection of competing response tendencies. The error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential which has a dipole source in the dmPFC (Debener et al., 2005), has a functional interrelation with a very similar event-related potential sharing the same neural sources (Gentsch et al., 2009), the feedback-related negativity (FRN). When participants are able to generate knowledge about an error without external feedback, an ERN but no FRN is observed, while information that is not available prior to the feedback elicits only the FRN (Heldmann et al., 2008). This is compatible with the assumption that, whenever an external outcome signal provides additional information, it elicits a prediction error signal. However, internal error signals are generated whenever possible before the feedback arrives, which is then used to elicit the prediction error signal.  Activation of the dmPFC and anterior insula in response to errors  In line with prediction error models, after extensive training no higher activation for correct than incorrect task performance in striatal areas was observed. At this stage, the midbrain, posterior medial prefrontal areas and the anterior insula showed higher activation in response to incorrect than correct answers. This result is also paralleled by similar ﬁndings in the literature on feedback-based learning where this activation pattern, however, is observed already early in training (Aron et al., 2004; Daniel and Pollmann, 2010; Grinband et al., 2006; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004). The dmPFC has been identiﬁed as the source of the ERN Debener et al. (2005) and together with the anterior insula has been shown to respond not only to response errors, but also to increase linearly in activation with response uncertainty (Daniel et al., 2011). Also, the anterior insula has been associated with conscious errors (Craig, 2009). Both the distinct difference in uncertainty for right and wrong answers as well as the explicit knowledge about it might arise only later in observational learning, when the knowledge of the task structure has reached a certain level of proﬁciency, while in the presence of feedback it is available as soon as the feedback is delivered. However, as there was no significant difference between the activation in response to wrong answers in the ﬁrst and last session, this observation has to be supported by data from further experiments.  Decrease in ventral striatal activation with familiarity  Activation within the nucleus accumbens decreased with training during the observation of the stimuli. This decrease cannot be elicited by any form of internal signals relating to conﬁdence since the category label was presented before the stimulus and no categorization response was required. Stimulus novelty is known to activate dopaminergic structures, and might have rewarding properties in itself or be interpreted as a cue for potential reward (Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006; Daw et al., 2006). This mechanism can have positive consequences for the organism, since it leads to exploring new options instead of exploiting those that have already proven to have a high utility. Thus valuable information about more proﬁtable options can be attained, which in turn increases future rewards. Although in the present experiment new category members were presented within each block, they were all drawn from the same distribution, which increases familiarity with the stimuli later in training. While the observed higher activations in response to correct than incorrect categorization cannot be attributed to stimulus novelty, since classiﬁcation accuracy should be higher for subjectively familiar stimuli than subjectively novel ones, ventral striatal activation during observation early in learning might signal salience and therefore support the allocation of attention to unfamiliar category members.  The use of subjective ratings as conﬁdence measure and the potential origin of the conﬁdence signal  The literature on metacognition provides examples for errors of calibration in subjective ratings on post-decisional conﬁdence in a wide variety of tasks. These range from perceptional discrimination tasks over general knowledge questions to giving eyewitness accounts and unambiguously show that subjective conﬁdence often does not predict task performance (Baranski and Petrusic, 1999; Sporer et al., 1995; Zakay and Tuvia, 1998). Depending on the speciﬁc task and its difﬁculty participants often over- or underestimate the correctness or their decisions. In the present task participants had to infer the structure of a categorization task by observing examples for each category and in subsequent test trials were asked for a conﬁdence rating immediately after their decision. Both error rates and reaction times were highly correlated with these conﬁdence ratings, indicating that for this speciﬁc task post-decisional subjective conﬁdence ratings are a sensible measure of the internal processes leading to the decision. Also, the use of a prediction error model greatly reduces the demands on the measure, since only intraindividual deviations from an expectation, which is calculated from the weighted ratings of past trials, are considered. Therefore it is only required that participants respond consistently, predominantly on trials closer together in time. Nevertheless, it has to be noted that subjective conﬁdence ratings strongly build on the human ability for metacognition, and processes that are not accessible to it are not captured by this measure (Allwood et al., 2000).  Observational category learning has been suggested to be supported by visual working memory processes and executive attention (Ashby et al., 2002). In the present experiment we observed a decrease in activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex from untrained to trained observation, an area that is often associated with working memory (D'Esposito et al., 2000) and the representation of rules and goals (Miller and Cohen, 2001). Later in training increased activation in the dmPFC, an area that is also activated by response conﬂict (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004), was observed for wrong compared to right answers. Taking these previous ﬁndings into account low conﬁdence in the present experiment might be caused by encountering exemplars that do not ﬁt the internal model of category structure held in working memory and therefore induce response conﬂict. However, as the present study was aimed at establishing the role of internal error signals in learning in the absence of feedback rather than determining their origin, these considerations can only provide hypotheses.  Possible roles of the prediction error on conﬁdence in learning  In the present experiment no reward or cognitive feedback was associated with the stimuli at any stage. Nevertheless, ventral striatal areas that are known to respond to reward prediction errors showed an increased activation whenever internal signals informed the participants that they were more conﬁdent about their decision as expected, and a decreased activation when they were less conﬁdent about their decision.  This internal signal might serve two distinct but overlapping purposes. In a learning environment where no external feedback is available, any mechanism that assesses current task performance can only be informed by internal signals. Therefore, the internal error signal might substitute for external feedback processes. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the activation patterns observed when comparing correct to incorrect task performance are equivalent to those observed when comparing positive to negative feedback on the same task when external feedback is available (see Daniel and Pollmann, 2010).  Additionally, reinforcement theories predict that detection of stimuli which change the probability of receiving reward elicits a  3466  R. Daniel, S. Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  prediction error (Niv and Schoenbaum, 2008). Although participants were informed that no reward or feedback would be given within the experiment, it is plausible to assume that acquiring the ability to map the structure of the environment is inherently interpreted as increasing the probability of receiving reward within that environment (Kaplan and Oudeyer, 2004). Seeing an exemplar that can be categorized with lower conﬁdence than expected can serve as a signal that the model of the environment is wrong and needs to be updated, while higher conﬁdence than expected indicates that the state of the environment has changed toward a higher probability of reward. This interpretation predicts a stronger violation of expectations and therefore more learning whenever conﬁdent responses are followed by negative feedback. Such an overcorrection effect has been observed in the domain of explicit knowledge before (Butterﬁeld and Metcalfe, 2006).  Summary  Within the last decade, broad-ranging efforts have been made to extend results on reinforcement learning and the role of dopamine therein to the human domain. Using fMRI many results from animal studies could be replicated. The striatum has been shown to respond to reward value and prediction error both in classical and instrumental conditioning tasks (O'Doherty et al., 2007). However, in ecologically valid settings after many decisions reward or outcome information is not available or very costly to obtain. The present experiment has been conducted to explore a possible role of dopaminergic projection areas in situations where information about correctness has to be internally constructed. The results demonstrate two distinct possible mechanisms by which learning in the absence of external rewards can be supported by the striatum. In the complete absence of feedback, striatal activation follows a similar pattern in responding to the prediction error as it does during reinforcement learning, but with respect to signals based on subjective conﬁdence, that is activation is higher whenever conﬁdence is higher than expected. A potential source for these activations lies within the error monitoring system. Internally detected errors might be interpreted either as source of information on performance outcome similarly as errors detected due to external feedback, or indicate that the state of the environment, which signals the probability of future reward, has changed. The process leads to an overall higher activation in striatal nuclei during correct than incorrect task performance similarly as external performance feedback does. Additionally, when no actions are performed and stimuli are passively observed, ventral striatal activation decreases with stimulus novelty.  Outlook  Patients with Parkinson's disease are impaired on feedback-based complex category learning tasks, while observational learning is spared (Shohamy et al., 2004). This can be interpreted to show that in observational learning performance is possible without the recruitment of striatal structures (Shohamy et al., 2008). However, our results demonstrate that healthy young participants do recruit these structures during observational learning in the complete absence of feedback in at least two distinct ways, namely in response to novelty and internal signals on conﬁdence about the decision. The latter process can support learning but, in the absence of external information, also strengthen false associations. Whether each of the processes is necessary or sufﬁcient for task performance and how the processing of internal and external outcome information interacts in ecologically valid settings, where outcome information is partially available, are subject to further research.

Experiment 1 examined the common and distinct neural bases of direct appraisals of the self, close others, and normative judgments of trait desirability. All three judgment types activated medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) to a similar degree. Experiment 2 examined the common and distinct neural bases of (1) direct appraisals of self, a close other or a non-close other, and (2) reflected appraisals made from the perspective of a close or a non-close other. Consistent with Experiment 1, all types activated MPFC. Direct appraisals of the self as compared to others more strongly recruited MPFC and right rostrolateral PFC. Direct appraisals as compared to reflected appraisals recruited regions associated with a first-person perspective (posterior cingulate), whereas reflected as compared to direct appraisals recruited regions associated with emotion and memory (insula, orbitofrontal, and temporal cortex). These results support models suggesting that MPFC mediates meta-cognitive processes that may be recruited for direct and reflected self appraisals depending upon the demands of a specific task.

Am I friendly? Am I outgoing? Am I aggressive or anxious or eager? To answer these  F seen  _  questions, contemporary social psychological theories suggest that there are at least two appraisals of the self upon which we draw (Baumeister, 1998; Fiske, 2004; Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Shrauger and Schoeneman, 1999). Direct appraisals draw primarily upon semantic self-knowledge abstracted from previous experiences, although in some cases, self appraisals might draw upon episodic knowledge of specific life events (Kihlstrom et al., 2003; Klein et al., 1989, 1996; Markus, 1977; Tulving et al., 1988). By contrast, reflected appraisals draw on our beliefs about how we are seen by others. The person in reflected appraisals has been termed ‘‘The Looking Glass Self’’ (Cooley, 1902; Mead, 1934).1 For much of the past century, behavioral researchers have asked two distinct but related questions about the mechanisms underlying direct and reflected appraisals. The first question is whether direct appraisals of the self are insofar as they draw upon different informational bases and inferential processes used to directly appraise other individuals. For example, it is possible that evaluating your own friendliness recruits highly accessible memory representations that are more structured and complex than those used to evaluate the friendliness of a work colleague (Dweck et al., 2003; Higgins and Bargh, 1987; Symons and Johnson, 1997). At best, there is mixed evidence to support this claim. On one hand, memory is enhanced for traits evaluated in relation to the self in comparison to other targets. This memory advantage has been argued to reflect something about the unique organizational structure of self-knowledge (Maki and McCaul, 1985; McCaul and Maki, 1984; Rogers et al., 1977). On the other hand, similar levels of memory are observed for stimuli whose representations are equated for complexity of organization and/or elaboration (Klein and Kihlstrom, 1986; Symons and Johnson, 1997).  _ special,  special  F  F  _  * Corresponding author.

Available online on ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com).  1 A variant on this second possibility is that self-knowledge derives not just partially, but almost completely from our perceptions of others (Cooley, 1902; Lewin, 1951; Mead, 1934; cf. Bem, 1967).  1053-8119/$ - see front matter D 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.06.069  798  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  The second question is to what extent direct and reflected appraisals – which are often conceptualized as distinct processes – may share similar inferential and informational bases. For example, our beliefs about what others think of us could be based on our own beliefs about ourselves. Research suggests that reflected appraisals are correlated more strongly with direct self appraisals than they are with actual feedback from others (Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Krueger, 2003). This suggests that reflected appraisals may reflect our own beliefs about ourselves more than they reflect accurate knowledge about others’ views.  this may be the case:  Although no prior  functional neuroimaging work has included both direct and reflected appraisals, the results of studies examining each in isolation can be used to formulate predictions about the common and distinct neural correlates of self appraisals. To examine direct self the two types of  Table 1 Judgment conditions included in studies of self-reference and perspective taking  Target of belief  Perspective  the self-reference effect  appraisals, some studies have adapted methodological techniques from studies of in memory. This approach contrasts self-descriptive judgments with other types of judgment to isolate neural systems associated specifically with the access of information about the self. As illustrated in Table 1, comparison conditions have included judging traits of familiar persons (i.e., a political figure, a close other), judging the social desirability of the words possess some perceptual characteristic unrelated to their meaning. Results have suggested that self-reference may be both and ordinary: greater MPFC activation is found when judging whether trait words describe the self as compared to a non-close other (George Bush), but both types of judgments recruit other regions involved in memory retrieval, such as left inferior prefrontal to the same degree as the other-referential cortex (PFC), judgments (Kelley et al., 2002; Macrae et al., 2004).

Text in italics indicates the instructions given in the present experiments for specific types of direct and reflected appraisals. Targets are the individuals about whom thoughts/beliefs/feelings are held and judgments are made. Perspectives refer to the person _ who holds the thought/belief/feeling. Among studies examining judgments about what would be believed by another person (i.e., what is believed from their perspective), only the present Experiments 1 and 2 involve reflected appraisals of the beliefs that another person holds about you, the experimental participant (see text for full description of conditions in present experiments). In this context, a normative perspective is a form of reflected appraisal that of beliefs nor a specific target of them. Superscripted numerals indicate: 1Judging whether a trait adjective describes you involves neither a specific (yes/no); 2judging your own emotional response to a photo or the emotion expressed by a figure in the photo; 3judging what you believe or the average person would believe about medical/health issues; 4predicting either your own or your mother’s emotional reactions to an event; 5judging what you believe or a vignette character believes about an event described in the vignette; 6judging social desirability of trait; 7judging positivity of trait.

Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  799  activation has been reported during similar kinds of selfreferential assessment (Craik et al., 1999; Fossati et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2002) as well as during other types of selfreflective processing that involve awareness of one’s own current thoughts or feelings (e.g., Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Lieberman et al., 2004; McGuire et al., 1996; Ochsner et al., 2004). On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that MPFC may play a special role in mediating access to self-knowledge in general (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Kelley et al., 2002; Macrae et al., 2004). Other findings suggest, however, that self-reference may involve other regions as well. For example, self-referential processing has been associated with activity in posterior cingulate/precuneus (Fossati et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2002; Kircher et al., 2002; Schmitz et al., 2004) and is disrupted by transcranial magnetic stimulation over this region (Lou et al., 2004). Furthermore, some studies have failed to show greater MPFC activation, observing instead activation in lateral prefrontal or parietal systems (Kircher et al., 2002; Schmitz et al., 2004).  Two studies of self-reference included normative appraisals of trait desirability. The first observed greater MPFC activity for self appraisals compared to appraisals of the positivity of trait adjectives (Schmitz et al., 2004), and the second found similar patterns of MPFC activity for self appraisals and appraisals of trait desirability (Fossati et al., 2003). Four other studies have directly compared first-person (what I think/feel) as compared to third-person (what another person thinks/feels) judgments about beliefs and feelings that are not directly related to the self. Three of these studies suggest that greater MPFC activation is associated with judging another’s beliefs or emotions as compared to judging either one’s own belief or emotions (Ruby and Decety, 2003, 2004; Vogeley et al., 2001) or non-mentalistic baseline judgments (Ochsner et al., 2004). One study found greater MPFC activation for self than for other judgments, however, and that other judgments activated left lateral PFC (Ochsner et al., 2004). More generally, studies comparing mental and non-mental state inferences about others have found MPFC activation along with other regions including the superior temporal sulcus, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and temporal pole (for review, see (Adolphs, 2003; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Ochsner et al., 2004).  The preceding review presents a complex and somewhat contradictory picture of the relationship between specific brain systems and direct or reflected appraisals of the self. On one hand, it is possible that there are consistent neural correlates of each type of appraisal, but the ability to detect them may have been obscured by methodological shortcomings. For example, in prior work, the degree of familiarity has not been systematically manipulated, which could influence recruitment of brain systems. On the other hand, extant results do suggest that MPFC, as well as a number of other commonly activated posterior medial and temporal regions, plays a role in drawing inferences about enduring traits and mental states. Therefore, they may play important roles in both direct and reflected appraisals about the self concept.  relationship intimacy or  The specific question addressed by the present research is: what exactly are those roles? Complexities and inconsistencies aside, prior research suggests three possibilities. The first is that MPFC (or some subregions of it, as well as allied medial and temporal regions) supports inferences about one’s own current states and dispositions, perhaps because MPFC supports access to internal cues available only for one’s own mental states (Gusnard et al., 2001; Kelley et al., 2002; Ochsner et al., 2004). The second is that  MPFC is involved specifically in adopting the perspective of and/ or making judgments about the mental states of other people (Ruby and Decety, 2003, 2004). The third possibility is that MPFC performs computations common to both of these processes, including those involved in meta-cognitive judgments that require explicit representation of what one knows (Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Lieberman and Pfeifer, in press; Ochsner et al., 2004). In this case, activation in MPFC (and allied regions) may depend upon the meta-cognitive processing demands intrinsic to a specific experimental situation.  The present studies address these possibilities using functional magnetic resonance imaging in two experiments that systematically varied the target of judgments about personality (thereby varying the kind of personal knowledge accessed) as well as the first or third-person perspective taken when making those judgments (thereby varying direct versus reflected appraisals). this study was the opportunity to A particular strength of compare results from two experiments that included both overlapping and distinct task conditions and statistical analyses but used slightly different experimental methods and data collected from different scanners. Comparing and contrasting patterns of activation across two experiments that systematically varied task conditions should provide converging evidence concerning the common and distinct processes underlying the direct and reflected routes to self-knowledge.  Experiment 1  Experiment 1 addresses two specific questions concerning the neural systems specifically recruited during direct appraisals of one’s own self concept. First, we asked whether judging one’s own personality traits is similar to judging the traits of a close other with whom one has a great deal of information/experience. Second, we asked whether making self-assessments of personality is similar to making assessments of social desirability. The latter comparison included a condition that required adopting the normative perspective of the ‘‘average person’’ and provided a control condition for the possibility that self appraisals reflect processes that bias us to think positively of ourselves (Robins and Beer, 2001; Taylor and Brown, 1988).  Methods  Participants  17 Participants (9 female, M age = 29 years) were recruited in compliance with the human subjects regulations of the University of California, Berkeley, and were compensated $15/h for their participation. All participants were screened for medications or psychological and/or neurological conditions that might influence the measurement of cerebral blood flow.  Behavioral paradigm  Participants completed four types of blocks (see Table 1) each comprised of 6 positive and 6 negative trait adjectives drawn from the normed lists of Craik et al. (1999). Word length, number of syllables, valence, and frequency ratings for word types were equated across four stimulus sets that were types. On Self blocks, counterbalanced across four judgment participants were instructed to judge whether the adjective described them. On Other blocks, participants judged whether  800  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  the adjective described a close other that had been identified by each participant before the experiment began. On Positive blocks, participants judged whether each adjective described a trait that most people would consider a positive personality characteristic. On Syllable blocks, participants judged whether the adjective contained two syllables. Each of the 12 trials in each block began with a screen containing an instructional cue above a fixation point for 2.2 s (all timing was TRs). The instructional cue remained but the crosshair was then replaced with a trait adjective for 2.2 s, while participants made a yes/no binary judgment. Participants made their judgments using the thumbs of their left and right hands on a two-button response box. Positive and negative words were presented in an optimized pseudorandom order within blocks with jittered intertrial intervals (ITIs) that varied from 4 to 8 s with an average interval of 5.16 s (Donaldson et al., 2001). The task scans each consisting of 4 comprised four 8-min 56-s pseudorandomly ordered blocks (each lasting 110 s, including 12 4-s trials per block and jittered ITIs) with 24-s fixation rest periods following each block.  that  Stimuli were projected onto a screen mounted on a custom head coil limited head motion using foam padding. Stimulus presentation and response collection were controlled by the program E-prime running on a Windows 98 Computer.  MRI data acquisition  All  images were acquired with a 4-T Varian INOVA MR scanner and a TEM send and receive RF head coil. Functional images were acquired during four runs lasting 536 s each, using a two-shot gradient echo echo-planar image (EPI) sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 2.2 s (echo time of ), resulting in 244 total volumes 28 ms, and flip angle of 20 acquired. Whole brain volumes consisted of twenty 3.5-mm axial slices with a 5-mm interslice gap. Each slice was acquired with a 22.4 cm2 field of view with a 64  64 matrix size, resulting in an in-plane resolution of 3  3 mm. Highresolution (0.875  0.875 mm) in-plane T1-weighted anatomical images were also acquired using a gradient echo multislice (GEMS) sequence for anatomical localization. Finally, MP-Flash 3D T1-weighted scans were acquired so that functional data could be normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas space.  MRI data analysis  All statistical analyses were conducted using SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology). Functional images acquired from the scanner were reconstructed from k space time interpolation algorithm to double the using a linear effective sampling rate. Image volumes were corrected for slice-timing skew using temporal sinc interpolation and corrected for movement using rigid-body transformation parameters. Images were then smoothed with an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel and masked using a full-brain mask to remove extraneous signal as a result of ghosting. To remove drifts within sessions, a high-pass filter with a cutoff period of 200 s was applied.  A fixed effects analysis was used to model both block and event-related responses for each participant. Responses related to the instructional cues and the onset of each positive or negative word stimulus were modeled with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Block-level responses corresponding to each instruction type were modeled using a boxcar regressor convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response. A general linear model analysis then was used to create contrast images for each participant summarizing differences between block types, and these images were used to create group average SPM{t} maps that were thresholded at P < .001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons, with an extent threshold of 5 voxels. This threshold was adopted in both experiments for regions of a priori interest shown prior work to be involved in self-referential and/or social cognitive judgments and the retrieval of episodic memories (including medial and lateral PFC, anterior and posterior cingulate/precuneus, insula, medial and anterior temporal lobe, and superior parietal cortex). Maxima are reported in ICMB152 coordinates as in SPM2.  Results  Behavioral results  Response times for judgments involving the self or a close other were made with similar speed (Self, M = 1322.3 ms; Other, M = 1367.8 ms; t = 1.66, P > 0.10), and both were made more slowly than Positive judgments (Positive M = 1267.0; versus Self, t = 12.55, P < 0.05; versus Other, t = 4.75, P < 0.001).

Neither contrast showed activation of any regions when the threshold was lowered to P < 0.005. At an even more liberal threshold of P < 0.01, activation of MPFC was not observed in either contrast.  Discussion  that  The results of Experiment 1 indicate that in comparison to baseline perceptual judgments of trait adjectives, direct appraisals of the self recruit MPFC, but these regions are no different than those recruited by direct appraisals of a close other or judgments of the normative positivity of trait words. These findings suggest that prior demonstrations of MPFC activity during direct appraisals of the self may have been attributable to their comparison with direct appraisals of nonclose others, such as the US President or Canadian Prime Minister, with whom one has little personal experience and whom one may be quite dissimilar (e.g., Craik et al., 1999; Kelley et al., 2002). Only one prior study has compared directly judgments about self and a close other (Schmitz et al., 2004) and, like the present findings, did not observe greater recruitment of MPFC. However, unlike that study, we did not observe greater activation for Self as compared to Positivity judgments (cf. Fossati et al., 2003).  Experiment 2  Experiment 2 directly and systematically addressed two specific questions concerning direct and reflected appraisals of the self. The first was a follow-up to the finding from the neural systems correlated with direct Experiment 1 that appraisals of the self and a close other were quite similar. Experiment 2 compares direct appraisals of the self with a close other and a non-close other to examine how activation varies with relationship intimacy (cf. Craik et al., 1999; Kelley et al., 2002). The second question concerned the relationship between direct appraisals of the self and reflected appraisals of the self made from the perspective of either the (a) close other or (b) the non-close other. Based on the findings from Experiment 1, we hypothesized that self and close other judgments – including adopting the reflected perspective of a close other on one’s self – should reveal similar patterns of activation because each type of judgment relies upon access to similar/overlapping pools of semantic person knowledge (Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Klein et al., 1997). In contrast, we hypothesized that making judgments about, or adopting the perspective of, a non-close other with whom one is less familiar than a close other could depend upon neural systems different than those involved in self judgments (Klein et al., 1997).  802  Methods  Participants  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  Sixteen participants (9 female, M age = 22.95 years) were recruited in compliance with the human subjects regulations of Stanford University and were compensated $20/h for their participation. All participants were screened for medications or psychological and/or neurological conditions that might influence the measurement of cerebral blood flow.  Behavioral paradigm  Participants completed six types of blocks (see Table 1) each comprised of 4 trials with positive and 4 trials with negative trait adjectives drawn from the stimulus lists employed by Craik et al. (1999). Word length, number of syllables, valence, and frequency ratings for word types were equated across six sets of 8 words each that were counterbalanced across six judgment types. Prior to the onset of each block, one of six instructional cues was presented in the center of the screen twice (using the same timing as regular judgment trials, see below) that indicated which judgment participants were to make for each trait adjective using a four-point scale. On You About Self blocks, participants were instructed to judge the extent to which the adjective described them (1 = not at all; 4 = very much). On You About Friend blocks, participants judged the extent to which the adjective described their best friend and/or relationship partner, whose identity had been specified before the experiment began. On You About Other blocks, participants judged the extent to which each adjective described a non-close individual whose identity had been specified prior to the experiment as a teaching assistant from a class taken the previous semester with whom the participant had not become friends. On Friend About You blocks, participants judged the extent to which their designated close other would judge the adjective to describe them. On Other About You blocks, participants judged the extent to which their designated non-close other would judge the adjective to describe them. On baseline Curved Lines blocks, participants judged the extent to which the adjective contained curved as compared to straight lines (1 = very few, <25% curved; 4 = very many, >75% curved). Each trial began with a fixation point presented in the center of the screen for 250 ms, followed by the stimulus adjective for 1250 ms, a rating scale for 2250 ms that included the instructional cue and labeled endpoints, and finally a 250-ms ITI. Participants made their judgments using the index through little fingers of their dominant right hand on a four button response box with the index finger always corresponding to the maximum response option for each judgment. Pre-block instructional cues were presented using the same event sequence as regular judgment trials with the exception that the fixation crossed was presented instead of a rating scale. Within each block, positive and negative words were presented in a counterbalanced pseudorandom order. To jitter the interval between trial types, a total of 48 fixation trials were distributed throughout the 36 judgment blocks, with the constraint that each block contains at least one fixation trial. Thus, four blocks contained one and two blocks contained two fixation trials that were identical to curved lines trials with the exception that a fixation cross was presented instead of a trait adjective. The entire task was comprised of six functional runs each lasting 6 min 6 s. Each run included one block of each of the seven  for each judgment  type,  types presented in pseudorandom counterbalanced judgment order, with each block comprised of 9 or 10 trials (4 negative, 4 positive, 1 – 2 fixation) that were preceded by 4 s of instructional cue.  Stimuli were projected onto a screen mounted on a custom head coil that limited head motion using a bitebar. Stimulus presentation and response collection were controlled by the program Psycscope v1.2 running on a Macintosh G3 Computer. A separate training and practice session were conducted at the Psychology Department approximately 2 – 5 days prior to the scanning session in order to select close and non-close other individuals and to familiarize participants with the task.  MRI data acquisition  Whole brain fMRI data (28 axial slices, 4 mm thick) were collected at 3 T (GE Signa LX Horizon Echospeed Scanner) with a T2*-sensitive gradient echo spiral-in/out pulse sequence (30 ms TE, 2000 ms TR, 2 interleaves, 60 flip angle, 24-cm field of view, 64  64 data acquisition matrix). T2-weighted flow-compensated spin echo scans were acquired for anatomical reference using the same slice prescription (2000 ms TR; 85 ms TE).  MRI data analysis  All statistical analyses were conducted using SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology). Anatomical images first were coregistered to the mean functional image and normalized to a standard template brain. Functional images were slice time and motion-corrected, normalized to parameters derived from the anatomical normalization, interpolated to 2  2  2 mm voxels, and smoothed with a Gaussian filter (6-mm full width half maximum). To remove drifts within sessions, a high-pass filter with a cutoff period two times the block length (64 s) was applied.  A fixed effects analysis was used to model both block and event-related responses for each participant. The instructional cue proceeding each block was modeled with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Block-level responses corresponding to each instruction type were modeled using a boxcar regressor convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response. A general linear model analysis then was used to create contrast images for each participant summarizing differences between block types, and these images were used to create group average SPM{t} maps that were thresholded as in Experiment 1 at P < 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons, with an extent threshold of 5 voxels. Maxima are reported in ICMB152 coordinates as in SPM2.  Results  Behavioral data  Response times for judgments involving the self or a close other were made with similar speed (You About Self, M = 1240.3 ms; You About Friend, M = 1234.9 ms; Friend About You, M = 1225.4 ms; all planned pairwise t’s < 1). Judgments involving a non-close other and baseline perceptual judgments of curved lines were made with equal speed, and these three judgments were made more slowly than were the three judgments involving the self or close other (You About Other, M = 1296.7 ms; Other About You, M = 1278.9 ms; Curved Lines, M = 1337.9 ms; pairwise t(15) < 1.9, P > 0.08; for comparisons with judgments involving self or close other, planned t’s > 2.3, P < 0.05).  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  803  Imaging data  Regions involved in direct self appraisals that  required accessing different types of person knowledge were identified in the three separate contrasts of You About Self, You About Friend, or You About Other trials > Curved Lines trials. Regions involved in reflected appraisals of the self from the perspective of other people were identified in contrasts of the Friend About You or Other About You trials > Curved Lines trials. All of these contrasts produced strikingly similar patterns of activation, which included regions of MPFC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) spanning their dorsal (BAs 8 – 9) to ventral (BAs 10, 25) extent, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus, inferior parietal cortex, and the middle and inferior temporal gyri and temporal pole. Because these patterns of activation were so similar, in order to streamline presentation of these data, the intersection of all regions activated for each of these contrasts is shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2.  Direct self appraisals recruited regions distinct from those associated with direct appraisals of a friend or non-close other. As shown in the top half of Table 4, the You About Self > You About Friend and You About Self > You About Other contrasts both activated right lateral PFC (Fig. 3a), with the latter contrast additionally activating dorsal MPFC, anterior cingulate, and superior parietal cortex (Fig. 3b). The reverse of those two contrasts identified regions more active when accessing knowledge about a friend or close other as compared to the self. As shown in the bottom half of Table 4, the You About Friend > You About Self contrast activated both dorsal and ventral portions of MPFC as well as anterior cingulate cortex, right anterior insula,  and dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortex bilaterally, whereas the You About Other > You About Self contrast activated primarily the right inferior temporal gyrus, the parahippocampus, and the pons.  Two contrasts identified regions more active when accessing self-knowledge via direct appraisals from a first-person perspective as compared to reflected appraisals from a third-person perspective. As shown in the top half of Table 5 and Fig. 4a, the You About Self > Friend About You contrast activated posterior cingulate cortex. The You About Self > Other About You contrast also activated posterior cingulate cortex as well as the insula and superior parietal cortex. The reverse of those two contrasts identified regions more active when accessing knowledge about the self by reflected as compared to direct appraisals. As shown in the bottom half of Table 5 and Fig. 4b, the Friend About You > You About Self contrast activated right orbital, insular, and parahippocampal cortices, the left lingual gyrus and the cerebellum, whereas the Other About You > You About Self contrast activated middle and inferior temporal gyri and the pons.  Discussion  Experiment 2 addressed two important issues concerning the neural correlates of self-knowledge: whether similar systems mediate access to self-knowledge as compared to knowledge of close or non-close others, and what systems mediate direct and reflected self appraisals. In comparison to baseline perceptual judgments, activation of MPFC was associated (1) with direct  Table 3 Group activations in Experiment 2 commonly recruited by direct and reflected appraisals compared to baseline perceptual judgments  Region of activation  Brodmann  Coordinates  Z score  Superior FG (MPFC) Medial FG (MPFC) Superior FG (MPFC)  Superior FG (MPFC) Subgenual CC (MPFC) Middle FG Posterior CC  Posterior CC Posterior CC/Precuneus  Middle TG  Superior TG  Middle TG  Middle TG  Inferior TG  Inferior TG Middle TG  Inferior TG Temporal Pole Middle TG  Middle TG Superior TG  Inferior TG/Temp.

Top panels show lateral and bottom panels show medial views of the cortical surface. Because these patterns of activation were so similar, in order to streamline presentation of these data, activations represented the intersection of all regions activated for each of five contrasts comparing direct appraisals (You About Self, You About Friend, and You About Other trials) or reflected appraisals (Friend About You, Other About You trials) with activation on baseline Curved Lines trials.  appraisals of trait descriptiveness for the self, close others, and non-close others – a finding that dovetails with and extends the findings of Experiment 1 – and (2) with reflected appraisals about the self made from the third-person perspective of a close or nonclose other.  The striking similarity of activations for the three types of direct appraisal and two types of reflected appraisal are illustrated vividly in Table 3 and Fig. 2, which show common recruitment not only of MPFC, but of a larger network of regions including posterior cingulate/precuneus and multiple regions of the temporal lobe spanning its superior to polar extent. The dual role of these regions in direct and reflected self appraisals fits with prior work showing involvement of MPFC in mental state attribution for both self and other (Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Mitchell et al., 2004; Ochsner et al., 2004), posterior cingulate/precuneus in emotional evaluation and perspective taking (Gallagher et al., 2000; Kelley et al., 2002; Kircher et al., 2002; Lieberman et al., 2004; Maddock et al., 2003; Wicker et al., 2003), and middle and polar temporal regions in representing linguistic and semantic information useful for self-monitoring and person memory (Hashimoto and Sakai, 2003; Paller et al., 2003). Representing mental states, evaluating their valence, shifting between first and third-person perspectives, and retrieving personal attributes from memory all may play an essential role in direct and reflected appraisals.  Experiment 2 was the first  to directly compare personality evaluations of the self, a close other, and a non-close other in a single study, which allows identification of regions associated with accessing knowledge about the self as compared to either  highly familiar or less familiar individuals that may or may not be similar to you. As was observed in Experiment 1, activation when directly appraising one’s own traits was very similar to that observed when appraising a close friend’s traits. The only prior study comparing activation for self and a close other also found greater activation of right lateral PFC, but not MPFC (Schmitz et al., 2004). At a slightly relaxed threshold ( P < 0.005), we too observed greater activity only in right lateral PFC, in a rostral region which has been associated with the evaluation of self-generated information (Christoff and Gabrieli, 2000). By contrast, prior studies comparing appraisals of self and non-close others have reported greater MPFC activation (e.g., Kelley et al., 2002). We too observed this effect, albeit once again at a slightly relaxed threshold, in MPFC regions somewhat more dorsal to those reported previously but which have been associated with self-referential processing nonetheless (for other studies showing similar foci of activation, see Table 6). The increasing recruitment of dorsal MPFC for judgments of targets more like the self suggests that this region may support high level representation and awareness of cognitive and emotional states that help differentiate self from other (cf. Gusnard et al., 2001; Lane and McRae, in press). This hypothesis is consistent with prior findings showing greater dorsal MPFC activation for judgments of one’s own as compared to a non-close other’s emotional state (Ochsner et al., 2004). The region of right rostral lateral PFC observed in the You About Self > You About Friend contrast was also activated in the You About Self > You About Other contrast, suggesting that it may play a general role in evaluating self-generated information pertaining to one’s disposition (Christoff and Gabrieli, 2000).  K.N.

Experiment 2 is also the first study to contrast direct self appraisals made from a first-person perspective with reflected self appraisals made from a third-person perspective. Direct firstperson appraisals activated the midportion of the posterior cingulate more than reflected appraisals made from either the perspective of a close or a non-close other. Comparison with non-close others also revealed greater insula and inferior parietal activation. These findings are consistent with previous research showing insula and posterior cingulate activation when participants adopt a first-person as compared to third-person visual perspective on a display (Vogeley et al., 2004) and left inferior parietal activation associated with discriminating one’s own actions from those of other people (Decety et al., 2002). Regions more activated for third- as compared to first-person appraisals  of self-included structures associated with retrieval of episodic and semantic information as well as emotion. Thus, reflecting on a close other’s opinions about you (as compared to your own opinions of yourself) activated right orbitofrontal cortex, insula and parahippocampus, which have been associated with the representation and regulation of emotional/motivational states (Beer et al., 2004; Ochsner and Feldman, 2001) and the retrieval of episodic memory (Kahn et al., 2004), respectively. Reflecting a non-close other’s opinions about you activated middle and inferior temporal regions associated with storing semantic and visual memories for people and objects (Mitchell et al., 2002; Paller et al., 2003). These findings are consistent with the idea that when trying to determine what a relatively unfamiliar person might believe about you, one is more likely to rely on memories  806  K.N.

Alternatively, joint activation of structures associated with regulation, affect, and memory could reflect assessments of how much you like the other person, which could inform judgments of how much they like you back, or it could reflect self-enhancing appraisals motivated by the desire to think others view them positively. In this way, self appraisal may  serve an emotion regulatory function, not unlike reappraisal of aversive events, which also involves orbitofrontal and insular regions (Ochsner et al., 2004).  General discussion  The present set of experiments began with the deceptively simple question: how do we know what were like? The results of two experiments converge to offer an interestingly complex answer.  Neural systems supporting direct and reflected self appraisals  2 Response times were longer on trials involving judgments of a non-close other, which means that regions more active for contrasts involving these judgments could reflect either recruitment of processes unique to thinking about non-close others, or it could reflect engagement for a longer period of time of mechanisms also involved in other judgment types. For example, it is possible that the temporal regions identified in the contrasts of Other About You or You About Other blocks > You About Self blocks are also active when reasoning about one’s self, albeit for a shorter duration of time.  On one hand, MPFC activation was observed in both experiments for all judgments involving direct appraisals of self, a close other, or a non-close other, as well as for all judgments involving reflected appraisals of what those others believe about you. Experiment 2 revealed additional activation associated with these judgments in posterior cingulate/precuneus and temporal cortical regions. Differential MPFC activation was observed for direct  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  807  appraisals of self in comparison to non-close others but not in comparison to close others, which is consistent with the idea that similar processes may be used to support inferences about the self and those we perceive to be like us (Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Krueger, 2003). More generally, the established association of MPFC, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and temporal regions with both self-referential and social cognitive judgments of various kinds supports the idea that these regions comprise a network important for reasoning about the states and traits of people (Table 6; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Lieberman and Pfeifer, in press; Ochsner et al., 2004).  the orbitofrontal,  On the other hand,  insular, and temporal regions shown here to support a reflected third-person perspective on the self are different than the parietal and medial prefrontal regions associated in prior studies with imagining the visual perspective available to, or beliefs held by, another person (Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Ruby and Decety, 2003, 2004; Vogeley et al., 2004). One possible reason for this discrepancy has to do with differences in the content of stimuli and the judgments made about them.3 Prior studies involving judging the mental states of others  it  is possible that  3 An additional reason why the present study failed to observe medial prefrontal activation when making reflected as compared to direct appraisal has to do with the general concern that the way in which any given selfreferential judgment is made differs when it is performed alone as compared to being performed in the context of other judgments (a problem common to virtually all studies investigating self-referential judgments). In the present Experiment 1, for example, inclusion of both self referential and normative judgments led participants to engage on every trial the processes normally used to make each type of judgment alone. Thus, a participant might judge how friendly they are while the same time monitoring the extent to which friendliness is a positive trait. Conversely, a participant could judge the extent to which friendliness is a positive trait while monitoring the extent to which they themselves are friendly or would want to be friendly. In this way, the processes supporting a normative judgment, which involves reflecting the beliefs of an average person, can be recruited in combination with the processes supporting a self-referential judgment. It is possible that a similar interaction between, or parallel recruitment of, processes supporting direct and reflected appraisals took place in the context of Experiment 2. In this case, participants could be simultaneously activating processes used to judge what they think about themselves and processes used to reflect upon what their close other or nonclose other might think about them. For example, when rating the extent to which a participant thinks she is friendly, she could be monitoring the extent to which her best friend/relationship partner also thinks she is friendly. Similarly, when rating the extent to which her non-close teaching assistant thinks she is diligent, she could be monitoring the extent to which she considers herself diligent. In this way, every judgment condition could involve a high degree of meta-cognitive monitoring as participants are aware of the extent to which each judgment could be made differently from a different perspective. Representing meta-self-knowledge is one function that has been proposed to explain why MPFC is recruited in self referential, social cognitive, and other types of judgment (Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2005; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). The fact that Experiment 2 used the same set of trait adjectives for all judgment conditions could have created circumstances highly conducive to engaging all of the processes simultaneously. The decision to rotate a single set of adjectives through judgment conditions was intended to model social cognitive behavioral paradigms that allow measurement of the extent to which individuals perceive themselves to be similar to close and non-close others. An unintended consequence of this methodological choice may have been an increased reliance of each judgment type on all three processes, which may have recruited MPFC, and in turn could explain why greater MPFC activation was not observed for reflected appraisals. More broadly, this could have made it less likely to observe differences in MPFC activation across conditions.  have employed visual or conceptual judgment targets that may depend more strongly upon motor imagery and visuomotor integration processes associated with parietal cortex (Decety et al., 2002; Ruby and Decety, 2003, 2004), which could explain the failure to observe parietal activation here. Additionally, these targets may have had little autobiographical and/or emotional relevance in comparison to trait adjectives, which could explain why prior studies have failed to activate regions associated with memory or emotion observed here when participants assessed what beliefs others’ might hold about them.  Psychological processes supporting direct and reflected appraisals  Although the striking similarity between brain regions supporting direct and reflected appraisals is consistent with the idea that related psychological processes support them (Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Krueger, 2003), it is important to consider at least two important questions about this apparent similarity.  The first concerns the fact that there are multiple kinds of reflected appraisals in which a person may engage, each of which may involve different types of psychological processes. For example, the present experiment examined reflected appraisals of the self concept, which likely involved memory retrieval processes, the activation of stored knowledge representations, and/or online inference processes about beliefs and mental states. As described in the preceding and following sections, activation of temporal, cingulate, and medial prefrontal regions may be related to the recruitment of these processes. By contrast, other types of reflected appraisals – such as when one attempts to, , on audience comprehension while delivering an oral presentation – may depend instead (or additionally) upon the online assessment of non-verbal social cues. This ability has been associated with superior and inferior temporal systems different than those identified here (Allison et al., 2000).  F _ get a read  F  _  egocentric  The second question concerns the relevance of the present results to broader debates concerning the way in which we draw inferences about the beliefs, attitudes, and dispositions of other people. Some have argued that the self (i.e., one’s own beliefs, attitudes, etc.) forms the basis of judging others, and that depending upon the context, we may correct for these biases (e.g., Aron et al., 1992; Epley et al., 2004; Krueger, 2003). Others have argued that judgments of others involve the use of abstract person knowledge and/or theories about they way in which individuals behave in general (e.g., Gopnik and Wellman, 1992; Karniol, 2003; Perner et al., 1999). The present study was not designed specifically to discriminate between these alternatives. That being said, greater similarity between patterns of activation for appraisals of self and close as opposed to non-close others is consistent with the idea that others are judged in much the same way as the self (cf. Mitchell et al., 2005). The question of which specific computational processes support is considered in the following section.  this judgment  The role of MPFC in self-reference and social cognition  The increasingly ubiquitous activation of MPFC (and nearby paracingulate cortex) across a variety of tasks ostensibly tapping self-referential, social cognitive, and other types of abilities begs the question of the exact computations carried out in this region (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001).

As can be seen, there is great heterogeneity in the precise coordinates activated across studies. To date, a simple theoretical to emerge for explaining exactly why some tasks activate some regions of MPFC whereas others do not.  framework has yet  _  F intuitive  One suggestion is that like lateral PFC (D’Esposito et al., 2000; Miller and Cohen, 2001), ventral and dorsal regions of MPFC are involved in maintaining different types of representations necessary for task performance. On this view, ventral MPFC (roughly z < 10), which is interconnected with the amygdala and ventral striatum (Ongur et al., 2003; Ongur and Price, 2000), supports the representation of affective and motivational states. These representations may function as feelings about the value of stimuli with respect to current goals and decisions. In contrast, dorsal regions of MPFC (roughly z > 10) that lack these connections may support the re-representation of this information in a symbolic format that is useful for explicitly describing and reasoning about internal states (Lane and McRae, in press; Eisenberger et al. in press; Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2005; Lieberman and Pfeifer, in press; Ochsner et al., 2004). This could explain why in Experiment 2, dorsal MPFC was recruited both when task conditions required reflected appraisals of self and when judgments required direct appraisals of self as compared to a non-close other. It can also explain dorsal MPFC involvement in theory of mind attributions and explicit ratings of current emotional states (Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Ochsner et al., 2004), as compared to ventral MPFC  recruitment for more intuitive forms of self-reference as well as reward-related decision making and conditioned learning (Lieberman et al., 2004; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Ochsner et al., 2004). In this context, it is noteworthy that all judgment types in Experiment 2 activated both dorsal and ventral MPFC in comparison to the perceptual baseline, which may be related to the recruitment of both of these types of processes.4  Is the self  F special  _ ?  Socrates famously admonished his students that they should ‘‘know thyself.’’ The present research suggests that (1) the neural systems (MPFC and rostrolateral PFC) involved in direct appraisals of self and close others may have more in common than those supporting direct appraisals of self and non-close others (Aron et al., 1992; Kenny and DePaulo, 1993), and (2) that direct and reflected  F  _ resting baseline  4 Interestingly, both dorsal and ventral MPFC activity also has been found during so-called conditions in which participants can freely think about whatever they wish as compared to task conditions that require cognitive control of some kind (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001). This has led to the hypothesis that MPFC (along with other regions showing similar resting activity) continuously monitors the internal milieu (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001), and that self-referential and social cognitive judgments required by experimental tasks redirect this default-state processing system (Christoff et al., in press; Iacoboni et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2003). The consistent activation of MPFC for all judgment types relative to the perceptual baseline is consistent with the notion that the monitoring functions ascribed to MPFC may be recruited whenever one engages in self-appraisal.  K.N.

(a) Top and bottom panels show regions of posterior cingulate cortex more active for first-person direct self appraisals as compared to third-person appraisals made from the perspective of a close other/ friend or a non-close other.

Bottom panel shows a temporo-polar regions more active for reflected appraisals made from the third-person perspective of a non-close other as compared to direct self appraisals made from one’s own first-person perspective.  appraisals of self may be thought of as two sides of the same coin, as suggested by the highly overlapping network of brain regions involved in both paths to self-knowledge. More generally, across all judgment conditions, the recruitment of MPFC and other allied regions was more similar than it was different.  types that  It remains to be seen, however, whether this similarity holds types of direct and reflected appraisals and, more for all generally, whether similar neural systems support all types of judgments involving the self and others. A primary goal for future research should be the identification of task parameters and judgment types of computational processes involved in judgments of self and other. This work will need to address the situational (e.g., a social interaction versus a moment of self-reflection) and motivational (e.g., I want to understand my partner’s feelings about me versus I need to choose a gift for him/her) contexts in which we engage each type of appraisal and recruit particular combinations of underlying neural systems.  recruit distinct  Finally, it is important to note that accomplishment of this longterm goal may hinge upon researchers’ ability to creatively and constructively integrate the theories and methods of social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Whereas the former can help specify when, how, and with what consequences particular appraisals are made, the latter can be used to specify which neural systems may be involved. Such an integrative social cognitive neuroscience approach can be used to construct theories of self appraisals that link multiple levels of analysis (Cacioppo, 2002; Klein and Kihlstrom, 1998; Ochsner and Lieberman, 2001).

One of these networks, the so called default mode network, has become the primary target in recent investigations to link intrinsic activity to cognition and how intrinsic signal changes may be altered in disease. In this study we assessed functional connectivity within the default mode network during both rest and a continuous working memory task on a region-by-region basis using partial correlation analysis, a data-driven method that provides insight into effective connectivity within neuronal networks. Prominent features of functional connectivity within the default mode network included an overall strong level of interaction between the precuneus/posterior cingulate region and the rest of the default mode network, as well as a high degree of interaction between the left and right medial temporal lobes combined with weak interactions between the medial temporal lobes and the rest of the default mode network. Additionally, we found support for strong interactions between the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and the left inferior parietal lobe as well as between the dorsal and ventral sections of the medial prefrontal cortex. The suggested pivotal role of the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex in the default mode network is discussed.  © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  Intrinsic functional brain connectivity as revealed by lowfrequency spontaneous signal ﬂuctuations in fMRI signal intensity time-courses has received increased attention in the neuroscience community. A ﬁrst demonstration of the existence of so called resting-state networks was given by Biswal et al. (1995) by showing that brain activity in the primary sensorimotor brain areas are synchronized across the hemispheres during rest. Subsequent functional connectivity studies focusing on the detection of low-frequency fMRI signal changes using explorative, data-driven analysis methods have suggested that there exist up to 10 resting-state networks that span long-range cortico-cortical as well as well as cortical– subcortical networks in the human brain (Beckmann et al., 2005; Damoiseaux et al., 2006). Moreover, recent investigations have presented experimental data suggesting that  ⁎ Corresponding author. Fax: +46 8 5177 3266.  E-mail address: Peter.Fransson@ki.se (P.

From a cognitive neuroscience point of view, particular attention has been paid to one of the resting-state networks, the so called default mode network (DMN, Raichle et al., 2001). There are several reasons for this interest, one being that positron emission tomography (PET) investigations have revealed that the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (pC/ PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), both previously shown to be part of the DMN, show an elevated level of metabolic activity (Raichle et al., 2001). Another reason is the recurrent observation that attention-demanding tasks cause a decrease in activity in the DMN (Shulman et al., 1997; Mazoyer et al., 2001). Finally, studies targeting the neuronal basis for self-related mental tasks have shown consistent signal increases in the DMN compared to tasks without elements of self-related mental processing (see Buckner et al., 2008 for a review). From a clinical perspective, the DMN has become a primary objective in the endeavour to characterize and localize differences in resting-state network activity as biological markers for abnormalities in brain connectivity for  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  1179  a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders. For example, previous studies using seed-based ROI correlation analyses have shown that intrinsic fMRI signal ﬂuctuations in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (pC/PCC) is altered in schizophrenia (Bluhm et al., 2007), while intrinsic functional correlation between the pC/PCC, MPFC and the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) is altered in autism (Kennedy and Courchesne, 2008). Moreover, a recent study has shown a signiﬁcant decrease in intrinsic resting-state functional correlation between the MPFC and the PCC in ADHD subjects compared to healthy controls (Castellanos et al., 2008). Using pairwise correlation measures in the healthy brain, Buckner et al. (2008) have obtained results that suggest that the pC/PCC, MPFC and the bilateral IPL together constitute a “core hub” in the DMN. The regions of this “core hub” showed strong intraregional correlation with each other and weaker correlation with the remaining regions in the DMN such as the temporal cortex (TC) and the medial temporal lobe (MTL).  While substantial information has been gained in terms of the spatial location of brain regions that participate in resting-state networks and how these networks are altered during cognitive work and disease (e.g. see Fox and Raichle, 2007; Buckner et al., 2008), less is known of the functional connectivity within the DMN. Investigations that previously have studied default mode activity have typically relied on voxel-based differences in correlation strength calculated on the basis of reference signal intensity time-courses extracted from seed regions of interest (ROIs) positioned in one or several default mode brain areas. Although this approach has been successfully applied to investigate the putative role of the DMN in both health and disease, it provides little information regarding differences in functional interactions at the level of individual brain areas (or equivalently network nodes) in the DMN. In other words, a pairwise correlation analysis of DMN activity does not take into account the covariance structure of the entire DMN and potentially interesting information is lost. Moreover, all seed-based ROI analysis approaches to connectivity investigations are to some extent vulnerable to user-introduced bias in terms of the choices of seed regions made by the investigator.  The goal of the present work was to investigate functional connectivity within the DMN and at the same time addressing the methodological limitations described above. Functional connectivity within the DMN during both rest and a working memory task was assessed in a two-step procedure. First, estimates of regional fMRI signal intensity time-courses in the DMN were extracted based on information contained in statistical maps created by an independent component analysis. Second, functional connectivity within the DMN was assessed using a partial correlation technique that estimates the level of interaction between any two network nodes after removal of the common inﬂuences from all other nodes. The partial correlation analysis showed that the pC/PCC was the only node that exhibited interactions with virtually all other network nodes. The cognitive implications and uses of the observed patterns of interactions within the DMN are discussed.  Materials and methods  The results presented in this study constitute a re-analysis of dataset that has been described previously (Fransson, 2006) using new analytical tools. We here provide basic information  regarding the participants, task and scanning procedures. For a more detailed account, we refer the reader to Fransson (2006).  Subjects and tasks  Seventeen subjects (5 males, age span 22–41 years) participated in this study. No subject had any history of neurological or psychiatric illness. All MR examinations were carried out according to the ethical guidelines and declarations of the Declaration of Helsinki (1975) and the current study was approved by the local ethics committee at the Karolinska University Hospital. All subjects participated in two 10 min echo-planar imaging (EPI), blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) scanning sessions during which they either performed a resting-state task with their eyes ﬁxating on a hair-cross centred on a white black screen or engaged in a continuous verbal 2-back working memory task.  MR image acquisition  All MRI data was acquired on a General Electric Twin-Speed Signa Horizon 1.5 T MRI scanner. Echo-planar imaging (TR/ TE=2000/40 ms, ﬂip=80°, 64 ×64 matrix size, FOV=220 ×220 mm, 29 slices) was used to detect BOLD fMRI signal changes during rest and the working memory task. 300 echo-planar image volumes were acquired for each task.  Image pre-processing  All  image processing was performed using the SPM2 software package (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK, Friston et al., 1995). As a ﬁrst step, functional image time-series were corrected for head motion by realigning all images to the ﬁrst image volume. Second, the mean EPI image for each subject was co-registered to a corresponding T1-weighted high-resolution image volume and subsequently spatially normalized and re-sampled (3×3×3 mm3 voxels) to the approximate Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) as deﬁned by the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) EPI template in SPM2. As a last step, the normalized echo-planar image volumes were spatially ﬁltered using an isotropic Gaussian ﬁlter (6 mm FWHM).  Selection of regions of interest  Previous studies have consistently shown that the dorsal and ventral parts of the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus/ posterior cingulate cortex, lateral parietal cortex, temporal cortex as well as the medial temporal lobe are involved in the default mode network (Buckner et al., 2008). Hence, for our network analysis of DMN activity we chose to extract fMRI signal intensity time-courses from nine brain regions (network nodes): precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (pC/pCC), left and right inferior parietal lobe (lIPL, rIPL), dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, vmPFC), left and right temporal cortex (lTC, rTC) and left and right medial temporal lobes (lMTL, rMTL). A selection of regional DMN activity was accomplished in a three-step procedure. First, an independent component analysis (ICA) of the resting-state data was performed and 60 spatio-temporal independent components were extracted from each individual dataset  1180  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  using the MELODIC FSL software (MELODIC v4.0; FMRIB Oxford University, UK, Beckmann and Smith, 2004). Second, by matching each independent component with a spatial template of the default mode network based on an independent dataset (Fransson, 2005), the spatially bestﬁtting independent component was extracted for each subject as previously described (Greicius et al., 2004, 2007). Third, local estimates of default mode activity in each network region were identiﬁed in terms of voxels exhibiting local Z-score maximum in the best-ﬁtting independent component. To ensure that only the relevant anatomical structures were included, the search for each local maxima was constrained by using the WFU (Wake Forest University) Pickatlas toolbox (Maldjian et al., 2003) together with the AAL (Automatic Anatomical Labelling) atlas (TzourioMazoyer et al., 2002) within SPM. A table of the AAL atlas structures included in the search for each local maximum is given in Supplementary Table 1. Consequently, the exact spatial location for the ROIs was allowed to vary between individuals, although only within the anatomical boundaries detailed in Supplementary Table 1. Although the anatomical constraints were set to be rather liberal, the possibility that they impose a user-introduced bias in the ROI selection process cannot be fully ruled out. An additional constraint was that the individual regions had to be located at least 15 mm apart. Since the distance between the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex was less than 15 mm in three subjects, the data from these three subjects were discarded and the subsequent partial and marginal correlation analysis was based on the remaining fourteen subjects. A representation of DMN activity during rest in the extracted independent components is shown in Fig. 1. Finally, signal intensity time-courses during both rest and the working memory task were extracted using spherical ROIs with a radius of 6 mm. All signal intensity time-courses were bandpass ﬁltered (passband 0.012–0.1 Hz) and orthogonalized with respect to the global mean brain signal. Thus, in each individual, 9 (network regions/nodes)×2 (conditions: rest and working memory) BOLD signal intensity timecourses were extracted, resulting in two datasets per subject pertaining to default mode network activity in the nine network regions. The spatial variability between subjects in the exact anatomical location of ROIs for the ICA-based ROI selection method is shown in the MNI space in Supplementary Figure 1. A quantitative account of the spatial variability between subjects for the ICA-based ROI locations is given in Supplementary Table 2.  Partial correlation analysis  The aim of the present analysis was to address the structure of functional connectivity on a node-by-node basis within the DMN. Typically, investigations regarding effective connectivity for a given functional network in the brain would be approached by using hypothesis-driven data modelling tools such as structural equation modelling (SEM) or dynamic causal modelling (DCM). Both methods are able to provide estimates of effective connectivity provided that detailed knowledge regarding both the structural and functional characteristics of the network exist and can be incorporated into the model. However, hypothesis-driven modelling methods are not easily applicable in this case since information regarding the functional architecture of resting-state networks driven by intrinsic activity is very scarce. Therefore, we have here chosen to use partial correlation analysis, a purely data-driven analysis approach that requires no a priori information and thereby avoiding potential modelling pitfalls in terms of biasing our model of default mode activity by constraints that have weak experimental and/or theoretical support.  In brief, partial correlation analysis of a network composed of R regions consists of computing the conditional correlation between any pair of two regions with respect to the remaining R-2 regions. Hence, partial correlation analysis allows for the removal of mutual dependencies originating from other brain region's common inﬂuences (Marrelec et al., 2006; 2007; Salvador et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2008). In other words, a partial correlation coefﬁcient reﬂects the level of interaction between two regions once the signals of these two regions have been projected onto the subspace orthogonal to the space spanned by the time-courses of all the other regions in the network. As such, this data-driven approach provides access to a measure of interactivity between any two brain regions in a network of arbitrary size that is closer to effective connectivity than marginal correlations (Marrelec et al., 2006, 2007, 2008).  Partial and marginal correlation coefﬁcients between all nine network nodes in the DMN during rest as well as during the working memory task were computed at a group level using a hierarchical model that takes intra- as well as intersubject variability into account. Statistical inference of interaction between any two network nodes was done in a Bayesian framework where a Gibbs sampling scheme was used to estimate the posterior distribution of the group partial correlation matrix. Both marginal and partial correlation coefﬁcients were thresholded at p b0.05 under the null  Fig. 1.

Activation maps shown in an axial, sagittal and coronal slice orientation show consistent activity in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobe, medial temporal lobe as well as in the lateral temporal cortex.  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  1181  hypothesis that no interaction between pairs of network nodes exists. A detailed mathematical description of the algorithm and its implementation as outlined here is given in Marrelec et al. (2006).  Results  At a group level, intrinsic activity during rest in the DMN was faithfully represented by the extracted independent component analysis as shown in Fig. 1. Pertinent to our network analysis, consistent activity was found in the pC/PCC, bilateral lateral temporal cortex, MTL, inferior parietal cortex and the dorsal as well as the ventral aspects of the MPFC. Our network modelling results are presented in Fig. 2. Connectivity within the DMN during rest and the continuous verbal 2back task is shown using either marginal or partial correlation as a measure of functional connectivity. A detailed account of the magnitudes for the corresponding correlation coefﬁcients for each individual link is shown in Fig. 3.  As expected, marginal correlation coefﬁcients were signiﬁcantly larger than zero for links between all pairs of network nodes in our model of the default mode. That is, every network node was positively correlated with all the other nodes in the DMN during rest (Fig. 2, upper left panel). However, when correlation between any two nodes was conditioned on all other nodes in the DMN, the partial correlation analysis showed that the pC/pCC region is presumably a central node in the DMN since it was the only region to interact directly with all other regions, with the exception of the right MTL which in turn interacted only with the left MTL (Fig. 2, lower left panel). We also noted the strong degree of interactivity between the pC/pCC and the left inferior parietal cortex as well as the dorsal part of the medial prefrontal cortex (Fig. 2, lower left; Fig. 3, bottom graph). Moreover, it is also of interest to note that while the left and right MTL strongly interacted during rest, their degree of interactivity with the rest of the network nodes was weak. Speciﬁcally, the only signiﬁcant interactions between the medial temporal lobes and the rest of the default mode  network were between the left MTL and the pC/pCC and the left temporal cortex, respectively. In addition, there seems to exist a strong interaction between the dorsal and ventral parts of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) that survives a conditioning with respect to the remaining regions of the default mode network. Finally, the continuous verbal 2-back task seemed to cause a global reduction in functional interactivity within the DMN, although the overall functional structure within the DMN was to a large extent preserved (Fig. 2, lower and upper right panel).  Discussion  In this study, we have presented an investigation to gain insights on how intrinsic activity is routed at the level of individual brain regions in the default mode network. The usage of a data-driven analysis approach allowed us to estimate functional connectivity without making any prior assumptions on how intrinsic activity is implemented within the DMN. Importantly, compared to calculating the pairwise (marginal) correlation coefﬁcients for all brain regions in the DMN, the partial correlation approach provided the means to characterize interactions between any two network nodes in terms that are close to effective connectivity, i.e. the degree to which activity in one brain area modulates activity in another area. In this context, the pC/PCC node is particularly noteworthy, since after conditioning it was the only node in the default mode network that directly interacted with virtually all other nodes. We interpret this observation that the pC/PCC may play a pivotal role in how intrinsic activity is mediated throughout the DMN. This interpretation is in harmony with the notion that the pC/PCC is a key region in the neuronal network that sustains a sense of self-consciousness that is engaged in self-referential mental thoughts during rest. The strong interactivity of the pC/PCC as demonstrated here is also in line with previous neuroimaging studies that have implicated the pC/PCC in a range of cognitive tasks that touches upon various aspects of selfprocessing (for recent reviews see Cavanna and Trimble,  Fig. 2. The upper two panels show in a network graph format the marginal, i.e. pairwise correlation coefﬁcients computed for the nine brain regions (network nodes) in the default mode network during rest (upper left panel) and the continuous working memory task (upper right panel). The correlation strength between any two nodes is colour-coded according to the colour-bar on the right side of the ﬁgure. The lower two panels show the degree of functional interactivity, i.e. the partial correlation coefﬁcients for the nine nodes during both rest (lower left panel) and the working memory task (lower right panel). Only network links that were signiﬁcantly larger than zero (p b0.05) are shown. All network connectivity shown here is based on an independent component analysis approach to extract local changes in intrinsic activity in each network node and subject.  1182  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  Fig. 3. The upper graph shows the magnitude of the marginal correlation coefﬁcients for all 36 links in the nine node model of intrinsic activity in the default mode network. The lower plot shows the magnitude of the corresponding partial correlation coefﬁcients within the default mode network. The coefﬁcients obtained for rest are marked in blue while the corresponding coefﬁcients for the continuous working memory task are marked in red. Similar to the data presented in Fig. 2, all coefﬁcients shown here are computed on signal intensity time-courses extracted by an independent component analysis approach to ﬁnd subject speciﬁc local maxima of intrinsic activity in each network node.  2006; Buckner and Carroll, 2007). Additionally, a pivotal status of the pC/PCC node is also justiﬁed from a metabolic and mechanistic perspective in that previous PET studies have shown that the metabolic activity is higher in the pC/ PCC than all other regions during rest (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001). Moreover, a previous resting-state fMRI study that employed a model including a cosine basis set spanning the frequency interval of interest together with an F-test that tested for the presence of low-frequency signal ﬂuctuations showed a particular strong presence of spontaneous signal changes in pC/PCC and to a somewhat lesser degree in the MPFC and left lateral parietal cortex than in any other region in the DMN (see Fransson, 2005, Fig 3. p. 20). Pertinent to this ﬁnding is also the fact that previous PET studies have shown a reduction in brain metabolism in the pC/PCC in the earliest clinical and pre-clinical phases of Alzheimer's disease (Minoshima et al., 1997). Moreover, recent resting-state fMRI studies of DMN activity in patients diagnosed to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease have revealed regionally speciﬁc reductions in coherence of low-frequency signal ﬂuctuations in the precuneus (He et al., 2007). Additionally, a recent fMRI study has demonstrated reduced functional connectivity between the precuneus/PCC and the MTL in patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment, a  syndrome of high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (Sorg et al., 2007).  The strong interaction between the dorsal and ventral parts of the MPFC during both rest and working memory was preserved in the partial correlation analysis. This ﬁnding is perhaps not overly surprising since the functional border between the two is not clear-cut from an intrinsic activity perspective. Although local maxima of intrinsic activity located speciﬁcally in either part have been reported (Greicius et al., 2003; Fransson, 2005; Fox et al., 2005), intrinsic activity in the MPFC is often observed as a contiguous cluster of activity that spans the MPFC along its entire dorsal–ventral extension (Fransson, 2005; Fox et al., 2005). This observation is also reﬂected by the fact that the data from 3 subjects were discarded from the network analysis due to a close proximity (less than 15 mm) of local maxima in resting-state activity in the dorsal and ventral MPFC. Similarly, the strong interaction across hemispheres for the MTLs during both rest and the working memory task is noteworthy. This ﬁnding together with the observation that the interaction between the bilateral MTLs and the remaining DMN were rather weak suggests that intrinsic activity in the medial temporal lobes operates, at least in part, independently from the rest of the DMN. It should also be mentioned that this view on the role of  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  1183  the MTL in the default mode network is not in conﬂict with a previously published study on the MTL and intrinsic activity since pairwise marginal correlation was used as a measure of functional connectivity in that study (Vincent et al., 2006). Additionally, the partial correlation analysis suggests a tendency for slightly stronger interactions in the left compared to the right hemisphere. For example, the left temporal cortex was the only region to interact with the MTL and the left inferior parietal lobe region was signiﬁcantly interactive with both the dorsal and ventral parts of the MPFC.  The overall preserved structure of functional interactivity during the working memory task (Fig. 2 upper and lower right panels) is in agreement with previous seed-based ROI marginal correlation analyses (Fransson, 2006). The persistence of intrinsic activity in the DMN during a continuous verbal 2-back working memory task, a task that provides very little time to conscious, non-task related self-referential thinking, further supports the idea that intrinsic activity in the DMN is not caused exclusively by spontaneous changes in conscious thought. This line of reasoning is further reinforced by recent studies that have shown that DMN activity is preserved during early stages of sleep (Fukunaga et al., 2006; Horovitz et al., 2008) as well as during anaesthesia (Vincent et al., 2007). Pertinent to our results, it is interesting to note that a recent study observed a speciﬁc effect in terms of reduced intrinsic activity in the pC/PCC region during conscious sedation by means of administration of midazolam (Greicius et al., in press). The hypothesis that behaviour contributes to spontaneous activity in resting-state networks was recently addressed in a recent study by Fox et al. that observed a correlation between button press force and spontaneous trialto-trial variability in the left somatomotor cortex (Fox et al., 2007). Although the neuronal mechanism that causes spontaneous low-frequency signal changes is currently unknown, we interpret the experimental data and results presented so far that conscious as well as unconscious neuronal processes may contribute to intrinsic brain activity (see also Fransson, 2006).  One of the previously proposed functional roles of the DMN is that it supports an ability to perform internal mentation in the sense that the DMN provides a platform for putting together dynamic mental scenarios that are largely detached from the external world (Buckner and Carroll, 2007). Typically, these scenarios would contain elements of auto-biographical episodic memory, self-related prospective thoughts, moral judgments as well as evaluations of other persons' intentions (theory-of-mind). Further, it has been suggested that the purpose for a continuously on-going internal mentation process is to act as a simulator and predictor of future events that builds upon previous experiences. With this hypothesis in mind, it has been noted that previous task-driven neuroimaging studies support the idea that the default mode network can be divided into two subsystems (Buckner et al., 2008). On one hand, previous studies have shown that the posterior part of the DMN including the pC/PCC, bilateral IPL and the MTL region are activated in episodic memory retrieval (e.g. Wagner et al., 2005). Moreover, it has recently been shown that this subsystem is synchronized through spontaneous signal changes (Vincent et al., 2006). On the other hand, tasks that involve self-referential mental thoughts typically activate the anterior part of the DMN and the pC/PCC (Gusnard et al., 2001). Since the process of simulating future events to a large extent engages the same neuronal circuits as remembering  past events (e.g. see recent review by Schacter et al., 2008), it is plausible to assume that a neuronal platform for internal mentation as described above would require an interaction between the two subsystems (Buckner et al., 2008). Then, the strong interconnectivity between the pC/PCC node and the rest of the DMN as revealed by the partial correlation network analysis adds further support for the hypothesis that the pC/ PCC node in the DMN acts as a convergence node where information processing in the two subsystems is integrated. It could be argued that a more ﬁne-grained model of DMN activity is warranted and that the nine network nodes selected here are unnecessarily limited in scope. For example, it is plausible that the parahippocampal gyrus and the hippocampus may serve different functions within the DMN and thus should be represented as separate network nodes. To address this concern, we initially tried to locate separate maxima of intrinsic activity by performing individual searches in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus as anatomically delineated in the AAL atlas. However, in the majority of subjects, the distance between local maxima in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus was less than 12 mm, which would make an interpretation of separate contributions for these regions in relation to functional interactivity dubious. Since our results suggests the ICA-based approach is less biased while at the same time providing good sensitivity to local changes in intrinsic activity, we here refrained from further reﬁnements of our network model. A separation of parahippocampal versus hippocampus intrinsic activity would most likely require a considerably higher spatial resolution in the raw functional MR images than used here. It should also be stressed that while partial correlation analysis provides estimates of functional interactions it does not give information regarding causality (Marrelec et al., 2006).  In sum, using a novel approach to extract local changes in intrinsic activity combined with a data-driven analysis approach, we have presented a ﬁrst assessment of functional connectivity on a node-by-node basis within the DMN. A prominent ﬁnding included a putative pivotal role for the pC/ PCC in the default mode network. In this context, changes in intrinsic brain activity speciﬁc to developmental (Fransson et al., 2007; Fair et al., 2008), aging (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2007; Damoiseaux et al., 2007) as well as disease-related mechanisms (e.g. Garrity et al., 2007; Castellanos et al., 2008) have recently been reported (for recent reviews see Buckner et al., 2008 and Fox and Raichle, 2007). We suggest that the results presented here can serve as a template for informed modelling approaches in a network framework to map and characterize changes in DMN intrinsic activity in both health and disease.

However, it is so far inconclusive whether brain regions known to represent reward values are involved in the generation of optimistically biased belief updates. To address this question, we investigated neural correlates of belief updates that result in relatively better future outlooks, and therefore imply a positive subjective value of the judgment outcome. Participants estimated the probability of experiencing different adverse future events. After being provided with population base rates of these events, they had the opportunity to update their initial estimates. Participants made judgments concerning themselves or a similar other, and were confronted with desirable or undesirable base rates (i.e., lower or higher than their initial estimates). Belief updates were smaller following undesirable than desirable information, and this optimism bias was stronger for judgments regarding oneself than others. During updating, the positive value of self-related updates was reﬂected by neural activity in the subgenual ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that increased both with increasing sizes of favorable updates, and with decreasing sizes of unfavorable updates. During the processing of self-related undesirable base rates, increasing activity in a network including the dorsomedial PFC, hippocampus, thalamus and ventral striatum predicted decreasing update sizes. Thus, key regions of the neural reward circuitry contributed to the generation of optimistically biased selfreferential belief updates. While the vmPFC tracked subjective values of belief updates, a network including the ventral striatum was involved in neglecting information calling for unfavorable updates.  © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  Thinking about the future is part of a person's identity and supports action planning, decision-making and emotion regulation (Carver and Scheier, 2014; D'Argembeau et al., 2012, 2009). However, this highly inﬂuential prospective thinking does not provide us with the most realistic future outlook, but is instead prevalently optimistically biased. Cross-culturally and independent of gender and age, people tend to overestimate the likelihood of positive future outcomes, and to underestimate the likelihood of negative ones in various domains of daily life, including health-related issues, social relations, and professional success (Chowdhury et al., 2014; Leary, 2007; Sharot et al., 2012, 2011; Shepperd et al., 2002, 2013; Weinstein and Klein, 1996). The  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research, Gleulerstr.  50, 50931 Cologne, Germany. Fax: +49 221 4725 344.  E-mail address: bojana.kuzmanovic@sf.mpg.de (B. Kuzmanovic).  consequences of optimistically distorted judgments can be positive or negative: Overestimated chances of success may lead to positive feelings and an increase of effort with beneﬁcial effects for the individual and its environment, but may also lead to miscalculations and failures.  It has been assumed that both motivational and cognitive factors contribute to the optimistic bias, and this reciprocal inﬂuence has also been more generally described as “motivated cognition” (Hughes and Zaki, 2015). Cognitive explanations focus on how people achieve desired end states of judgments, and refer to selective memory search and conclusions that are biased toward retrieving conﬁrmatory information for rewarding beliefs (Shepperd et al., 2002). Motivational explanations, on the other hand, relate to the pleasure of having favorable beliefs regarding oneself and one's own future, and the resulting desire to adopt such optimistic beliefs (Shepperd et al., 2002). Accordingly, optimism bias has been described as “a motivation to adopt the most rewarding (or least aversive) perspective on future outcomes” (Sharot et al., 2011).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.02.014 1053-8119/© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  152  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  However, a previous neuroimaging research on optimism bias reported solely the recruitment of brain regions related to complex cognitive processing, i.e., the inferior and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Sharot et al., 2011). Thus, there is still a lack of evidence for the motivational explanations, which would require a demonstration of recruitment of key structures of the neural reward circuit. While this complex network includes several cortical and subcortical regions, the most prominent structures involved in human value processing are the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the ventral striatum (vStr) (Bartra et al., 2013; Clithero and Rangel, 2014; Haber and Knutson, 2010; Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Peters and Buchel, 2010). The vmPFC, and particularly its subgenual part, has robustly been shown to play a critical role in representing the positive subjective value of rewards and emotional stimuli (Chase et al., 2015; Levy and Glimcher, 2012). While the vStr has traditionally been related to learning from errors in reward prediction, more recent research supports an integrative view involving both learning and motivational functions (Bartra et al., 2013; Hamid et al., 2016). More speciﬁcally, dopaminergic signaling in vStr has been shown to represent values of estimated future rewards, which inﬂuence decisions whether to invest effort in actions aiming at these reward states (Hamid et al., 2016).  The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that favorable beliefs recruit the same brain regions known to be associated with external rewards, to support the view that they have internal positive subjective values able to guide judgment and decision processes. We employed a revised version of an fMRI belief update paradigm. The paradigm assesses how people update their initial beliefs about risks of experiencing hazards when they are provided with base rates for these hazards that result in estimation errors (i.e., the difference between the subject's ﬁrst risk estimation and the presented base rates). It could be shown that updating was optimistically biased because it was larger after desirable new information (lower risk than initially expected) than after undesirable information (higher risk than initially expected) (Sharot et al., 2011). These results contradict formal learning principles as these predict balanced updating in response to errors, independent of the desirability of the new information.  The ﬁrst revision was to extend the study design in order to differentiate between judgments referring to oneself and others. Second, in order to increase the experimental control and precision, we systematically manipulated the presented base rates, and included both the ﬁrst and the second estimations (before and after the presentation of the base rate) in one single trial. And third, we modiﬁed the analyses to allow the identiﬁcation of neural regions that track ﬂuctuations of updates on a trial-by-trial level (in contrast to tracking estimation errors as in Sharot et al., 2011), because belief updates represent the end state of the judgment process and are expected to have a speciﬁc subjective value for judging persons.  We hypothesized that the vmPFC would reﬂect the differential subjective value of varying update sizes that result in better or worse future outlooks relative to participants' initial beliefs, particularly for self-referential judgments. The larger an update toward an unexpectedly low average risk, the better is the subject's adjusted future outlook. Thus, increasing updates after favorable new information are expected to have increasing positive value and to be accompanied by an increasing vmPFC activity. In contrast, the greater an update toward an unexpectedly high average risk, the worse is the updated subject's future outlook, so that decreasing updates in this condition are expected to result in an increasing positive value and increasing vmPFC activity.  Furthermore, we explored in which brain regions the activity during the reception of the new information (base rates) predicted subsequent updates. The belief reconstruction initiated at this point may encompass cognitive processes such as memory retrieval or inferences, but may also be modulated by the motivation to adopt the most favorable conclusions (Shepperd et al., 2002), particularly when these are selfrelevant and unfavorable (Sharot et al., 2011). Finally, we explored the  relationships between the optimism bias in belief updating and trait optimism.  Material and methods  Participants  A total of 36 right-handed individuals with no reported history of neurological or psychiatric illness were recruited online within the Research Center Juelich, Germany, and participated in the fMRI study. Twelve persons were excluded from the analyses. Five persons had excessive head movements (outliers were selected by total movement greater than 3 mm or scan-to-scan motion greater than 1.5 mm, as assessed by ArtRepair Software; Mazaika et al., 2005), probably due to a relatively tight head coil used in the study; the logﬁles of one person were overwritten; one person suspected that the base rates were not correct; two persons had insufﬁcient German language skills as they did not know the meaning of a high number of stimulus events (18 and 24 events). The remaining three persons had a mean positive estimation error of less than 7, because of the frequent low ﬁst estimates (see S.1). Thus, data from 24 participants were included in the analyses (mean age = 25.13 years, SD = 3.89, ranging from 19 to 38; 13 females). All the participants were naïve with respect to the speciﬁc purpose of the study, gave written informed consent and were paid for their participation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne, Germany.  Stimulus material  We used 88 short German descriptions of adverse life events as stimuli and included a wide range of events relating to different life domains (e.g., dementia, arthritis, unemployment, or pest infestation in the home; see Kuzmanovic et al., 2015 for the complete list). The assignment of the stimuli to the experimental conditions and the order of trials were randomized anew for each participant. Note that by applying a random assignment of the stimuli to the experimental conditions, event characteristics that have been suggested to modulate the optimism bias (e.g., base rate, event valence, arousal, controllability, personal experience) (Rose et al., 2008; Sharot et al., 2007; Weinstein, 1980, 1987), or general stimulus characteristics (e.g., number of words or letters) were equally distributed across the experimental conditions, and thus do not constitute confounding variables (see also Kuzmanovic et al., 2015).  Design and procedure  In each trial of the update experiment, the participants ﬁrst had to estimate the probability that different adverse events would occur at least once in a lifetime. Next, they were presented with a corresponding base rate for the general population, and were then given the opportunity to adjust their initial estimate (see Fig. 1 for illustration and durations of events). The intervals within the trial (“jitter 4 s” in Fig. 1) and between the trials randomly varied, resulting in mean durations of 4000 ms and 6000 ms, respectively (within-trial durations varied between 2875 ms and 5125 ms, between-trial durations between 4875 ms and 7125 ms). The successive arrangement of i) the ﬁrst estimation, ii) the presentation of the base rate and iii) the second estimation (including the display of the initial estimate) within one trial represent a substantial modiﬁcation of the original paradigm (Sharot et al., 2011) and served the purpose of minimizing confounding memory effects.  The factors that were expected to affect the update behavior within the task were the target person of the judgment (self, other), the valence of the new information (positive, negative), and the participants' trait optimism scoring (high, low). In contrast to the original paradigm that included self-related judgments only (Sharot et al.,  B.

Example trials of the update experiment. At the beginning of each trial the target person of the judgment was indicated, i.e., self or other. Next, an adverse event was displayed and the participants had to estimate the probability of experiencing it at least once in their (or other's) lifetime. Then, the base rate of the respective event in the general population was presented. Finally, the participants had the opportunity to update their initial estimate. Unbeknown to the participants, the valence of the presented base rate was experimentally manipulated by subtracting or adding varying values from the participants' ﬁrst estimate. Upper row: An example of a desirable (i.e., positive) base rate that was generated by subtracting 10 from the ﬁrst estimate given. Lower row: An equivalent example of an undesirable (i.e., negative) base rate that was generated by adding 10 to the ﬁrst estimate given. The exact time course of the trials is shown at the bottom.  2011), the target person to whom the probabilities had to be ascribed was manipulated by instructing the participants to make estimations for themselves in half of the trials (self), or for a similar other person of the same age, sex and socioeconomic background in the other half of the trials (other). The valence of the new information referring to the base rates of adverse events depended on the participants' initial rating in each trial: When the base rate for an adverse event was lower than the participants' ﬁrst estimate, then this constituted desirable or positive (p) information; when it was higher than the ﬁrst estimate, then this constituted undesirable or negative (n) information. The participants' trait optimism was measured by the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R, Glaesmer et al., 2008). The LOT-R median of the whole sample was used to generate two subsamples (median = 17; see Table 2): low trait optimism (low_to, n = 13) and high trait optimism subsample (high_to, n = 11). Thus, a 2 × 2 × 2 design was realized with the factors target (self vs. other) and valence (p vs. n), resulting in four withinsubject conditions self_p, self_n, other_p and other_n, and the between-subject factor group (low_to vs. high_to).  The participants were told that the experiment aims to investigate the neural substrates of expectations toward future life events. They were instructed that there was no right or wrong answer as we were interested in their subjective judgment, and to feel free to update their ﬁrst estimate as much as they wanted. They were also informed that the population base rates were determined by the German Federal Statistical Ofﬁce (“Statistisches Bundesamt”), and that they should consider this information during their second estimation.  Unbeknown to the participants, the base rates were in fact systematically manipulated in order to control for frequencies and distributions of positive and negative trials, which was the third modiﬁcation of the original paradigm (Sharot et al., 2011). The positive and negative base rates were computed by subtracting or adding varying values from the ﬁrst estimate (ranging from 1 to 25; see Fig. 1 for an example; see S.1 for more details). In a ﬁnal debrieﬁng, the participants were informed that they had been deceived about the source of population base rates, and the methodological reasons for this procedure were explained.  In addition, the participants were instructed to abstain from responding to events for which they felt unable to make a proper estimation. For instance, this could apply to events that the participants were experiencing at the time of participation (e.g., currently suffering  from hay fever), or that they had never heard about (e.g., unfamiliar diseases).  The responses were given by selecting an absolute probability number with a possible range from 1% to 99% in a completely continuous manner by using three response buttons. The participants always used both hands, in one session the right hand for selecting the percentage number and the left hand for conﬁrming it, and in the other session the other way around (order counter-balanced across participants). The number currently displayed on the screen could be decreased by pressing the left button (e.g., index ﬁnger of the right hand), and increased by pressing the right button (e.g., middle ﬁnger of the right hand). As soon as the desired number appeared, the participants could give a ﬁnal conﬁrmation of their response by pressing the conﬁrmation button (little ﬁnger of the other hand). For all ﬁrst estimations, the number initially displayed was 50%, and for all second estimations the number corresponded to the selected ﬁrst estimate (see Fig. 1). The participants were instructed to answer within 6 s. If the answer was not recorded within this time, a second and last response period of 6 s was presented. In the event that the ﬁrst estimate was not provided, the rest of the trial was omitted. The mean durations of the two task sessions were 22.46 min (SD = 1.43) and 21.83 min (SD = 1.16), respectively.  After the fMRI acquisition, the participants completed a short debrieﬁng including ratings of task difﬁculty, and had the opportunity to describe problems or hypotheses regarding the purpose of the task. Importantly, because we manipulated the base rates, we took great care to assess the participants' suspicions regarding their plausibility by using the funnel debrieﬁng method (for more details see Kuzmanovic et al., 2015). Furthermore, they rated their personal experience for each stimulus event that they had seen in the update experiment on a 7-point scale (from 1 = unfamiliar to 7 = currently experiencing). The personal experience ratings were carried out on a laptop with the software Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Version 15.1). Prior to both the update experiment and the personal experience ratings, the participants underwent a standardized, computerized instruction including practice trials with stimuli not used within the experimental tasks. Finally, self-report questionnaires (German versions) were completed to measure relevant characteristics of the sample: LOT-R assessing trait optimism on a scale from 0 (pessimistic) to 24 (optimistic), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck and Steer, 1987)  154  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  assessing symptoms of depression on a scale from 0 (minimal) to 63 (maximal).  The MRI data were acquired by using a Magnetom Trio 3T whole body scanner and a 32-channel head coil (Siemens AG, Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). fMRI data during the update experiment were acquired in two sessions with a T2*-weighted gradient echo planar imaging sequence [TR = 2200 ms, TE = 30 ms, ﬁeld of view = 210 × 210 mm2, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm3, 33 oblique (maximal 30°) axial slices]. Three additional volumes were collected and discarded at the beginning of each session to allow for magnetic saturation. In addition, we acquired high-resolution T1- weighted MPRAGE images (TR = 2250 ms, TE = 3.93 ms, ﬁeld of view = 256 × 256 mm2, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3, 128 sagittal images), as well as DTI images (related analyses not reported here). Stimuli and response displays were presented and recorded by the software package Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Version 15.1), and projected onto a screen at the end of the magnet bore that the participants viewed via a mirror mounted on the head coil. The responses were assessed using an MR-compatible LUMItouch keypad (Photon Control Inc., Burnaby, BC, Canada).  Measures  The critical measure of the participants' behavior was the size of updates after being confronted with the base rates of future life events. For each participant, the difference between the ﬁrst and the second estimate was computed in each of the 88 trials, and then the mean updates were computed separately for each of the four experimental conditions (self_p, self_n, other_p and other_n) by averaging all trialbased updates within each condition. Thus, every participant ended up with four repeated-measures of mean updates. If present, trials with missing responses (M = 1.38, SD = 2.00) and trials with estimation error of zero (M = 3.38, SD = 4.20; e.g., when the participant's ﬁrst estimate was 1%, no errors can be generated to provide desirable base rates, i.e., rates lower than the ﬁrst estimate; see S.1 for more details) were excluded before computing the mean updates. We used signed update values, but with a differential procedure for lower (positive) and higher (negative) base rates. In conditions self_p and other_p, updates in each trial were computed as ﬁrst estimate minus second estimate, because the presented base rate was lower than the ﬁrst estimate and second estimates were expected to be adjusted to this smaller value. Conversely, in conditions self_n and other_n, updates were computed as second estimate minus ﬁrst estimate. Thus, in the majority of trials independent of condition, updates were equal to or greater than zero (see also Table 1 and Fig. 2 for mean values; mean number of zero updates = 20.29, SD = 10.34). For trials in which the participants responded in an unexpected direction (e.g., ﬁrst estimate = 20%, base rate = 10%, second estimate = 25%), the update was a negative value (M = 1.63, SD = 1.69).  Additionally, in order to obtain inter-individual measures of the optimism bias, we computed the difference between the mean update for positive and negative trials, separately for self and other, for each participant. The self-speciﬁc optimism bias (biasself) was computed as mean updateself_p − mean updateself_n, and the other-related optimism bias (biasother) was computed as mean updateother_p − mean updateother_n. Positive values indicate an optimism bias as they result from larger mean updates after desirable than undesirable new information. Finally, a differential optimism bias (biasself_other) was computed as biasself − biasother. Here, a positive value indicates a greater self-related than other-related optimism bias. In addition, we computed the difference between the mean ﬁrst estimates (1stE) relating to self and other (1stEself_other): mean 1stEself − mean 1stEother. The difference in initial risk estimates for adverse future events represents a classical measure for the ‘comparative optimism’ beyond update paradigms (Shepperd et al., 2002). These bias measures, biasself, biasother,  Table 1 Effects of target person and valence of new information on update behavior in the overall sample and in the sub-samples with low and high trait optimism.

Statistical analyses  Behavioral data  All behavioral analyses were conducted by using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 2.0). In order to test for an optimism bias in belief updating under consideration of the participants' trait optimism, we conducted a mixed ANOVA with two within-subject factors target (self vs. other) and valence (positive vs. negative), one between-subject factor trait optimism (low_to vs. high_to), and the dependent variable mean update (general linear model, repeated-measure design). In addition, in order to better characterize the effect of trait optimism, two repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted with target and valence as within-subject factors, separately for the two groups of participants with low and high trait optimism, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient, r, was used as an effect size measure (all F-values had 1 degree of freedom).  In order to test for relationships between the individual measures of the optimism bias (biasself, biasother, biasself_other, 1stEself_other), trait optimism (LOT-R) and depression symptoms (BDI), Pearson's correlation coefﬁcients (r) were calculated. We expected that biasself, biasself_other and 1stEself_other would relate positively to each other and to LOT-R, and negatively to BDI corresponding to reduced optimism in depression (Korn et al., 2014; Scheier et al., 1994; Strunk and Adler, 2009; Strunk et al., 2006), thus one-tailed tests were applied. We did not have any hypotheses about the relationship between biasother and these scores, so we applied two-tailed tests here. The alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests.  B.

Behavioral results of the belief update experiment.

Error bars show 95% CI * p b .05.  fMRI data  The fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using MATLAB 7.9 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) and statistical parametric mapping software package (SPM8, Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK). The EPI images were corrected for head movements using realignment and unwarping, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute reference space using the uniﬁed segmentation function, resampled to 2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm voxels, and spatially smoothed with an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Two separate analyses were conducted: i) a linear parametric modulation of the neural activity during the 2nd estimation by update, and, ii) a linear parametric modulation of the neural activity during the presentation of base rates by update (see S.6 for an illustration and more details). The ﬁrst analysis aimed to identify brain regions where the activity during belief updating correlated with the size of the update, and the second analysis explored whether there were brain regions, in which the activity during the confrontation with disconﬁrming new information correlated with – and thus predicted – subsequent update sizes. At the single-subject level, the conditions were modeled using a boxcar reference vector convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and its time derivative. Events relating to ﬁrst estimation (duration 3 s, including target instruction), base rates (duration 2 s) and second estimation (duration 2 s) were separately modeled for the different experimental conditions (see Fig. 1 and Fig. S.1). Button presses indicating the ﬁrst and the second estimate were modeled on separate regressors (duration from the onset of the response event to the last button press). Trials with missing responses, and trials with estimation error of zero, if present, were modeled on a separate regressor. Movement parameters were included as multiple regressors of no interest. Low-frequency signal drifts were ﬁltered using a cutoff of 128 s. Fourteen contrast images were computed relative to the implicit baseline (i.e., weighting a single regressor of interest with 1 in both sessions and the rest of regressors with 0) and used for grouplevel models: 1st estimation: self and other; base rate: self_p, self_n, other_p, and other_n; 2nd estimation: self_p, self_p_PM (PM, parametric modulation by update) self_n, self_n_PM, other_p, other_p_PM, other_n, and other_n_PM. In the second analysis applying PM to the average BOLD response to base rates, PM-contrasts referred to base rate presentations and not to 2nd estimations (see Fig. S.1).  At the group level, for each of two abovementioned analyses, a ﬂexible factorial design with factors ‘condition’ and ‘subject’ was conducted. The threshold for signiﬁcance was set to p b .05, familywise error (FWE) — corrected at the voxel level for the whole brain with an extent threshold of 10 voxels. Because the main interest concerned neural correlates of varying update sizes, we report all signiﬁcant results relating to whole brain parametric modulation effects from both analyses. In order to explore whether there are differences in the BOLD response pattern between the low_to and the high_to  participants, beta values were extracted for all signiﬁcant cluster maxima and compared between the subsamples using a t-test (p b .05, not corrected for multiple comparisons). For completeness, we also report whole brain main effects relating to average BOLD responses, i.e., independent of parametric modulation by update (see S.7). Furthermore, we also report and brieﬂy discuss the behavioral and neural results relating to estimation errors (see S.4, S.8, S.10). Activations were displayed on sections of the mean normalized T1 image of the overall sample. Anatomical labels were assigned using the Anatomy toolbox (Amunts et al., 2007; Eickhoff et al., 2005).  Results  Behavioral data  Differential updating dependent on target, valence and trait optimism  The behavioral results of the mixed ANOVA show that there was a signiﬁcant interaction between target and valence: The participants updated less in response to undesirable than to desirable base rates, and this effect was stronger for self-related than for other-related judgments (see Table 1 and Fig. 2A). However, there was a signiﬁcant three-way interaction indicating that the groups with low and high trait optimism demonstrated different update behavior patterns. The additional two ANOVAs (separately conducted for the low_to and high_to subsamples) revealed that the target × valence interaction was signiﬁcant only in the high_to group, but not in the low_to group (see Table 1 and Fig. 2B). Thus, only the group with high trait optimism showed a signiﬁcant self-speciﬁc optimism bias. The pattern of the update behavior in the high_to group can also be described as a selectively decreased update behavior during self_n (self_n vs. self_p see Table 1; ps b .01 for self_n vs. other_p and self_n vs. other_n), relative to all other conditions with a comparably high update level (all ps N .05 for self_p vs. other_p, self_p vs. other_n, and other_p vs. other_n).  The reported ANOVA results could be replicated when using update values standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 within each subject taking into account inter-individual differences in the mean tendency to update initial estimates (group × target × valence interaction: p = .001; see S.4 for more details). In addition, conﬁrming the differential updating pattern between subsamples scoring high and low on trait optimism, an ANCOVA based on the overall sample and including target person and valence as within-subject factors and LOT-R scores as a covariate revealed a signiﬁcant three-way interaction target × valence × LOT-R, F(1,22) = 5.75, p = .025.  Other task-related variables, including ﬁrst and second estimates, base rates and estimation errors differed signiﬁcantly across the four conditions [Fs(3,69) N 16, ps b .001], which was partly forced by the experimental design (for descriptive statistics and detailed explanations see S.3 and S.1). For instance, it is to be expected that base rates in the  156  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  positive condition are lower than in the negative condition because they were generated by subtracting values from the participants' ﬁrst estimates, while negative base rates were computed by adding values to the ﬁrst estimates. Importantly, however, none of these variables had a signiﬁcant relationship to update sizes (ﬁrst estimate, r = .12, p = .229; second estimate, r = −.01, p = .998; base rate, r = −.19, p = .066; estimation error, r = −.15, p = .159; not corrected for multiple comparisons), and the ANOVA effects of target person, valence and trait optimism on update remained signiﬁcant even after controlling for these variables (ps b .05; see S.5 for more details).  Relationships between bias measures and questionnaire scores  The individual bias values as well as the trait optimism and BDI scores are presented in Table 2. The correlation analysis revealed that both biasself and biasself_other were positively related to trait optimism (biasself: r = .35, p = .046; biasself_other: r = .46, p = .013), and inversely related to depression symptoms (biasself: r = −.42, p = .020; biasself_other: r = −.50, p = .007). There was no signiﬁcant correlation between biasother and trait optimism (r = −.15, p = .475) or depression symptoms (r = .12, p = .574). In addition, 1stEself_other did not correlate with trait optimism (r = .03, p = .447), depression symptoms (r = −.04, p = .436), nor biasother (r = .10, p = .656). However, there was a correlation between 1stEself_other and biasself (r = −.36, p = .042), and 1stEself_other and biasself_other (r = −.42, p = .021). Furthermore, there was a strong inverse correlation between the trait optimism and depression symptoms (r = −.67, p = .000).  Post-experimental assessments  The analysis of the ratings of personal experience with stimulus events revealed that the stimulus events were equally familiar within the four experimental conditions [F(3,69) = 1.76, p = .163; overall: M = 3.00, SD = 0.36], and that the participants indeed followed the instruction not to respond to events that they were experiencing at the time of the experiment. The examination of the short postexperiment debrieﬁng revealed that the task was not too difﬁcult, and that none of the participants who were included in the analyses were aware of the task purpose, namely, investigating the optimism bias as indicated by larger updates after desirable than after undesirable new information, in particular for self-related judgments. The participants reported that some base rates appeared surprisingly low or high, but that they attributed this to the fact that the probabilities related to the whole population and to the entire lifetime. None of the participants included in the analyses doubted the authenticity of the base rates. In fact, even after being informed about the task purpose and the manipulation of the base rates at the end of the experiment, none of the included participants declared that they were aware of either of these.  fMRI data  fMRI analyses aimed to identify brain regions in which the activity correlated with the size of updates on a trial-by-trial level, i.e., targeting within-subject effects. For the complete list of results relating to the parametric modulation by updates see Table 3.  Neural correlates of updates during second estimation  There was a signiﬁcant difference between regression slopes for self_p and self_n in the vmPFC. The beta estimates in Fig. 3 show that the correlation was positive for self_p, but negative for self_n. That means that when making self-referential judgments, the activity in the vmPFC was greater the larger the desirable updates, and it was also greater the smaller the undesirable updates. This effect also remained signiﬁcant when conducting a paired t-test at the second level of analysis directly comparing the parametric regressors relating to self_p and self_n, respectively (T = 4.33, puncorr = .001, peak at 0/ 34/−14, cluster size 36), however at a less stringent signiﬁcance threshold. In addition, when repeating the same analysis, but with within-subject standardized update values instead of row update values, the self_p N self_n effect in the vmPFC was replicated (T = 5.51, pFWE-corr = .003, peak at −2/36/−10, cluster size 50).  No comparable effect was present for other-related judgments (other_p N other_n). Moreover, the interaction effect [(self_p N self_n) N (other_p N other_n)] yielded a large activation in the vmPFC (maximum peak at 14/42/−4, T = 5.17, size = 1621 voxels), including a peak at −6/34/−6 (T = 3.95), however at a more liberal threshold (pFWE-corrs b .05 at the cluster level, with p b .001 at the voxel level). This interaction conﬁrms that the difference in regression slopes for positive and negative base rates was indeed speciﬁc for self-related judgments.  Neural correlates of updates during base rate presentation  In self-trials with undesirable base rates (self_n), there was an inverse correlation between the BOLD response to base rates and updates in a network including the thalamus, the fusiform gyrus extending into the hippocampus, occipital areas, vStr and the dmPFC (see Table 3B and Fig. 4). Thus, during the reception of undesirable self-related base rates, the activity in these regions was greater the lower the size of subsequent updates.  The reported self_n effect also remained signiﬁcant in the majority of the identiﬁed regions when conducting a one sample t-test at the second level of analysis including the parametric regressor relating to self_n (dmPFC, thalamus, lingual gyrus, vStr; puncorrs N .002, Ts N 3.3), however at a less stringent signiﬁcance threshold. In addition, when repeating the same analysis, but with within-subject standardized update values instead of raw update values, we could replicate the  Table 2 Descriptive statistics of optimism bias measures and questionnaire scores in the overall sample and in the sub-samples with low and high trait optimism.  ⁎ Biasself Biasother ⁎ Biasself_other 1stEself_other LOT-R⁎ BDI⁎  All participants (n = 24)  Low trait optimism (n = 13)  High trait optimism (n = 11)  Min/Max −4.54/8.00 −3.87/4.47 −2.91/8.54 −19.67/2.45 8/22 0/11  M (SD)  2.55 (3.11) 1.24 (2.54) 1.31 (3.26) −7.29 (5.86) 17.00 (3.60) 3.88 (3.14)  Min/Max −4.54/5.03 −1.86/3.81 −2.91/4.44 −19.67/2.45 8/17 1/11  M (SD)  0.70 (2.69) 1.47 (2.12) ‐0.77 (2.11) 7.29 (6.53) 14.33 (2.90) 5.58 (3.09)  Min/Max  ‐0.31/8.00 −3.87/4.47 −1,52/8.54 −17.23/0.37 18/22 0/5  M (SD)  4.20 (0.79) 0.51 (3.01) 3.69 (3.09) 7.29 (5.27) 20.10 (1.45) 1.70 (0.65)  Biasself = mean updates after desirable information − mean updates after undesirable information, in self-trials; Biasother = mean updates after desirable information − mean updates after undesirable information, in other-trials; Biasself_other = biasself − biasother; 1stEself_other, 1st estimateself − 1st estimateother; LOT-R, Life Orientation Test, assessing trait optimism on a scale from 0 (pessimistic) to 24 (optimistic); BDI, Beck Depression Inventory, assessing symptoms of depression on a scale from 0 (minimal) to 63 (maximal).

No comparable effect was present for other-related judgments (other_n, inverse correlation). Moreover, the direct comparison (other_n N self_n) yielded the same network as the inverse self_n contrast alone, however at a more liberal threshold (puncorrs b .001, Ts N 3.7). This comparison indicates that the increasing activation of the described network with decreasing subsequent updates during the processing of negative base rates was indeed speciﬁc for self-related judgments.  Control variables  In order to examine whether the update-related effects might be related to the size of the presented base rates, or to the size of estimation errors, we computed the supplementary analyses with parametric modulation by base rates and estimation errors, respectively, instead of updates (see Tables S.4 and S.5). Relative to the main results of parametric modulation by updates reported in the “Neural correlates of updates during the second estimation” section and in the “Neural correlates of updates during the reception of base rates” section, these  158  B.

Activity in the subgenual ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during self-related belief updating reﬂected the subjective value of belief updates. The direct comparison between self-trials with positive and negative base rates revealed a differential within-subject correlation between the activity in the vmPFC and the size of belief updates. After positive base rates (self_p) there was a positive correlation between the BOLD response and the size of updates: The larger the updates, the stronger the BOLD response. Conversely, after negative base rates (self_n) there was an inverse correlation between the BOLD response and the size of updates: The smaller the update, the stronger the BOLD response. This activation pattern reﬂects the subjective value of updating: Both large updates leading to an improvement of future outlooks relative to the initial belief, and small updates (or refraining from updating) toward worse future outlooks are expected to have a positive subjective value, and were accompanied by an increased BOLD response in the vmPFC. Error bars show 90% CI.  analyses revealed no similarities or overlaps, indicating that the updaterelated effects cannot be accounted for by the inﬂuence of the base rates or estimation errors.  Moreover, because of the correlation between updates and estimation errors (see Table S.1), we examined more closely whether the differential BOLD signals reported in the “Neural correlates of updates during the second estimation” section and in the “Neural correlates of updates during the reception of base rates” section were better accounted for by updates than by estimation errors. For each phase of the trial (second estimation and base rate presentation), we computed two separate ﬁrst level models (Wood et al., 2008). One model included updates as parametric modulators, and the other model included estimation errors as parametric modulators. In order to scale the estimated regression parameters uniformly, the parameters representing estimation errors and updates were standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (Wood et al., 2008). Note that we did not include the updates and estimation errors simultaneously into one model because of high correlations between these two variables. The resulting multicollinearity would have compromised the estimation of model  parameters and the interpretability of separate parametric modulators (Wood et al., 2008).  At the second level of the comparative analysis relating to second estimation, a ﬂexible factorial model with two regressors relating to parametric modulation of self_p and self_n by updates, and with two regressors relating to parametric modulation of self_p and self_n by estimation errors were computed, and the vmPFC cluster from Table 3A was used as search volume. In accordance with the ﬁnding that only update but not estimation error was a signiﬁcant predictor of the differential activity in the vmPFC, the interaction effect [(self_pupdate N self_nupdate) N (self_pestimation error N self_nestimation error)] revealed that the effect of updates on differential activity in the vmPFC was signiﬁcantly stronger than the one of estimation errors (T = 2.77, pFWE-corr = .030, peak at −6/38/−8, cluster size 34).  At the second level of the comparative analysis relating to base rate presentation, a ﬂexible factorial model with two regressors relating to parametric modulation of self_n by updates and estimation errors, respectively, was computed and the signiﬁcant clusters from Table 3B (inverse contrast self_n) were used as search volume.

The greater recruitment of the network including the thalamus (Th), the fusiform gyrus extending into the hippocampus (Hipp), the primary visual cortex (V1), the ventral striatum (vStr) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the smaller the subsequent belief updates resulting in an undesirable future outlook.  B.

For the thalamus, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the dmPFC the difference was signiﬁcant only at a threshold not corrected for multiple comparisons (puncorrs b .05, Ts N 1.96).  Note that as we used the results reported in the “Neural correlates of updates during the second estimation” section and in the “Neural correlates of updates during the reception of base rates” section as search volumes, the comparative analyses at the second level are biased in favor of analyses based on updates. Importantly, however, the comparative analyses were not conducted to examine whether updates or estimation errors can generally better account for the data, but to show that the update-dependent activation patterns are indeed signiﬁcantly better accounted for by updates than by estimation errors.  Differential neural correlates of updates dependent on trait optimism  Comparisons of the BOLD response patterns in all reported local maxima between subsamples with low and high trait optimism revealed only one signiﬁcant difference, relating to the activity in the Rolandic operculum extending into the insula that exhibited an inverse correlation with updates (see Table 3, self_p, inverse correlation).  Discussion  The overall behavioral data corroborate prior ﬁndings of decreased updating in response to undesirable new information, and indicate that this effect is stronger for judgments referring to oneself than to others (Kuzmanovic et al., 2015; Sharot et al., 2011). The interaction effect reﬂecting the particularly strong optimism bias for self-referential judgments was also signiﬁcant when using standardized update values, which control for inter-individual differences in the general tendency to update initial estimates. Moreover, the self-speciﬁc optimism bias in updates was independent of the size of ﬁrst and second estimates, as well as of the size of presented base rates and induced estimation errors. Debrieﬁng revealed that the participants were not aware of their biased belief updating. More speciﬁcally, none of the participants were aware that the difference in updating after desirable and undesirable information matters for the research question and that they generated such a difference in their own updating. This indicates that the optimism bias in belief updating represents a covert and unintentional inﬂuence on judgments. This spontaneous dismissal of negative information calling for unfavorable belief adjustments constitutes a possible mechanism for maintaining optimism in the face of challenging new evidence (Hughes and Zaki, 2015; Sharot et al., 2011), which is particularly important when beliefs are self-relevant.  Finally, the behavioral results showed that the update behavior was modulated by trait optimism. Only highly trait-optimistic participants, but not those scoring low on trait optimism, showed the selfprotective update pattern that selectively neglects undesirable selfreferential information, without at the same time exhibiting such a bias for other-related judgments. Along with the cross-correlations between trait optimism, self-reported depression symptoms, and biased updating, these results support the view that optimistic distortions in judgment formation are related to affective states and to general expectations toward the future. However, there was no signiﬁcant correlation between trait optimism and the initial tendency to estimate one's own risks for adverse events to be lower than those of similar others (i.e., before being provided with base rates, 1stEself_other), in good accordance with the literature referring to ‘comparative optimism’ (Shepperd et al., 2002).  The primary aim of the fMRI data analyses was to provide empirical support for the assumed motivational causes of the optimism bias.  Such motivational explanations relate to the assumed pleasure of favorable self-referential prospective thinking, and to decision processes guided by these desired end-states of judgments (D'Argembeau et al., 2009; Hughes and Zaki, 2015; Sharot et al., 2011; Shepperd et al., 2002). In contrast to previous research launching the present paradigm (Sharot et al., 2011), we focused on the neural correlates of updates, and not on those of estimation errors, because updates are expected to reﬂect the subjective value of the adjusted expectation toward the future more closely than estimation errors. For completeness, we report and discuss replications of previous results relating to estimation errors (Sharot et al., 2011) in the Supplementary Material (S.4, S.8 and S.10). Importantly, we could show that the effects in the vmPFC and the vStr represent unique update-dependent variance in the BOLD signal, which is different from the one relating to estimation errors, or base rates.  In the following, we discuss the neural correlates of updates during the second estimation and during the reception of base rates, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the point of updating during the period from the presentation of the base rates up to the response indicating the ﬁnal estimate, we roughly assume that the presentation of base rates represents an early and preliminary stage of the judgment formation process, while the phase immediately before the response indicating the second estimate represents the ﬁnal decision.  Neural correlates of updates during the second estimation  The differential subjective value of self-referential belief updates at the time point of the ﬁnal update decision was reﬂected by the activity in the subgenual vmPFC: The BOLD response increased both with increasing favorable and with decreasing unfavorable updates. In other words, both large favorable belief updates, and small unfavorable belief updates (or refraining from updating) were associated with increased activity in the vmPFC. Critically, this activation pattern was not present during judgments regarding similar others, and the interaction term conﬁrmed that it was speciﬁc for judgments concerning oneself (however at a more liberal threshold, see the “fMRI data” section). Note that for both favorable and unfavorable updating, the size of updates represents the adjustment of the ﬁrst estimate toward the presented base rate, which in both conditions results (mostly) in positive signed values (i.e., after positive/lower base rates, a lower second estimate was expected, thus update was computed as ﬁrst estimate − second estimate, and vice versa). From the point of view of the judging subject, both large belief updates toward smaller risks, and small or zero belief updates toward higher risks have a positive value. Thus, the vmPFC reﬂected the particularly salient subjective value of belief updates relating to one's own future risks.  While the vmPFC has been shown to play a central role in representing the subjective value of emotional stimuli and rewards (Levy and Glimcher, 2012; Ochsner et al., 2012; Winecoff et al., 2013), it also has been associated with other cognitive functions, for instance with encoding of personal signiﬁcance (D'Argembeau, 2013; Kim and Johnson, 2015). Nevertheless, two reasons speak for the interpretation implying the representation of values. First, our ﬁndings are highly speciﬁc: the activity in the vmPFC increased with increasing favorable updates, and decreased with increasing unfavorable updates. Explanations relating to personal signiﬁcance cannot account for these conversely directed results because increasing sizes of both favorable and unfavorable updates should be of similar personal signiﬁcance. Second, favorable belief updating recruited speciﬁcally the subgenual region of the vmPFC (also termed subgenual or subcallosal cingulate), which exactly overlaps with the only correlate of expected value reported by the most recent meta-analysis of human neuroimaging studies using reinforcement learning models (Chase et al., 2015, peak coordinates 4/34/−6; see also Levy and Glimcher, 2012). In addition, probabilistic frameworks using large-scale mappings between human  160  B.

Therefore, it can be argued that the differential engagement of the subgenual vmPFC supports the notion that favorable beliefs are associated with pleasure and emotional beneﬁts, comparable to rewards.  Recently, the subgenual vmPFC has been related to motivational inﬂuences on self-referential cognition beyond the general representation of positive values and rewards. At the between-subject level, trait optimism scores correlated with the differential activity in the vmPFC while imagining self-referential positive future events relative to negative ones (Sharot et al., 2007). The vmPFC was also recruited by processing positive personality traits relative to negative ones (Beer and Hughes, 2010), particularly when they were regarded as selfdescriptive relative to non-descriptive (Moran et al., 2006), or were ascribed to close vs. non-close others (Hughes and Beer, 2012). However, while these studies on self-enhancing processing were always compounded with the general effect of valence of stimuli (e.g., positive vs. negative traits or events), our study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that the subgenual vmPFC tracks the affective meaning of judgments, independently of the valence of judged stimuli. The subjective value in the present task is deﬁned by trial-to-trial ﬂuctuations of belief updating, which were always related to risks of experiencing negative future events. In such an overall negative context of reasoning, the subjective value of the ﬁnal belief is computed relative to the avoided, relatively worst alternative. In accordance with this, a computational modeling study recently demonstrated that successful avoidance of options associated with a high probability of punishment (75% probability of losing 0.5€) in favor of options associated with a lower risk of punishment (25% probability of loss) can acquire a positive value, although the chosen and the avoided options are both not rewarding per se (Palminteri et al., 2015). Similarly, in the context of stimuli with positive and negative valences, the vmPFC activity correlated with personal, self-reported ratings rather than with objective stimulus characteristics (Winecoff et al., 2013). Thus, the subgenual vmPFC seems to be involved in the internal computation of values of beliefs, even in the absence of the actual satisfying (future) event outcome, and irrespective of the presence of rewarding stimuli per se (Leary, 2007). In turn, such internally modulated subjective values may play a critical role in emotion regulation and positively biased judgment formation (Ochsner et al., 2012).  Additional – yet indirect – support for the speciﬁc role of the subgenual vmPFC in motivated cognition during self-referential judgments comes from depression research. Particularly the subgenual vmPFC shows critical dysfunctions in patients with major depression, and is the target region of deep brain stimulation in treatmentresistant patients (Holtzheimer et al., 2012; Lozano et al., 2008). At the same time, depression has been associated with decreased optimism bias in belief updating (Garrett et al., 2014; Korn et al., 2014), and impaired emotion regulation (Joormann and Quinn, 2014). Thus, adaptive interactions between the mood state, belief formation, and reward and emotional reactivity seem to critically depend on the dense neural connections crossing the subgenual vmPFC.  At the time of the ﬁnal update decision, additional brain regions in which the activity inversely correlated with the size of updates were revealed. Because these ﬁndings are not directly related to our research question, we do not discuss them in detail.  and undesirable base rates there was an inverse correlation between the subsequent update size and the activity in a network of regions including the thalamus, the fusiform gyrus extending into the hippocampus, early visual regions, the vStr and the dmPFC. In other words, the more participants recruited this network while being confronted with self-related undesirable base rates, the less they subsequently updated their initial estimate. A direct comparison conﬁrmed that the effect was speciﬁc for judgments relating to oneself relative to those about others (however at a more liberal threshold, see the “fMRI data” section). Consequently, this network may play a crucial role in dismissing the relevance of self-relevant unfavorable information in the early stage of the judgment formation process.  However, the exact cognitive processes involved in suppressing belief updates in response to undesirable information cannot be deducted from our data, as we did not assess the speciﬁc thoughts or judgment criteria of the participants. Based on theoretical frameworks of comparative thinking (Mussweiler, 2003) and prior ﬁndings regarding the selection of the “average target” (Shepperd et al., 2002) we can make some suggestions regarding possible interpretations of the predictive coding of unfavorable updates. Possibly, personal characteristics (e.g., family history, life style and precautionary intentions) are selectively recalled in a way to support a relatively decreased personal risk compared to the average person. For instance, when confronted with an unexpectedly high base rate for a disease, one could recall one's own healthy lifestyle that contrasts the overall unhealthy lifestyle of the “average person” to promote the conclusion that high risks do not need to be applied to oneself. This speculation is in good accordance with the known functional roles of the recruited network. The hippocampus (Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012) and the dmPFC (Spreng and Grady, 2010; Spreng et al., 2009) are associated with mnestic, inferential and prospective processing necessary for case speciﬁc reasoning. Furthermore, the vStr and the thalamus play an important role in reward learning, which suggests that their involvement may reﬂect the adjustment of the information processing in line with the anticipated value of the ensuing belief updates (Galvan et al., 2005).  The predictive engagements of the vStr in the early stage of judgment formation and of the vmPFC in its ﬁnal phase ﬁt well with the differential functions suggested for these core components of the neural reward circuitry. While the vStr has been related to prediction errors and to the formation of preferences early after the confrontation with the target stimulus, the vmPFC has reﬂected the conceptual, abstract value of outcomes (Chase et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2007; O'Doherty, 2004; Roy et al., 2012). Thus, in order to dismiss information calling for unfavorable future outlooks, vStr may provide rapid signals that are able to interact with and inﬂuence other cognitive processes in order to achieve more valuable subsequent decision outcomes (Kim et al., 2007). In addition, the previous demonstration that such coding of initial preferences by the vStr occurs automatically, i.e., even in the absence of the explicit instruction to evaluate the value of a stimulus (Kim et al., 2007), is consistent with the fact that the participants in our study were not aware of their selective neglect of undesirable, self-relevant base rates during their belief updating.  In contrast to self-relevant judgment formation, undesirable information relevant for judgments about others engaged a network adjacent to the white matter with signiﬁcant but weak inverse correlations with subsequent updates.  Limitations  Neural correlates of updates during the reception of base rates  Our second analysis of the fMRI data focused on the correlation between updates and the BOLD signal during the base rate presentation. This analysis aimed to explore which neural activity predicts the size of the subsequent estimate adjustment at the moment of being confronted with the disproving information. For self-related judgments  While we found signiﬁcantly different behavioral patterns of belief updating between subsamples with high and low trait optimism, comparing these subsamples with respect to their neural correlates did not reveal signiﬁcant differences (with one exception, contrast self_p, inverse correlation, see Table 3A). This indicates that the described neural responses to updates varying in size and desirability represent a  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  161  common feature of processing self-referential information, independent of inter-individual differences in general expectations toward the future. Another possible explanation is that non-signiﬁcant results may be related to the inﬂated type II error due to the small subsample sizes recruited in our study. In addition to this general problem, the low variance of trait optimism may also explain the lack of signiﬁcant differences in the neural correlates. However, recruiting participants with low trait optimism and negative self-views might require a systematic search because about 70% of the general population tend to have positive self-views (Swann and Jennifer, 2010).  Two other limitations of the present study relate to the estimation errors. First, our algorithm for manipulation of estimation errors could not achieve perfectly balanced errors between the conditions because the mean positive estimation errors were lower than the negative ones (for more details see also S.1). While the range of the manipulated errors was still better controlled than if we had taken true and ﬁxed base rates, the algorithm should be improved to enable a fully balanced error computation. Critically, the interpretation of our behavioral results in terms of an optimistic bias is not questioned by this imbalance, because formal learning models predict that the updating should be greater the bigger the estimation error. Although in positive trials the estimation errors were on average smaller, the mean belief updating was signiﬁcantly larger. Consequently, the smaller estimation errors in positive trials indicate that the optimism bias may even be underestimated to some extent.  The second limitation relates to the imprecise assessment of subjectively experienced estimation errors (see also SI2 and Kuzmanovic et al., 2015). While formally the estimation error corresponds to the difference between the participants' ﬁrst estimate and the presented base rate in each trial of the experiment, the participants may not perceive this difference as an indication that their initial judgment was erroneous because of personal vulnerabilities or resources. For instance, a strong family history of cancer may suggest a higher personal risk of suffering from cancer relative to the population base rate, so that a presentation of a lower population base rate need not be perceived as an error. In order to further improve the methodological precision of the paradigm, subjective estimation errors should be more carefully assessed.  Conclusion  Different ways of assessing the optimism bias exist, yet little is known about the underlying psychological processes and neural mechanisms. Our ﬁndings suggest that particularly when making judgments regarding one's own future and being confronted with undesirable information that calls for belief adjustments toward unfavorable future outlooks, a network including the vStr, the thalamus, the hippocampus, and the dmPFC is activated in order to prevent detrimental updating. More speciﬁcally, the more these regions associated with rewardbased learning and complex cognitive processing (including memory retrieval, mental visual emulation and inferential reasoning) were activated, the smaller the subsequent unfavorable update. During the ﬁnal computation of self-related belief updates, the positive value of these salient decisions was mirrored by the subgenual vmPFC: Both large belief updates toward better future outcomes, and refraining from updates that would have led to worse future outcomes have a positive subjective value and were accompanied by an increased activity. The fact that central nodes of the neural reward circuitry were recruited dependent on the valence of self-referential judgments provides empirical evidence that cognitive and motivational processes are closely intertwined in optimistic distortions in reasoning. Our ﬁndings support the conclusion that the human cognitive system is motivationally predisposed to dismiss undesirable information and attend to desirable information due to the emotional value of the so achieved optimistic judgment outcomes.

The present study aims to further understanding of working memory in normal aging using a large cohort of healthy elderly in order to examine three separate phases of information processing in relation to changes in task load activation.  Using covariance analysis, increasing and decreasing neural activation was observed on fMRI in response to a delayed item recognition task in 337 cognitively healthy elderly persons as part of the CRESCENDO (Cognitive REServe and Clinical ENDOphenotypes) study.  During three phases of the task (stimulation, retention, probe), increased activation was observed with increasing task load in bilateral regions of the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobule, cingulate gyrus, insula and in deep gray matter nuclei, suggesting an involvement of central executive and salience networks. Decreased activation associated with increasing task load was observed during the stimulation phase, in bilateral temporal cortex, parietal lobule, cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex. This spatial distribution of decreased activation is suggestive of the default mode network.  These ﬁndings support the hypothesis of an increased activation in salience and central executive net works and a decreased activation in default mode network concomitant to increasing task load.

The working memory model comprises a ‘‘central executive” responsible for information ﬁltering and integration, and two sub-systems manipulating and temporarily maintaining verbal and visual information (the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad), and has been  212  C.

It has become one of the principal targets for studies of both normal age-related cognitive changes and neuropathologies such as dementia and depression.  respectively  (Smith,  areas  left-hemisphere  Early animal research on the neuronal and neurotransmitter bases of working memory located it principally in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Fuster, 1973). Subsequent PET and fMRI studies in humans have conﬁrmed the central role of the PFC but have further indicated activation throughout the cortex, notably in parietal areas, with spatial and verbal stimuli recruiting principally right and Jonides, Marshuetz, & Koeppe, 1998). Moreover, it has recently been suggested that the PFC may be the principal area associated with information management, with more posterior areas, including the parietal cortex, possibly having a prominent role in information maintenance. This hypothesis has been based on ﬁndings that both areas showing increased interactivity during working memory tasks (Curtis & D’Esposito, 2003; Nee et al., 2013; Rottschy, Caspers, & Roski, 2013). Recent research aimed at differentiating the brain regions involved in working memory have principally used delayed recognition tasks such as Delayed Item Recognition (DIR) (Coltheart, 2006). These tasks enable the differentiation of the three phases of working memory: target/stimulation, delay/ retention and probe/response covering (i) information recording, allowing rapid conversion of visual (or auditory) space into phonological code, and initialization of the phonological loop whether the memorandum allow a verbalization, (ii) the consolidation of articulatory rehearsal, in order to reiterate the phonological loop and actively maintain the memory trace, (iii) retrieval of stored information and its use in decision-making processes.  Functional MRI studies of DIR tasks (Manoach, Greve, Lindgren, & Dale, 2003; Marvel & Desmond, 2010; Nystrom et al., 2000) have reported speciﬁc activation of several brain regions for each of the three phases of working memory functioning: parietal lobules, ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, deep gray matter nuclei, cingulate gyrus, temporal lateral cortex and occipital cortex during the stimulation and retention phase and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula and deep gray matter nuclei during the probe phase. (Cairo, Liddle, Woodward, & Ngan, 2004; Chen & Desmond, 2005). While previous research has principally focused on differentiating activation associated with speciﬁc working memory phases, more recent work has begun to explore the consequences on neural activity of increasing DIR task difﬁculty. To date, two studies (Ansado et al., 2013; Zarahn et al., 2007) of neural network activation (task load) associated with increased task difﬁculty, comparing older and younger healthy individuals found that older individuals demonstrate increased neural activation with increasing load for the same level of performance compared to younger adults. Two case control studies comparing healthy older and younger adults (Sambataro et al., 2010) and mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease subjects (Rombouts, Barkhof, Goekoop, Stam, & Scheltens, 2005) observed decreased neural activity with increasing DIR task difﬁculty in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, inferior parietal lobules and superior and inferior temporal cortex. These areas are described as part of the default mode network (Greicius & Menon, 2004), a network involved in judgment, retrieval and manipulation of episodic memory and semantic knowledge (Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss, & Menon, 2003), selfreferential processing (Gusnard & Raichle, 2001) and mind wandering (Christoff, Gordon, Smallwood, Smith, & Schooler, 2009). The principal shortcoming of previous studies of working memory in the elderly has been the small number of subjects, and given the heterogeneity of elderly persons in relation to health-related variables, it is not surprising that there has been considerable inconsistency in the ﬁndings.  The aim of the present research is to extend knowledge of the multiple and concomitant cognitive processes involved in the maintenance of normal working memory in healthy elderly persons by studying each phase of information processing in working memory in relation to increasing/decreasing task load activation. The study is carried out in a much larger elderly cohort than has previously been examined, thus reducing bias due to sample selection.  2. Methods  2.1. Cohort  The data were derived from the on-going prospective Montpellier-Three-City study (The 3C Study Group, 2003) in which 2259 volunteers (recruited from the electoral rolls), aged 65 years and older, underwent standardized neurological examinations in a dedicated clinical research facility. The clinical examinations were undertaken at baseline (1999–2001) and 2, 4, 7, 10 and 12 years. At 12-year follow-up, participants who were free of dementia and had a Mini Mental State Examination MMSE (Folstein, Folstein, & McHug, 1975) score over 24 were invited to undergo an MRI and complementary clinical examination as part of the CRESCENDO (Cognitive REServe and Clinical ENDOphenotype) study (n = 380). The clinical examination for CRESCENDO participants was carried out approximately 8 months before the MRI examination. Subjects were only able to participate if able to travel to the clinical center and did not have any contraindication for the MRI examination. The diagnosis of dementia was based on a 3-step procedure. First, trained psychologists administered a battery of neuropsychological tests detailed elsewhere (Akbaraly et al., 2009). Second, all the participants were then examined by a neurologist, Finally, an independent committee of neurologists reviewed all potential prevalent and incident cases of dementia to obtain a consensus diagnosis according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Similar procedures were performed at each phase over the 12-years of follow-up for incident dementia screening. Cases of AD were classiﬁed according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzhei mer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (McKhann et al., 1984) and cases of mixed/vascular dementia according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke – Association Internationale pour la Recherche en l’Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria (Román et al., 1993).  The study was carried out at the neuroradiology department of the Montpellier University Hospital Human Functional Imaging Institute (I2FH), France. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University-Hospital of Bicêtre, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Characteristics of the 380 CRESCENDO participants have been compared to the characteristics of dementia-free participants of the MontpellierThree-City study who underwent the 12-y follow-up examination but who were not included in the CRESCENDO study. Recorded clinical data were: laterality (Edinburgh handedness inventory), Body Mass Index, educational level, current lifestyle, MMSE and cardiovascular disease.  2.2. Delayed item recognition task  Working memory was assessed by a DIR task using letter stimuli (Sternberg, 1966), schematized in Fig. 1 (Zarahn et al., 2007). Each trial of the DIR task consisted of 3 phases: stimulation, retention and probe. The stimulation phase is based on the presentation over 3 s of an array of one, three or six capital letters (the number  C. Charroud et al. / Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 125 (2015) 211–223  213  Fig. 1. Schema of the Delay Item Recognition (DIR) task. Each trial of the DIR task included 3 phases: (1) stimulation phase: presentation over 3 s of one, three or six capital letters, (2) retention phase: presentation over 7 s of a blank screen and (3) probe phase: presentation over 3 s of one lowercase letter where subjects indicate whether or not the letter matched with the study array. An inter-trial interval consisting of the presentation of a blank screen over three seconds marked the beginning of each trial. Subjects underwent 3 runs each containing 30 trials (10 trials for each of the three set sizes: 1, 3 or 6 letters pseudo-randomly sequenced) with ﬁve true negative and ﬁve true positive probes per set.  of letters being the set size) the participants having been instructed to remember these letters. During the retention phase, participants were instructed to focus their gaze on the blank screen during 7 s and hold the stimulus items in mind. In the probe phase, a lowercase letter is shown in the center of the screen for three seconds, participants indicate by pressing a button whether or not the probe matched a letter in the study array (right index ﬁnger button press to indicate ‘yes’, left index ﬁnger button press to indicate ‘no’). An inter-trial interval consisting of the presentation of a blank screen for three seconds marked the beginning of each trial. In addition, 70 blank trials (presentation of a blank screen for 2 s) were pseudo-randomly interspersed between trials in each run to reduce the likelihood of neurophysiological responses predictive of the beginning of trials. As indicated in Fig. 1, participants underwent 3 runs each containing 30 trials (10 trials for each of the three set sizes: 1, 3 or 6 letters pseudo-randomly sequenced via a random-without-replacement scheme.) with ﬁve true negative and ﬁve true positive probes per set size. Participants were instructed to respond as accurately as possible. No feedback about performance accuracy was given during the scanning session.  DIR task performance is analyzed according to 3 phases representing (1) the encoding process during the stimulation phase; (2) maintenance processes during retention and (3) the retrieval process during the probe phase. The number of letters determines the level of stimulus difﬁculty, thus differentiating memory-load level. Before fMRI acquisition, participants were trained on at least 2 DIR runs of 30 trials each (the ﬁrst one of which was administered with feedback) on a computer with the help of a neuropsychologist. Vision correction was performed by an ophthalmologist using nonmagnetic glasses in the range of  5 to +3 with 0.5 diopter steps (MediGlasses, Cambridge Research Systems).  2.3. Magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition  Task stimuli were back-projected onto a screen located at the foot of the MRI bed using an LCD projector. Participants viewed the screen via a mirror located in the head coil. Task responses were made on a NordicNeuroLab system (Bergen, Norway, www.  nordicneurolab.com) and behavioral data were recorded on the task computer. Task onset was electronically synchronized with the MRI acquisition computer with the NordicNeuroLab SyncBox. Task administration and data collection (response time and percentage of correct responses) were controlled using publicly available code (https://github.com/steffejr/InterferenceLetterSternberg) developed using Psychotoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/PsychtoolboxDownload). Following the scanning session, DIR task performance (response time and percentage of correct responses) was recorded for each level of difﬁculty. MatLab software (The Mathworks Inc.; MA, USA, R2012a) was used for visual stimulus presentation and recording responses.  Whole brain functional MR images were acquired using a 3Tesla magnet (Skyra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel receive-only head coil. Three hundred sixteen volumes of BOLD Gradient Echo-echo planar images (GE-EPI) were obtained during the functional MRI Sternberg Task with the following imaging parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 20 ms, 39 axial slices, slice thickness 3 mm, slices order: interleaved, in plane resolution 2.39  2.39 mm2, no interslice gap, interleaved, ﬂip angle 90°. The slices covered the whole brain extending from vertex to the upper parts of the cerebellum. For all participants, high-resolution anatomical images were acquired using a 3D magnetizationprepared, rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1690 ms; TE = 2.54 ms; TI = 922 ms; Flip angle 9°, aligned with the corpus callosum; voxel size: 1  1  1 mm; with 176 slices. Magnitude and phase images of the magnetic ﬁeld were acquired with a gradient echo-echo planar (GE-EPI) sequence (TR = 436 ms, TE1 = 4.92 ms, TE2 = 7.38 ms, voxels size: 2.56  2.56  3 mm, ﬂip angle 60°).  2.4. fMRI data pre-processing  Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK, http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac. uk/spm/software/spm8/) (Ashburner, 2012) was used as implemented in MatLab (The Mathworks Inc.; MA, USA, R2012a) for image preprocessing and statistical analyses.  214  C. Charroud et al. / Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 125 (2015) 211–223  It included corrections of magnetic ﬁeld distortion, scan acquisition time difference and head motion. Co-registration to the individual anatomical image was then performed. The anatomical images were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid using a uniﬁed segmentation algorithm as implemented in the ‘‘New segment” function of SPM8. A customized template was created based on the gray matter segmentations using a Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) (Ashburner, 2007). Using this procedure, the anatomical images of each subject were normalized with the created template, and then a mean image of all normalized 3DT1 was performed. Hence functional images were spatially normalized to the 3DT1 mean image and spatially smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁlter with a full width at half maximum of 8 mm to accommodate inter-individual anatomical variability.  2.5. fMRI statistical analyses  2.5.1. Time-series modeling  The GE-EPI time-series were modeled in a ﬁrst level general linear model (Friston et al., 1994) with regressors representing the expected BOLD fMRI response (implicitly, relative to the blank intervals) to the stimulation, retention and probe phases of the task, separately for each block and set size (1, 3 and 6) (Fig. 1). Trials on which there was either an incorrect or no motor response from the participant during the probe phase were modeled separately and not included in the second level analysis. Realignment parameters have been added in the regression models to remove speciﬁc activation due to head movement (translations ‘‘right”, ‘‘forward”, ‘‘up” and rotations ‘‘pitch”, ‘‘roll”, ‘‘yaw”) and a 128 s high-pass ﬁlter was used to remove non-physiological slow signal shifts. Three rectangular functions of duration were used to model neural response: one in the stimulation phase (3000 ms), one in the retention phase (7000 ms) and another in the probe phase (3000 ms). Contrasts were estimated for each load level and phase of the task, using a ﬁrst level general linear model approach. These parametric maps serve as the dependent variables for the subsequent second level covariance analysis (Habeck et al., 2005).  2.5.2. Covariance analyses  Ordinal Trend Canonical Variates Analysis (OrtCVA) was performed for the entire cohort to identify a unique pattern of signal covariance, with expression varying with load (i.e. gradual difﬁculty of the task). This approach is similar to other regional covariance analysis techniques (i.e. Partial Least Squares). It identiﬁes a group-level covariance pattern of task-related brain regions having monotonic increasing (or decreasing) levels of brain activation with increasing task load. This method has been described elsewhere (Habeck et al., 2003, 2005).  A single covariance pattern represents one preferred direction in the vector space determined by the value of activation in each voxel of the image. Neural responses according to increase in difﬁculty for each subject can thus be represented as moving along this preferred direction with individual differences appearing as a change in the degree of this displacement. Displacement therefore indicates the degree of change in response to increase in difﬁculty. The aim is then to identify a pattern of covariance including the similarities between three difﬁculty levels for which the degree of expression may vary. Consequently, this approach does not focus on a particular region or on the activation of one condition of interest, but on changes in regional activation induced by increasing difﬁculty for each subject.  The ﬁrst step consists of a principal components analysis to identify the preferred directions of information; each component corresponding to a direction. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used to select the most relevant components and indicate  privileged directions of interest in the vector space. This criterion, based on the best bias-variance trade-off, can estimate the quality of each model relative to each of the other models (Burnham & Anderson, 2004) thus aiming to reduce the number of components and describe the data with the lowest possible number of components. The preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value. Finally, the covariance model corresponds to the linear combination of the selected principal components. The coefﬁcients of this linear combination are obtained by multiple linear regression with the coefﬁcients representing the best linear mean trend across the three levels of difﬁculty.  The objective of the OrtCVA method is to obtain one wholebrain mapping (at voxel level) whose activations increase and/or decrease with increasing difﬁculty of the task. The different weights of each voxel are assigned by the obtained linear model. A bootstrap estimation procedure is performed to assess this weight in each voxel of the entire group. A map of the group representing this weight is thus obtained and converted into a z score. For instance, if the weight of the voxel is denoted w and its standard deviation is s, the result is: z = w/s. By thresholding the map by a z-score (e.g. |z| = 2.33), the activation will be obtained with a speciﬁc one-tailed probability (e.g., p < 0.01) according to the assumptions of a standard-normal distribution. Thus, the absolute value of weight determines the slope of change. For example, a region whose weight is twice as large as another region indicates that the slope of the activation in this region is twice as high as another region. Positive voxel weights indicate an increased activation with increasing task load while negative voxel weights indicate a decreased activation with increasing task load. The end result of this analysis is a single group level covariance pattern of brain activity demonstrating monotonic changes with increasing task load for each phase of the DIR task. A threshold of |z| = 2.33 for each phase, corresponding to p < 0.01, is applied (Habeck et al., 2005; Moeller & Habeck, 2006).  The property of a monotonic increase/decrease of brain activity with increasing within-subject load is called an ‘‘ordinal trend” and quantiﬁed by repeated-measures F-statistics. It is represented by a p-value generated by a random permutation test. The goal of this test is to sample data at least 1000 times with a random subject/condition using the same set of principal components calculated in the ﬁrst estimation of the model. It provides an additional validation criterion to ensure that the observed covariance model corresponds to activation changes with increasing task load. This test can thus improve the sensitivity of the OrtCVA method without lowering its speciﬁcity.  Data quality control may also be carried out by reporting the number of subjects (number of exceptions) that do not follow the linear trend. When the number of exceptions is high, the linear trend is assumed to not be respected. In addition, the signiﬁcance of the obtained linear model is estimated by a permutation test whose result is a p-value. The aim of this permutation test is to switch subjects (1000 times) to assess the number of exceptions to the obtained linear model for each iteration. If the number of exceptions is lower than that the number of exceptions obtained in the ﬁrst model calculated, the signiﬁcance increases. Thus, the model will be considered signiﬁcant if p < 0.05. Finally, participants that deviate from a monotonic trend are detected and the analysis is not carried out if (1) this occurred for more than 30% of the entire group, (2) the random permutation test generated a p-level higher than 0.05.  In contrast, the analogous general linear model analysis (using SPM) involves voxel-wise analysis of hemodynamic response between task load. This approach is performed using orthogonal contrast for the linear trend which did not focus on the activation changes across load levels. The information relating to the variability of increasing task load between subjects is not taken into  C. Charroud et al. / Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 125 (2015) 211–223  215  account. The OrtCVA method is thus a more stringent validation method than the general linear model in determining pattern variation according to load (D’Esposito, Deouell, & Gazzaley, 2003; Zarahn, Rakitin, Abela, Flynn, & Stern, 2006). However, using the OrtCVA method, comparisons between phases and correlations with a parameter (age, performance. . .) cannot be investigated on brain activation with increasing task load (Moeller & Habeck, 2006).  2.5.3. Statistical analyses of behavioral measures  Kruskall–Wallis non parametric tests were used to compare mean response time and accuracy between each level of task difﬁculty. Signiﬁcance was set at 5%, and statistical analyses were carried out with the R software version 3.0.2. All p values reported were not corrected for multiple testing.  3. Results  3.1. Participant characteristics  Of the 380 CRESCENDO participants, 337 subjects have been included in the present analysis (35 participants did not complete the DIR task and 8 were removed due to head movements during acquisition). Characteristics of the participants are detailed in Table 1.  As expected, an increase in response time and a decrease in percentage of accurate responses were observed with increasing difﬁculty of the DIR task. Mean (SD) for response time was: m = 1.04 (0.23) s for letter 1, m = 1.26 (0.24) s for letters 3 and m = 1.50 (0.29) s for letters 6 (p < 0.0001, two-tailed Kruskal–Wallis test).

Laterality was assessed by the Edinburgh handedness inventory questionnaire. Education level was classiﬁed as low (5 years of schooling or less), medium low (6–9 years), medium high (10– 12 years), and high (more than 12 years). Cognitive deﬁcit was assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination (cut-off for possible dementia < 24). Delayed item recognition task performances (response time and accuracy) are reported in each level of stimulus difﬁculty determined by the number of letters (Letter 1, Letter 3 and Letter 6). Abbreviations: BMI, Body Mass Index; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MMSE, Mini Mental State Examination.  Percentage of accuracy responses were: m = 0.97 (0.05) for letter 1, m = 0.96 (0.07) for letters 3 and m = 0.86 (0.11) for letters 6 (p < 0.0001, two-tailed Kruskal–Wallis test).  3.2. Covariance analyses  OrtCVA analyses identiﬁed covarying increasing and decreasing activation associated with increasing DIR task difﬁculty for the three task phases. Examining individual covariance patterns, the majority of participants were observed to show montonic change in expression with increasing task load as assessed by the permutation tests (98% in the stimulation phase, 88% in the retention phase, 70% in the probe phase).  3.2.1. Increased activation associated with increasing task load  Changes in neural activation, increasing simultaneously with increasing task difﬁculty, presumably reﬂect more effort on the part of subjects to encode, maintain and retrieve information in memory. Across the three phases of the DIR task, brain regions with covarying increased activation are detailed in Fig. 2 and Table 2. During the stimulation phase, we observed bilateral increased activation in the cerebellum (declive and vermis), precentral gyrus and bilateral deep gray matter nuclei (lentiform nucleus and thalamus). During the retention phase, we also observed bilateral increased activation in the cerebellum (culmen, declive, vermis), lateral temporal cortex (left middle and superior gyrus) and bilateral deep gray matter nuclei (caudate nucleus). During the probe phase, we found bilateral increased activation in the fusiform gyrus and bilateral deep gray matter nuclei (lentiform nucleus and thalamus).  Furthermore, some activated regions were similarly observed during the three phases of the DIR task in bilateral frontal lobes (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomesial prefrontal cortex), in bilateral parietal lobes (inferior and superior lobule), bilateral cingulate gyrus and bilateral insula.  3.2.2. Decreased activation associated with increasing task load  Covarying decreasing neural activation in response to increasing task difﬁculty, possibly indicating networks that have to be inhibited to maintain an accurate response, was observed over the three phases of the DIR task. Brain regions showing decreased activation associated with increasing task load are given in Fig. 3 and Table 3. During the stimulation phase, bilateral decreased activation was observed in occipital lobes (fusiform gyrus), parietal lobes (superior and inferior lobules), frontal lobes (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus), lateral temporal cortex (middle and superior temporal gyrus), cingulate gyrus and insula. During the retention phase we observed decreased activation in the occipital lobes (bilateral lingual gyrus, bilateral cuneus, left fusiform, bilateral middle occipital gyrus and left inferior occipital gyrus), limbic system (bilateral amygdala, bilateral cingulate gyrus and left parahippocampal gyrus), bilateral middle temporal gyrus, bilateral superior parietal lobule and left medial frontal gyrus and in areas of deep gray matter nuclei (bilateral putamen and bilateral thalamus). During the probe phase we found decreased activation in the left medial frontal gyrus, bilateral lingual gyrus, bilateral superior and middle temporal gyrus, bilateral cingulate gyrus and bilateral insula.  4. Discussion  The present fMRI study carried out on a large cohort of healthy elderly persons, aimed to explore normal brain response during different information processing phases of a working memory task  216  C. Charroud et al. / Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 125 (2015) 211–223  Fig. 2. Increased activation associated with increasing task load. Neural activation increasing simultaneously with the gradual increasing difﬁculty of the task, identiﬁed using the Ordinal Trend Canonical Variates Analysis (OrtCVA) method for 337 subjects. Regions with increased activation being statistically signiﬁcant (Z score P 2.33) are displayed on transverse slices (MNI space, MRIcroGL software, ch256 template) for (a) stimulation phase (b) retention phase and (c) probe phase of the DIR task. The label number is reported for each slice. The color bar indicates the Z score of activation. (a) During the stimulation phase, regions are activated bilaterally, in the cerebellum, frontal lobe (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomesial prefrontal cortex), parietal lobe (inferior and superior parietal lobules), lateral temporal cortex, insula, cingulate gyrus and in the deep gray matter nuclei (lentiform nucleus and thalamus). (b) During the retention phase, activation involves the same bilateral regions apart from lateral temporal cortex. (c) During the probe phase, activation is mainly seen bilaterally in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, in the superior parietal lobules, in the insula, in the cingulate gyrus and in the deep gray matter nuclei (lentiform nucleus and thalamus). (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)  with increasing task difﬁculty. We found a covarying network of brain regions displayed increased expression associated with increasing task load regardless of the task phase: the bilateral dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobule, bilateral cingulate gyrus and bilateral insula. These ﬁndings conﬁrm previous observations in younger persons, that mobilization of the working memory system involves predominantly, but not exclusively, PFC areas, with concomitant decreased expression in posterior regions. We found decreased activation to be associated with increasing task difﬁculty predominantly the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobules, and cingulate gyrus for the stimulation phase. The spatial distribution of this network suggests similarities with the default mode network during the stimulation phase. Patterns of activation in the PFC were not strongly left-hemisphere dominant although a verbal stimulus was used, probably because short termmaintenance has not been conﬁned to the rehearsal mechanisms of the articulatory loop.  Previous studies using this task have been based on very small numbers (N < 40) and have principally focused on younger subjects (ie < 30 year-old) (Cairo et al., 2004; Chang, Crottaz-Herbette, & Menon, 2007; Chen & Desmond, 2005; Desmond, Gabrieli, Wagner, Ginier, & Glover, 1997; Habeck et al., 2003, 2005; Holtzer et al., 2009; Marvel & Desmond, 2010) or young vs healthy elderly subjects (Ansado, Oury, Nourane, Faure, & Joanette, 2012; Zarahn et al., 2007), and used differing numbers of items (1–8 items) and types of encoding stimuli; letters (Ansado et al., 2013; Bunge, Ochsner, Desmond, Glover, & Gabrieli, 2001; Habeck et al., 2005; Zarahn et al., 2006, 2007), shapes (Holtzer et al., 2009) or numbers (Adler et al., 2001; Portas et al., 1998) thus limiting comparisons between studies. Moreover, these studies have focused either on speciﬁc DIR task phases (Habeck et al., 2005;  Zarahn et al., 2006, 2007) or all phases together (Ansado et al., 2013; Bunge et al., 2001). It is thus not surprising that previous observations have been inconsistent.  In studies using tasks other than the DIR task, few have provided information focused on decreased networks, in either young subjects (Greicius & Menon, 2004), comparing young vs healthy elderly subjects (Sambataro et al., 2010) or comparing healthy elderly subjects to subjects with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease (Rombouts et al., 2005); no studies have to date speciﬁcally focused on elderly subjects. By assessing concomitantly increasing and decreasing activation as a function of increased load, and by exploring each phase of a DIR task in order to examine separately the different cognitive processes of working memory in a large and homogeneous sample of healthy elderly participants, this study has signiﬁcantly reﬁned and expanded knowledge of working memory-related networks in an age cohort particularly vulnerable to working memory changes.  Although the most fMRI studies examine right-handed subjects only, our sample was composed of right (91.7), left (3.6%) and mixed (4.7%) handed subjects. Studies have shown that the spatial distribution of neural networks is mainly symmetrical between left and right-handed subjects (Li et al., 2014; Pool, Eickhoff, Fink, & Grefkes, 2014; Pujol, Deus, Losilla, & Capdevila, 1999; Saenger & Barrios, 2012). Consequently, in our study, we have included all participants regardless of handedness to ensure that our sample may be more exhaustive and representative of the general population of healthy elderly subjects.  4.1.

Decreased activation associated with increasing task load. Neural activation decreasing simultaneously with the gradual increasing difﬁculty of the task, identiﬁed using the Ordinal Trend Canonical Variates Analysis (OrtCVA) method is reported for 337 subjects. Regions with decreased activation being statistically signiﬁcant (Z score P 2.33) are displayed on transverse slices (MNI space, MRIcroGL software, ch256 template) for (a) stimulation phase (b) retention phase and (c) probe phase of the DIR task. The label number is reported for each slice. The color bar indicates the Z score of activation. a) During the stimulation phase, regions are decreased bilaterally, in the medial temporal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral, ventrolateral and dorsomesial). b) During the retention phase, decreased activation involves bilaterally the cingulate gyrus, the occipital cortex, the medial temporal cortex and the deep gray matter nuclei (lentiform nucleus and thalamus). c) During the probe phase, decreased activation are mainly seen bilaterally in the cingulate gyrus, the insula, and the lateral temporal cortex.

We found increased activation simultaneously with the gradual increasing difﬁculty of the task in bilateral cerebellum, bilateral cingulate gyrus, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left superior parietal lobule during the stimulation phase; bilateral cerebellum, right cingulate gyrus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobule and left middle temporal gyrus during retention; and bilateral regions of ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula and left thalamus during the probe phase. These ﬁndings are in accordance with those reported by only two studies (Habeck et al., 2003; Zarahn et al., 2007) assessing task load neural networks activation associated with DIR task of increasing difﬁculty. Furthermore, we observed activation in bilateral cerebellum during stimulation and retention phases, as previously reported by Chen and Marvel (Chen et al., 2013; Marvel & Desmond, 2010) suggesting that regions are involved in rapid articulatory mechanism. The cerebellum may  the cerebellar  contribute to articulatory preparation and phonological storage processes during the stimulation phase and to refreshment of the phonological store during retention phase.  During memory tasks, previous studies have identiﬁed the involvement of both salience and central executive networks (Bressler & Menon, 2010; Fecteau, Bell, & Munoz, 2004; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Sridharan, Levitin, & Menon, 2008). These networks have been observed previously using resting-state fMRI (Bressler & Menon, 2010; Chen et al., 2013; Damoiseaux et al., 2006; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Seeley et al., 2007; Sridharan et al., 2008). Several studies (Bressler & Menon, 2010; Bunge et al., 2001; Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000; Chen et al., 2013; Koechlin & Summerﬁeld, 2007; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Müller & Knight, 2006) have suggested that the central executive network is involved in high-level cognitive control and attentional processes by showing that the central executive network is activated during maintenance of information in working memory and during decision-making processes. The DIR task, combining working memory and decision-making processes, may thus be assumed to recruit the central executive network. The spatial distribution of the central executive network has been well described in the literature and appears to implicate bilateral dorsolateral and dorsomesial prefrontal cortex and bilateral lateral pari Table 3 Decreased activation associated with increasing task load.

In our study, we have identiﬁed these regions in each phase of the task, with increasing activation simultaneously with the gradual increasing task difﬁculty (see Table 4).  In addition to the central executive network, the salience network has also been hypothesized to be involved in working memory, especially in cognitive processes involving monitoring,  decision-making, and cognitive control (Bunge et al., 2001; Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000; Chen et al., 2013; Crottaz-Herbette & Menon, 2006; Johnston, Levin, Koval, & Everling, 2007; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Seeley et al., 2007). The spatial distribution of this network in younger persons has been observed to comprise bilateral regions of the insula and cingulate gyrus (Crottaz-Herbette & Menon, 2006; Johnston et al., 2007; Uddin, 2015). These regions were observed in this elderly cohort to be implicated in each  220  C.

However, we identiﬁed some differences between our results and previous studies (Habeck et al., 2003; Zarahn et al., 2007). Concerning additional activation not described previously, we observed, during the stimulation phase, additional activation in bilateral insula, bilateral precentral gyrus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral cuneus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, right superior parietal lobule, left postcentral gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, bilateral superior temporal gyrus and bilateral lentiform nucleus. During the retention phase, we observed supplementary activation in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral insula, left cingulate gyrus, bilateral superior parietal lobule, bilateral caudate and left superior temporal gyrus. Finally, during the probe phase we observed additional activation in bilateral cingulate gyrus, bilateral fusiform gyrus, right lentiform nucleus, bilateral dorsomesial prefrontal cortex and bilateral superior parietal lobule. An explanation could stem from differences in age and performance of the groups included in previous studies. With regard to age, studies by Habeck et al. (2003) and Zarahn et al. (2007) included subjects who were younger than those in the present study. In both these studies subjects not surprisingly performed better (response time shortened by 100–400 ms).The present study has been sufﬁciently powered to take into account age and performance effects.  We may thus hypothesize, that previously observed differences in observed activation may be largely attributable to betweenstudy heterogeneity in age and performance. The DIR task being effortless for younger persons, they may be expected to succeed and increase activation with increased difﬁculty more than older  persons. This difference in activation could be related to the concept of neural efﬁciency in both groups.  On the other hand, previous studies (Habeck et al., 2003; Zarahn et al., 2007) identiﬁed regions that we were not able to reproduce. During the stimulation phase, previous work has identiﬁed activation in the right parahippocampus; during the retention phase, activation in the bilateral precentral gyrus; during the probe phase, bilaterally in the cerebellum. This could indicate a ceiling effect for increased neural activity in relation to increasing demands of the task. That is, irrespective of difﬁculty level, older individuals may reach a maximum neural activation level, which cannot then be further increased in response to task difﬁculty.  4.2. Decreased task load effect  Previous studies assumed that, increased activation in some brain regions occurs simultaneously with attenuation of activation in other regions, in order to perform the DIR task (Griebe et al., 2014; Mayberg et al., 1999; Simpson, Drevets, Snyder, Gusnard, & Raichle, 2001a; Simpson, Drevets, Snyder, Gusnard, & Raichle, 2001b). The attenuated networks have been implicated in memory processes or interfering thoughts such as conscious awareness. Consistent with the second objective of the present study, we have identiﬁed networks with decreased activation associated with the increasing difﬁculty of the DIR task, depending on the phase of the task.  During the stimulation phase, we observed bilateral decreased activation in the middle and superior temporal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, parietal lobes, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Previous studies (Amft, Bzdok, & Laird, 2014; Bastin et al., 2012; Bluhm et al., 2011; Broyd et al., 2009; Buckner, AndrewsHanna, & Schacter, 2008; Greicius & Menon, 2004; Li, Mai, & Liu, 2014; Sambataro et al., 2010) suggested that these regions are functionally connected in the Default Mode Network (DMN).  In the present study, the spatial distribution of regions with decreased activation suggests implication of the DMN. This ﬁnding is consistent with studies in which DMN has been shown to decrease during cognitive tasks, especially during passive sensory tasks (Greicius & Menon, 2004), verbal ﬂuency tasks (Dong et al., 2012), verb generation task (Persson, Lustig, Nelson, & ReuterLorenz, 2007) or visual encoding and non-spatial working memory tasks (Rombouts et al., 2005). DMN has never been reported in a DIR task and this is the ﬁrst study to highlight DMN decreased activation simultaneously with the gradual increasing difﬁculty of a DIR task during the stimulation phase.  4.3. Relationship between increased and decreased task load effect  In brief, when the difﬁculty of the DIR task increases, we observed simultaneously increased activation in salience and central executive networks and decreased activation in DMN (Fig. 4 and Table 4). Previous studies have suggested that the salience network serves to initiate dynamic switching between the central executive network and DMN (Bressler & Menon, 2010; Habeck et al., 2005; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2012; Pochon et al., 2002).  4.4. Limitations of the present study  A limitation of the present study was our inability to explore the involvement of the cerebellum due to a limited acquisition ﬁeld. Furthermore, we analyzed increased and decreased activation associated with increasing task load on the basis of a linear model, in accordance with previous studies. However, some authors  C.

Task load related networks of the delay item recognition task. We suggest that neural networks implicated in working memory functioning in an elderly cohort are distributed in 3 distinct networks: salience and central executive networks which increased activation is associated with increasing difﬁculty of the DIR task and the default mode network which is related to task load decreased activation. Regions have been identiﬁed using Ordinal Trend Canonical Variates Analysis (OrtCVA) method and have been schematized on transverse slices (MNI space, MRIcroGL software, ch256 template). The central executive network (orange) is composed of (a) dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, (b) left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, (c) right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, (d) left parietal lobule and (e) right parietal lobule. The salience network (yellow) is composed of (f) left cingulate gyrus, (g) right cingulate gyrus, (h) left insula, (i) right insula. The default mode network (blue) is composed of (j) dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, (k) superior parietal lobule – precuneus, (l) left temporal lateral cortex, (m) right temporal lateral cortex, (n) left inferior parietal lobule and (o) right inferior parietal lobule.

Conclusion  Our results suggest that neural networks implicated in working memory functioning in an elderly cohort implicate two distinct networks: salience and central executive. Our results suggest an increased activation in salience and central executive networks and a decreased activation in DMN. Further research is required to determine whether disease-related modiﬁcations in these networks and their relation to cognitive reserve may explain the clinical differences observed between individuals.
