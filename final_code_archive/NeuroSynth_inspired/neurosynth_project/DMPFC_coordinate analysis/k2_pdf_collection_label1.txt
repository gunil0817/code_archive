To illustrate how such approaches can be used to investigate sex diﬀerences in neurocognition, we applied the multivariate technique of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to an fMRI dataset obtained during performance of mental rotation – a classic visuospatial task known to give rise to sex diﬀerences in performance. In agreement with prior results obtained using univariate methods, PCA identiﬁed a core mental rotation network (principal component [PC]1, accounting for 53.1% of total variance) that included activation of bilateral frontal, parietal, occipital and occipitotemporal regions. Expression of PC1 was similar in men and women, and was positively correlated with level of education. PC2, which accounted for 5.7% of total variance, was diﬀerentially expressed by men and women, and indicated greater mental rotation-associated neural activity in women in such highorder cortical regions such as prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule, in accord with prior ﬁndings, and with the idea that women may take a more ‘‘top-down’’ approach to mental rotation. By quantifying, in a data-driven fashion, the contribution of factors such as sex and education to patterns of brain activity, these ﬁndings put the magnitude of neural sex diﬀerences during mental rotation into perspective, conﬁrming the commonsense notion that, as humans, men and women are more alike than they are diﬀerent, with between-individual variability (such as level of education, which, importantly, is modiﬁable) generally outweighing between-sex variability. This work exempliﬁes the role that multivariate analysis can play in identifying brain functional networks, and in quantifying their involvement under speciﬁc conditions and in diﬀerent populations.

Butler et al. / Clinical Neuroscience Research 6 (2007) 391–398  Whether men and women diﬀer in their thinking styles and/or abilities is a controversial topic of great interest to neuroscientists as well to the lay public. Sex diﬀerences are also important in the context of many medical and psychiatric disorders which have a diﬀerent incidence or course depending on sex. An increasing number of functional neuroimaging studies document sex diﬀerences during the performance of various cognitive and emotional tasks (for review see [1]). Based on these studies, it is clear that participant sex must be considered when designing functional neuroimaging studies and interpreting results. What remains less clear is the precise nature and magnitude of sex eﬀects; even using a well-studied paradigm such as mental rotation [2] (a visuospatial task known to give rise to robust sex diﬀerences in performance), reported functional neuroanatomical sex diﬀerences have been variable [3–7], or absent [4,8,9], though greater frontal activity in women has been found in the majority of studies [3,6,10], including one from our group [11]. While much of this variability is likely due to diﬀerent experimental paradigms and methods of analysis, it must be acknowledged that some variability is likely due to the moderate size of the sex eﬀect, as well as to non-systematic diﬀerences in performance strategy. Certainly, as humans, men and women are more alike than they are diﬀerent, with between-individual variability (such as education levels) generally outweighing between-sex variability. It is a limitation of functional imaging studies using categorical analyses (contrasting men to women) that only those differences highly localized in space are detected.  Multivariate methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provide a means to quantify the contribution of factors such as sex to patterns of brain activity in terms of the relationship between brain regions/networks, without deciding beforehand which factors are relevant. PCA enables decomposition of a collection of three dimensional, voxel-wise condition-dependent eﬀect images of participants (be it a single group or multiple groups) into a cascade of uncorrelated component images, in descending order based on how much variation in the data is explained at each stage, where a projection direction is pursued to maximize the variation in the remaining data being expressed based on the covariance structure of the eﬀect image collection. The resulting loading scores of each component image (i.e., eigenimage or spatial mode), which deﬁne the amount of contribution to this speciﬁc component image from each participant, can then be examined against various factors of interest (such as demographic indices and clinical scores). Related analyses of resting state data by Eidelberg and associates (e.g. [12,13] and other review articles in this issue) have provided important, clinically-relevant information concerning Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders.  In the study described below, we applied PCA to an existing fMRI dataset [11,14] to examine the contribution of sex and other factors (age, education, performance accuracy, reaction time, perceived task diﬃculty) to dis tributed patterns of brain activity. We discuss aspects of PCA relevant speciﬁcally to condition-dependent activation studies, and compare PCA results to previouslyreported results [11] obtained using standard voxel-wise univariate factorial repeated-measures ANOVA. We also discuss a complementary voxel-wise measure of functional connectivity between an investigator-designated ‘‘seed’’ region and the rest of the brain, and how results obtained using such a thresholded correlational approach [15] diﬀer from those obtained using PCA and related approaches. Potential uses for network approaches to cognitive and clinical neuroscientiﬁc problems are discussed in this context.  2. Materials and methods  fMRI datasets from 25 healthy, right-handed subjects [13 women (mean age 28.6, std 7.5); 12 men (mean age 30.1, std 5.9)] were analyzed for this study, which was approved by the Weill-Cornell Institutional Review Board.  2.1. Task  Using a validated, computerized version of the classic Shepard and Metzler mental rotation task [2,16], cube ﬁgures were presented in pairs (Fig. 1). Stimuli pairs were either the same, but rotated with respect to one another (‘‘same’’ trials) or they were mirror images of each other (‘‘diﬀerent’’ trials). Stimuli were rotated by either 40°, 80°, 120° or 160°. Participants were instructed to mentally rotate ﬁgures into alignment in order to decide if they were the same or diﬀerent. Accuracy and reaction time (RT) were recorded. An active control condition consisted of pairs of ﬁgures which were either identical or mirror images which were not rotated with respect to one another. Stimuli were presented in ﬁve-trial blocks, interspersed with a resting baseline condition (visual ﬁxation). Additional details of this paradigm are available elsewhere [11,16]. After scanning, subjects completed a questionnaire about their experience and marked a 10 cm visual analog scale labeled ‘‘easy’’ and ‘‘hard’’ at each end. Average accuracy (proportion of correct responses) and reaction time for correct trials were calculated for each subject.  2.2. Image acquisition  (EPI)  ﬂip  (TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms;  Image data were acquired on one of two identical GE Signa 3 T MRI scanners (max gradient strength 40 mT/m, max gradient slew rate 150 T/m/s; General Electric Company, Waukesha, WI) using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Approximately equal numbers of men and women were scanned on each scanner. After shimming to maximize homogeneity, a series of fMRI scans was collected using gradient echo echo-planar imagangle = 70°, ing FoV = 240 mm; 27 slices; 5 mm thickness with 1 mm inter-slice space; matrix = 64 · 64). Images were acquired over the whole brain parallel to the AC–PC plane. The ﬁrst six volumes of each epoch were discarded. A reference T1 weighted anatomical image with the same slice placement and thickness and a matrix of 256 · 256 was acquired immediately preceding the EPI acquisition. This high-resolution T1 weighted anatomical image was acquired using a spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) acquisition sequence with a resolution of 0.9375 · 0.9375 · 1.5 mm3.  T.

Participants were instructed to mentally rotate pairs of ﬁgures into alignment in order to decide if they were the same or diﬀerent. This ﬁgure was taken from [11] and used with publisher’s permission.  2.3. Image processing and analysis  Image processing performed within a customized Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM99) software package (www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) included manual AC–PC re-orientation of all anatomical and EPI images; realignment of functional EPI images based on intracranial voxels to correct for slight head movement between scans; co-registration of functional EPI images to corresponding high-resolution anatomical image for each participant; stereotactic normalization to the standardized coordinate space of Talairach and Tournoux (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI average of 152 T1 brain scans) based on the high-resolution anatomical image; and spatial smoothing of the normalized EPI images with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 7.5 mm).  First, a voxel-by-voxel univariate multiple linear regression model at the participant level was employed to determine the extent to which each voxel’s activity correlated with the condition-dependent principal regressors, which consisted of stimulus onset times and duration convolved with a prototypical hemodynamic response function. The temporal global ﬂuctuation estimated as the mean intensity within brain region of each volume was removed through proportional scaling. The ﬁrst-order temporal derivative of the principal regressors, temporal global ﬂuctuation, realignment parameters, and scanning periods were incorporated as covariates of no interest. This ﬁrst level analysis resulted in a set of contrast images of condition-dependent eﬀects for each participant (including the eﬀect of each condition vs. rest and the eﬀects of between-condition comparisons), which were entered into second stage group-level analyses. These second level analyses included: (1) voxel-wise factorial repeated-measures ANOVA (previously reported in [11]); (2) block-level functional connectivity analysis through voxel-wise analysis of correlation with a functionally-deﬁned seed region (also previously reported in [11]); and (3) PCA (newly reported here).  The voxel-wise repeated-measures ANOVA focused on direct, between-group categorical comparison of females versus males using the Rotation (vs. Rest) contrast. The block-level functional  connectivity seed analysis identiﬁed brain regions that correlated with a single ‘‘seed’’ region of interest. This seed region was identiﬁed by assessing (in men and women separately) which brain regions correlated with mental rotation performance. In women, a region of dorsalmedial prefrontal cortex was most correlated with mental rotation performance. In men, a region of posterior insula (corresponding anatomically to parieto-insula vestibular cortex – PIVC) was most correlated with accurate mental rotation performance. Block-level activity in these seed regions was extracted and entered into separate multiple regression analyses for men and women to identify brain networks associated with accurate mental performance. See [11] these analyses.  for details of  For the second stage group-level PCA, three sets of PCA (within either female or male group and with all 25 participants) were carried out to examine the major spatial modes of each condition/contrast eﬀect in association with factors including education level, performance accuracy, perceived task diﬃculty level, reaction time, age and sex (the last factor was for PCA with all subjects only). For each condition/contrast, the normalized data matrix XN·M (N participants under consideration, by M voxels within the standardized brain space) of a condition-dependent eﬀect of interest (e.g. Rotate, or Rotate vs. Compare) was subject to singular value decomposition in the form of X NM ¼ U NN  SNN  V T  NM ;  where the N columns of unitary orthogonal VM·N are the resulting eigenimages (spatial modes or principal components) of the correlation matrix X T MN X NM (i.e., pair-wise/voxel-to-voxel functional connectivity matrix), SN·N is a diagonal matrix of decreasMN  X NM  V MN is a ing singular values (i.e., S2 diagonal matrix of decreasing eigenvalues) and the N columns of unitary orthogonal UN·N are the corresponding loading score vectors.

Results and discussion  3.1. Behavioral results  As reported in detail in [11], reaction times were longer and accuracy lower at higher angles of rotation, in accord with Shepard and Metzler classic ﬁndings [2], conﬁrming that subjects were appropriately engaged in the task. There were no signiﬁcant sex diﬀerences in accuracy or reaction time. Women averaged 75% correct (std 16), men 83% correct (std 17). Similar levels of behavioral performance among males and females – not unexpected given the low sample size typical of this and most functional neuroimaging studies – allow interpretation of imaging results without the confound of diﬀerential performance. The absence of behavioral sex diﬀerences can be ascribed with greater conﬁdence to low statistical power, since prior extensive behavioral testing has shown the mental rotation task used in this study to be a valid measure of mental rotation abilities which does in fact give rise to the expected male performance advantage when applied to a larger population [16]. Thus, our ﬁnding of non-signiﬁcant behavioral sex diﬀerences during fMRI scanning does not call into question the validity of the task or subjects’ engagement in the task, but instead lends support to the idea that signiﬁcant sex differences in patterns of neural activity may be due to basic diﬀerences in processing, and not solely to diﬀerential performance.  3.2. Categorical analyses (voxel-wise factorial repeated-measures ANOVA): Rotate vs. Control condition; Men and Women combined  As reported in detail in [11] and shown in Fig. 2, standard between-sex and between-condition contrast analyses showed that during mental rotation (as compared to the control condition),  Fig. 2.

Shown at z = 60 mm, voxel-wise p < 0.005.  both men and women activated bilateral prefrontal cortices, bilateral parietal (inferior and superior lobules), bilateral temporal– in agreement occipital regions and visual association cortices, with multiple prior mental rotation studies (e.g. [17,18]). See [11] for detailed results, including regions de-activated during mental rotation, which in general corresponded to a ‘‘default’’ brain network more active during rest than during most tasks [19,20].  3.3. Categorical analyses: Rotate (vs. Rest); Women vs. Men  As shown in Fig. 3a, between-sex comparisons during mental rotation revealed greater activity in women in bilateral dorsalmedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC; x =  9, y = 27, z = 51; x = 15, y = 30, z = 54) – a region strongly implicated in top-down, eﬀortful cognitive processing [21] including decision-making [22] and spatial working memory [23]. Greater frontal activity in women is in broad accord with the majority of prior functional neuroimaging studies of mental rotation demonstrating sex diﬀerences [3,6,24].  3.4. Univariate block-level ‘‘seed’’ connectivity analyses  As also reported in [11], in women, accurate mental rotation performance was signiﬁcantly correlated inversely with brain activity in left (extending to right) middle frontal gyrus (MFG). In men, the only brain region signiﬁcantly correlated with accurate performance was left posterior insula bordering on claustrum, with decreased activity associated with better performance. This posterior insula/claustrum region appears to correspond anatomically to the cortical projections of the vestibular system, referred to as parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) [25,26] and further discussed below and in [11]. The two brain regions found to be most associated with accurate performance in women and men (left MFG and left PIVC, respectively) were used as ‘‘seed’’ voxels in separate univariate functional connectivity analyses to identify brain networks diﬀerentially associated with accurate mental rotation performance in men and women. Brain regions identiﬁed as correlating positively with left MFG activity during mental rotation were similar for both men and women, and included bilateral frontal regions, bilateral angular gyri, bilateral temporal association cortices, and most prominently, bilateral posterior cingulate. In general, these regions appear to correspond to a ‘‘default’’ brain network previously shown to be active when subjects are not engaged in any particular task [19,20].  In contrast to similar MFG-correlated networks in men and women, PIVC-correlated networks diﬀered markedly by sex. In men, left PIVC inversely-correlated activity was extensive, and consisted of a large-scale network of visuospatial-related brain regions including most prominently bilateral parieto-occipital association cortex (precuneus, BA 7), as well as right temporal– occipital regions, bilateral early/primary visual cortices, and bilateral posterior parahippocampal gyrus, extending on the left to the fusiform gyrus, as shown in Fig. 4. In women, inverse correlation with activity in left PIVC was relatively sparse. Automatic evocation by men to a greater extent than women of this visual/vestibular network during mental rotation may represent an eﬀective, unconscious, ‘‘bottom-up’’ neural strategy which could reasonably account for men’s traditional visuospatial performance advantage.  T. Butler et al. / Clinical Neuroscience Research 6 (2007) 391–398  395  Fig. 3. Patterns of sex diﬀerence during mental rotation detected using between-group categorical analysis (A) and PCA (B). Categorical analysis compared Women vs. Men for the rotation vs. rest contrast. PCA was performed on the rotation vs. rest contrast with Principal Component 2 (PC2) correlating with sex. Both methods demonstrate greater dorsalmedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) activation in woman. However, PCA shows that activity in DMPFC is also associated with activity in bilateral parietal regions, and that this pattern of activity is more strongly expressed in women. Both maps show axial slice at z = 48 mm and are displayed at voxel-wise p < 0.01.  3.5. PCA using Rotation (vs. Rest) contrast images  Using Rotation contrast images (corresponding to brain areas activated during rotation as compared to rest, with one contrast image per subject), the ﬁrst principal component (PC1) was found to account for 53.11% of total variance, indicating that the mental rotation activation task induced a robust, consistent patterns of brain activity. As shown in Fig. 5a, PC1 consisted of activation of bilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA 6), bilateral/midline superior frontal gyrus, bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobules and bilateral occipital and occipitotemporal regions, with de-activation in precuneus, bilateral rostral medial frontal gyri (BA 10), bilateral posterior insula (possibly corresponding to parieto-insular vestibular cortex; PIVC), and bilateral inferior parietal lobule (more posterior to the area of activation). This pattern of results matches closely those obtained by us, as shown in Fig. 2, using standard categorical analyses, and is in accord with multiple other studies of mental rotation [17,18]. PC1 can be considered the core mental rotation brain network.  3.6. PCA using Rotation vs. Control contrast images  When the Rotation vs. Control (0° rotation) contrast images were entered into PCA, PC1 turned out to be similar but not identical, as shown in Fig. 5b. The identiﬁed network still included bilateral prefrontal, frontal and parietal regions, but with much less occipital activation, as would be expected, since level of visual stimulation was designed to be identical between activation and control condition, and was therefore subtracted out by the contrast. More interestingly, PC1 using the contrast images included more prominent bilateral insula de-activation. Given that we consider this region to be a key node in a visual–vestibular network involved in the mental rotation process [11], that would not be expected to be involved during the control comparison condition,  this ﬁnding indicates that subtracting out control activity may provide somewhat greater sensitivity for detecting speciﬁc parts of the network. However, entering between-condition contrast images into PCA must be done with caution, since the images upon which analysis is performed no longer correspond to the full set of brain regions active during a task, but to a subtraction image from which certain networks or parts of networks have been removed. It should also be noted that even entering a contrast image corresponding to the activation task versus resting constitutes a between-condition contrast insofar as the ‘‘resting state’’ is increasingly recognized to consist of a distinct pattern of activity corresponding to a default network [19,20]. Using an activation task to probe brain regions/circuits of interest serves as a ﬁlter through which brain networks speciﬁcally activated by the task (but not other aspects of the network) can be viewed.  3.7. PC1 correlation with education  PC1 correlated signiﬁcantly with the level of education (r = 0.43, p = 0.017 for rotation; r = 0.64, p = .0003 for the rotation vs. control (0°) condition, but not with any other factors. What this means is that a subject’s level of education (which ranged from 12 to 20 years) was associated with the degree to which he or she expressed the core mental-rotation-associated neural pattern. This ﬁnding will require replication using a prospective study design, but may relate to a subject’s willingness and ability to follow instructions and comply with task demands – attributes likely associated with education. Level of aptitude for mental rotation, while also shown to be associated with aspects of education [27–29] is less likely to account for this ﬁnding, because PC1 did not correlate with either mental rotation performance (r = 0.12, (r = 0.33, p > 0.05). This ﬁnding is an example of PCA’s ability to separate these factors and association.  p > 0.2) or perceived task diﬃculty  396  T.

Network of brain regions shown inverse correlation with activity in left parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC; x =  33 mm, y =  3 mm, z = 9 mm) during mental rotation in men (green) and women (red). PIVC is the region mostly correlated with performance accuracy in men. Results are displayed at a threshold of p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons over the whole brain. Note the extensive activation of parietal–occipital cortices in men, but not women. Mens’ greater use of this visual–vestibular network during mental rotation may explain their traditional performance advantage for this task. This ﬁgure was taken from [11] and used with publisher’s permission.  3.8. PC2 correlation with sex  frontal gyri  PC2, accounting for 5.74% of total variance, was signiﬁcantly diﬀerentiated according to sex (r = 0.36; p = 0.039). PC2 consisted of a pattern of activation (corresponding to greater activity in women) in bilateral/midline superior frontal gyrus/dorsalmedial prefrontal gyrus (DMPFG), bilateral right > left middle/inferior (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC), bilateral superior parietal lobule (BA 7), and left lateral occipital cortex, with de-activation (corresponding to greater activity in men) of posterior cingulate and bilateral postcentral gyri, as shown in Fig. 3b. These results, obtained in a data-driven fashion, match closely those obtained using an investigator-deﬁned categorical approach of comparing directly men and women. In particular, greater DMPFC and left lateral occipital activation in women, and greater precuneus and postcentral gyri activation in men, were detected using both approaches. The similarity of results obtained using both methods are apparent in Fig. 3. These sex diﬀerences are broadly consistent with women taking a ‘‘top down’’ approach to mental rotation, relying more upon highorder frontal regions such as DMPFC. Diﬀerences between the categorical and PCA approach include greater DLPFC activation detected using PCA. Given the role of DLPFC in eﬀortful cognitive processing and working memory, it is likely that PCA was more sensitive in detecting reliance of women upon this region. PCA also revealed bilateral superior parietal activation, which has also been reported to be greater in women than in men [7], but was not signiﬁcant using a categorical approach. The fact that PC2 – the sex-divergent pattern of activity – accounted for 5.74% of total variance, provides a framework for understanding the magnitude of neural sex diﬀerences during mental rotation.  3.9. PCA in men and women separately  While the above described PCA included both male and female subjects, and was therefore able to identify a sex-divergent pattern of activity in a data-driven manner, PCA was also examined in men and women separately. For both men and women, PC1 –  T. Butler et al. / Clinical Neuroscience Research 6 (2007) 391–398  397  Fig. 5. Principal Component 1 (PC1) – the core mental rotation network – obtained using Rotation (vs. rest) contrast images (A) and Rotation vs. Control Condition contrast images (B). Both identiﬁed networks include bilateral prefrontal, frontal and parietal regions. Less occipital activation in the rotation vs. control contrast is expected, since level of visual stimulation was designed to be identical between both conditions, and was therefore subtracted out by the contrast. See text for discussion of other diﬀerences. Maps are displayed at both z = 60 mm and z = 0 mm and thresholded at p < 0.01, uncorrected.  which consisted predominantly of bilateral cortical activation – was very similar to PC1 identiﬁed on the mixed sex group (shown in Fig. 5), as would be expected since this principal component did not correlate with sex (r =  0.0514, p = 0.6). Interestingly, PC1 in men alone correlated with perceived task diﬃculty (r = 0.62, p = 0.01), while in women alone, PC1 correlated with education (r = 0.62, p = 0.01) as well as with performance accuracy (at a trend level, r = 0.43, p = 0.07). While speculative, it may be considered that these ﬁndings ﬁt with the idea that men can perform mental rotation in a more automatic, less eﬀortful manner, with less cortical activation and greater reliance upon subcortical structures known to be involved in skill and habit learning [30] Nonautomatic, more eﬀortful mental rotation performance might be associated with greater cortical activation, as demonstrated by  the correlation of PC1 with task diﬃculty. Continued investigation and validation of these sex-speciﬁc brain networks involved in visuospatial processing can provide a method for assessing the contribution of factors such as sex hormones, psychosocial factors and genetics to network expression.  In sum, these diﬀerent approaches to the analysis of an fMRI activation paradigm provide similar, complementary results. The data-driven PCA approach provides a helpful conﬁrmatory function in this context. A key beneﬁt of PCA is the ability to truly characterize interactions among brain regions during task performance, and to quantify patterns of covariance. These data-driven patterns can be correlated with other variables or measures post hoc. PCA may provide a foundation for future use in situations where group membership is not known, and can possibly be deter 398  T. Butler et al. / Clinical Neuroscience Research 6 (2007) 391–398  mined using these techniques. By quantifying, in a data-driven fashion, the contribution of factors such as sex and education to patterns of brain activity, our PCA ﬁndings put the magnitude of neural sex diﬀerences during mental rotation into perspective, conﬁrming the commonsense notion that, as humans, men and women are more alike than they are diﬀerent, with between-individual variability (such as level of education, which, importantly, is modiﬁable) generally outweighing between-sex variability. This work exempliﬁes the role that multivariate analysis such as PCA can play in providing true network-based functional information, as well as quantifying the contribution of a given network’s activity within and across diﬀerent populations.

These negative psychiatric outcomes may reﬂect the detrimental impact of substance abuse on neural systems mediating emotion processing and executive attention. However, work indicative of this has mostly been conducted either in animal models or adults with Alcohol and/or Cannabis Use Disorder (AUD/CUD). Little work has been conducted in adolescent patients. In this study, we used the Aﬀective Stroop task to examine the relationship in 82 adolescents between AUD and/or CUD symptom severity and the functional integrity of neural systems mediating emotional processing and executive attention. We found that AUD symptom severity was positively related to amygdala responsiveness to emotional stimuli and negatively related to responsiveness within regions implicated in executive attention and response control (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus) as a function of task performance. In contrast, CUD symptom severity was unrelated to amygdala responsiveness but positively related to responsiveness within regions including precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule as a function of task performance. These data suggest diﬀerential impacts of alcohol and cannabis abuse on the adolescent brain.  1. Introduction  Two of the most commonly abused substances by adolescents in the US are alcohol and cannabis (Miech et al., 2016). Notably, epidemiological evidence suggests that adolescent alcohol users are twice as likely to develop Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) while adolescent cannabis users are over three times as likely to develop Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) by age 26 than non-users (Winters and Lee, 2008). Furthermore, adolescents who initiate substance use face a more severe disease course and a greater likelihood of relapse (Babor et al., 1992). This may reﬂect the deleterious neurodevelopmental impact of substance abuse on the adolescent brain (Filbey et al., 2015; Squeglia et al., 2015), which is undergoing critical changes at this time (Goddings et al., 2014).  One neuro-circuitry undergoing development during adolescence that  may be disrupted by substance abuse is the neuro-circuitry mediating emotional processing (Koob and Volkow, 2016). Animal work suggests that substance dependence leads to decreased striatal response to reward and increased amygdala responsiveness to stress (Koob and Volkow, 2016). In line with this, there have been reports of increased amygdala responses to negative images in alcohol dependent adults relative to controls (Gilman and Hommer, 2008), and in undergraduate students who also demonstrated relatively low ventral striatal responsiveness to reward (Nikolova et al., 2016). Additionally, there has been at least one report of increased amygdala responsiveness to angry relative to neutral faces in adolescents with mild cannabis use histories (group average: < 5 times lifetime usage) (Spechler et al., 2015). However, other work has reported reduced amygdala responses to emotional relative to neutral faces in alcohol dependent adults (O'Daly et al., 2012) and in adult heavy cannabis smokers relative to healthy control adults (Gruber et al., 2010). In short, the human fMRI  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Center for Neurobehavioral Research, Boys Town National Research Hospital, 14100 Crawford Street, Boys Town, NE 68010, United States.

NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  literature is somewhat inconsistent and focused on studies with adult participants.  A second putative neuro-circuitry disrupted by substance abuse is that mediating behavioral inhibition (Feldstein Ewing et al., 2014; Silveri et al., 2016; Spear, 2016); i.e., anterior cingulate/dorsomedial prefrontal cortices (ACC/dmPFC) and anterior insular cortex/inferior frontal gyrus (aIC/iFG; Criaud and Boulinguez, 2013). Moreover, substance abuse may also disrupt regions showing dense projections with ACC/dmPFC (i.e. dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and parietal cortices) which are critical for executive attention (Desimone and Duncan, 1995; Squire et al., 2013). Neuroimaging work has revealed that, relative to controls, undergraduate students and adults with heavy alcohol use histories show reduced ACC responses during NoGo trials relative to baseline (Ahmadi et al., 2013; Claus et al., 2013) and reduced dlPFC responses during successful, relative to unsuccessful, Stop trials during a Stop Signal Task (Li et al., 2009). Furthermore, ACC functional connectivity has been identiﬁed as a predictor of relapse in adults aged 18–50 with AUD (Zakiniaeiz et al., 2017). The literature in adolescents aged 18 and younger has been more mixed. One study reported an inverse relationship between prior alcohol consumption and aIC responses to incongruent relative to congruent trials during a Stroop task (Thayer et al., 2015). Another study which tracked youths from early to late adolescence reported that adolescents (ages 11–17) who later transitioned into heavy drinking showed decreased activity within middle frontal and parietal cortices in NoGo relative to Go trials prior to the onset of heavy drinking compared to controls who did not transition into heavy drinking (Norman et al., 2011; Wetherill et al., 2014). At a three-year follow-up after the onset of heavy drinking (at ages 14–21), adolescents who did transition to heavy drinking showed increased BOLD responses in these contrasts and brain regions relative to their baseline scans. However, participants who did not transition to heavy drinking showed decreased BOLD responses in these contrasts and brain regions relative to their baseline scans (Wetherill et al., 2014).  The empirical literature suggests a rather diﬀerent relationship between cannabis usage and brain regions implicated in behavioral inhibition or executive attention, speciﬁcally increased (potentially compensatory) recruitment of these regions. In a Stroop task, adults with histories of heavy cannabis use showed increased ACC and dlPFC activity during interference trials relative to controls (Gruber and Yurgelun-Todd, 2005). Additionally, in a Multi-Source Interference Task, adults with histories of chronic cannabis smoking showed increased ACC recruitment during interference trials relative to control trials compared to healthy control subjects (Gruber et al., 2013). Furthermore, Filbey and Yezhuvath (2013) showed that cannabis-dependent adults showed greater connectivity between right frontal cortex and the substantia nigra/subthalamic nucleus network during successful inhibition on a Stop Signal task compared to non-dependent cannabis using adults. In a sample of adolescents, marijuana users showed increased recruitment of executive attention regions during NoGo trials relative to baseline in a Go-NoGo task (Tapert et al., 2008). Dysfunction in executive attention neuro-circuitry may be related to increased amygdala responsiveness to threat in patients with substance abuse. Executive attention neuro-circuitry involves the dlPFC and parietal cortices and allows the priming of task-relevant representations at the expense of irrelevant ones (Desimone and Duncan, 1995). This increased priming of task-relevant stimuli inhibits the representation of emotional distractors and results in reduced amygdala responses to these distractors (Blair et al., 2007). Executive attention can be recruited explicitly within cognitive reappraisal emotion regulation paradigms (Ochsner and Gross, 2005) but also implicitly through emotion distraction paradigms (Erthal et al., 2005). Both executive attention and emotional responsiveness systems are implicated in exteroception, or processing self-relevant external stimuli, and is thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of substance abuse (DeWitt et al., 2015). If alcohol and/or cannabis abuse compromise task-relevant executive attention,  then representation of external  stimuli should be impaired, resulting in compromised emotion regulation and increased emotional responsiveness. Alternatively, alcohol and/or cannabis abuse may compromise neural systems underlying exteroception relatively independently, resulting in reduced representation of task-relevant stimuli regardless of emotional stimuli and/or increased emotional responsiveness regardless of task demands. In the current study, we implemented an emotion distraction task, the Aﬀective Stroop task (aST; Blair et al., 2007) in adolescents showing varying levels of AUD and CUD symptomatology. In the aST, participants are instructed to determine the quantity of numbers displayed on the screen that are temporally bracketed by either emotional or neutral distracters. Work with healthy adolescents (Hwang et al., 2014) and adults (Blair et al., 2007) reveals that task performance is associated with decreased amygdala responsiveness to emotional distracters and increased recruitment of regions mediating behavioral inhibition (ACC, dmPFC, aIC, and iFG) and executive attention (dlPFC and parietal cortices) to task-relevant stimuli. The aST has been extensively used in work with both adolescent and adult clinical populations (Blair et al., 2013, 2012; Hwang et al., 2016, 2015; White et al., 2014). Speciﬁcally, adults with GAD, SAD, and PTSD show compromised recruitment of ACC and/or parietal cortices during task relative to view trials (Blair et al., 2013, 2012) while adolescents with ADHD, show reduced dmPFC activity during incongruent trials relative to typically developing (TD) adolescents (Hwang et al., 2015). Furthermore, in adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs), there is decreased recruitment of aIC in incongruent relative to view trials and the degree to which this is compromised relates to impulsivity symptoms within this sample (Hwang et al., 2016). In addition, adolescents with DBDs and high levels of callous-unemotional traits showed reduced vmPFC and amygdala responsiveness to negatively valenced stimuli (Hwang et al., 2016). In short, the aST has been successfully used to show dysfunction in emotion processing, behavioral inhibition, and executive attention neuro-circuitries in adult and adolescent clinical populations.  We hypothesized that: (i) participants with high levels of AUD and CUD symptoms would show increased recruitment of the region implicated in emotional responding to both positively and negatively valenced stimuli (amygdala); and (ii) participants with at least high levels of AUD symptomatology would show reduced recruitment of regions implicated in behavioral inhibition (dmPFC/ACC and/or aIC/ iFG) and/or executive (dlPFC and/or parietal cortices) to task relative to view trials.  2. Materials and methods  2.1. Participants  Study participants included 96 youths aged 14–18 years from both a residential treatment facility and the community. 14 participants were excluded due to excessive movement (> 10% volumes censored at > 1 mm motion across adjacent volumes) or low accuracy on the task (< 60% accuracy; average AUDIT of excluded participants = 4.2, average CUDIT of excluded participants = 5.0). This resulted in a ﬁnal sample of 82 youths (47 youths from the residential treatment facility and 35 from the community); average age = 16.1 (SD = 1.32), IQ = 100.6 (SD = 10.13) and 51 male. Clinical characterization was done through psychiatric interviews by licensed and board-certiﬁed psychiatrists with the participants and their parents. Youths with signiﬁcant substance abuse histories were residents of the residential treatment facility and were abstinent for at least four weeks prior to scanning.  49 youths endorsed having used, and 33 youths denied having used, alcohol and/or cannabis on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identiﬁcation Test (AUDIT) and the Cannabis Use Disorder Identiﬁcation Test (CUDIT), respectively (Adamson et al., 2010; Fairlie et al., 2006; Saunders et al., 1993). The range of AUDIT scores and CUDIT scores was 0–22 (M = 2.9; SD = 4.65) and 0–32 (M = 7.0; SD = 8.96), respectively. AUDIT scores, but not CUDIT scores, were signiﬁcantly related with age  783  J.

[AUDIT: r = 0.26, p = 0.02; CUDIT: r = 0.19, ns] while neither AUDIT nor CUDIT scores were signiﬁcantly related to IQ [AUDIT: r = −0.118, ns; CUDIT: r = −0.159, ns]. There were no diﬀerences in AUDIT or CUDIT scores between males and females [AUDIT: t(80) = −0.76, ns; CUDIT: t(80) = 1.09, ns].  Of the youths endorsing alcohol and/or cannabis use during their lifetimes, 14 youths showed subclinical levels of alcohol and/or cannabis use while 35 met the clinical cutoﬀs on the AUDIT and/or CUDIT suggestive of adolescent AUD (AUDIT score ≥ 4) or CUD (CUDIT score ≥ 8), respectively (Adamson et al., 2010; Fairlie et al., 2006). 21 participants had an AUDIT score ≥ 4 and 29 participants had a CUDIT score ≥ 8. In line with previous work indicating the high comorbidity of AUD and CUD (Mason et al., 2013; Moss et al., 2014), 15 participants had both an AUDIT score ≥ 4 and CUDIT score ≥ 8.  Exclusion criteria included pervasive developmental disorder, Tourette's syndrome, lifetime history of psychosis, neurological disorder, head trauma, and non-psychiatric medical illnesses requiring medications that may have psychotropic eﬀects (e.g. beta-blockers, steroids), and IQ < 75. The Institutional Review Board at Boys Town National Research Hospital approved the study procedures and informed assent/consent was obtained from all participants and their parents or legal guardians.  2.2. Measures  2.2.1. Aﬀective Stroop task (aST)  An adapted version of the Aﬀective Stroop task (Blair et al., 2007)  was administered during fMRI scanning (see Fig. 1). The emotional stimuli consisted of 16 negative, 16 neutral, and 16 positive pictures selected from the International Aﬀective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 1988). The mean valence and arousal values on a 9-point scale, respectively, were 3.2 (SD = 0.71) and 1.7 (SD = 0.28) for negative images; 4.9 (SD = 0.30) and 1.1 (SD = 0.22) for neutral images; and 7.4 (SD = 0.47) and 1.61 (SD = 0.31) for positive images. The individual cognitive task stimuli consisted of displays of numbers and the cognitive task involved deciding how many numbers were displayed in each display (see Fig. 1 for example stimuli). Speciﬁcally, subjects pressed button 3, 4, 5, or 6 to indicate whether there were 3, 4, 5, or 6 numbers in the display.  Each trial began with a ﬁxation point presented in the middle of the screen. For the number trials, the ﬁxation point was replaced by the ﬁrst picture stimuli presented for 400 ms, followed by the numerical display presented for 400 ms, followed by the second picture display presented for 400 ms, followed by a blank stimulus for 1300 (see Fig. 1). On incongruent trials, the Arabic numeral distracter information was inconsistent with the numerosity information (e.g., four 3s; Fig. 1A). On congruent trials, the Arabic numeral distracter information was consistent with the numerosity information; (e.g., three 3s; Fig. 1B). For view trials, there was no numerical display; the numerical display was replaced by a ﬁxation point (see Fig. 1C). Participants completed two identical runs of the task. In each run, each subject was presented with 16 trials of each of the 9 emotion-by-task conditions. This resulted in 288 total trials. In addition, 40 ﬁxation points (staying on the screen for the duration of a condition trial 2500 ms) were  784  J. Aloi et al.  Table 1 Clinical and demographic characteristics.

Thus, overall each subject was presented with 32 trials of each of the 9 emotion-by-task conditions resulting in 288 total trials.  2.2.2. Substance use disorder assessments  Youths completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identiﬁcation Test (AUDIT) and Cannabis Use Disorder Identiﬁcation Test (CUDIT). These scales assess overall alcohol/cannabis consumption over the past year as well as symptoms of alcohol/cannabis abuse and dependence. These scales show high validity, as elevated scores on these scales indicate a high probability of a AUD and/or CUD diagnosis (Adamson et al., 2010; Fairlie et al., 2006; Saunders et al., 1993). Smoking status was determined using the Monitoring the Future Survey (Miech et al., 2016). As can be seen in Table 1, participants meeting clinical cut-oﬀs on the AUDIT/CUDIT endorsed regular past smoking while sub-clinical levels of AUDIT/CUDIT symptomatology were associated with rare past usage. Most participants with no AUDIT/CUDIT symptomatology endorsed no prior smoking history.  2.2.3. Psychiatric symptomatology assessments  In order to provide more details on psychiatric co-morbidities, levels of externalizing, anxiety, and depressive symptomatology were assessed. The externalizing problems subscale of the parent-report version of the Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess externalizing behaviors (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001). The self-report version of the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARED) was used to assess levels of anxiety symptoms (Birmaher et al., 1997). The self-report version of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) was used to assess levels of depressive symptoms (Angold et al., 1995).  NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  2.3. Scanning parameters  Whole-brain blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data were acquired using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Skyra Magnetic Resonance Scanner. A total of 384 functional images were taken, divided over two runs, with a T2* weighted gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (repetition time = 2500 ms; echo time = 27 ms, 94 × 94 matrix; 90° ﬂip angle; 240 mm ﬁeld of view). Whole-brain coverage was obtained with 43 axial slices (thickness, 2.5 mm; voxel size 2.6 × 2.6 × 2.5 mm3). In the same session, a high-resolution T1 anatomical scan (MP-RAGE, repetition time = 2200 ms, echo time = 2.48 ms; 230 mm ﬁeld of view; 8° ﬂip angle; 256 × 208 matrix) was acquired in register with the EPI dataset. Whole-brain coverage was obtained with 176 axial slices (thickness, 1 mm; voxel size 0.9 × 0.9 × 1 mm3).  2.4. fMRI analysis: data preprocessing and individual level analysis  Functional MRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software (Cox, 1996). The ﬁrst four volumes in each scan were discarded. The anatomical scan for each participant was registered to the Talairach and Tournoux atlas (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) using the TT_N27 template and each participant's functional EPI data were registered to their Talairach anatomical scan in AFNI. Functional images were motion corrected and spatially smoothed with a 6-mm full width half maximum Gaussian kernel. The data then underwent time series normalization by dividing the signal intensity of a voxel at each time-point by the mean signal intensity of that voxel for each run and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the resultant regression coeﬃcients are representative of a percentage of signal change from the mean.  Afterward, regressors were generated by convolving the train of stimulus events with a gamma variate hemodynamic response function to account for the slow hemodynamic response. The ten regressors were: (i) positive images, incongruent numerosity; (ii) positive images, congruent numerosity; (iii) positive images, view; (iv) neutral images, incongruent numerosity; (v) neutral images, congruent numerosity; (vi) neutral images, view; (vii) negative images, incongruent numerosity; (viii) negative images, congruent numerosity; (ix) negative images, view; (x) missed/incorrect responses. GLM ﬁtting was performed with these ten regressors, six regressors modeling motion, and a regressor modeling a ﬁrst-order baseline drift function. This produced a β coefﬁcient and an associated t-statistic for each voxel and regressor.  2.5. fMRI analysis: group analysis  To reduce skewness and kurtosis, a Blom Transformation was applied to the participants' AUDIT and CUDIT scores. This is a normalization procedure which ranks orders, and then standardizes values within a dataset (Blom, 1958). The pre-transformation skewness values for AUDIT and CUDIT scores were 2.4 and 1.1, respectively. Posttransformation, the skewness values were 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. The pre-transformation kurtosis values for AUDIT and CUDIT scores were 6.4 and 0.3, respectively. Post-transformation, the kurtosis values were −0.4 and −0.6, respectively. The Blom-Transformed standardized AUDIT and CUDIT scores were used for all analyses. For the group-level analyses, a 3 (Emotion: Positive, Neutral, Negative) × 3 (Task Condition: Incongruent, Congruent, View) repeated measures ANCOVA with AUDIT and CUDIT scores as continuous covariates was performed on the BOLD data within a grey matter mask created in AFNI. Follow-up testing was performed within SPSS 22.0 and freely available online tools (Lee and Preacher, 2013). For signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-emotion interactions, Steiger Z-tests were used to compare the partial correlations between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses (controlling for CUDIT scores and AUDIT-by-CUDIT interactions) in the positive trials, neutral trials, and negative trials (Steiger, 1980). A similar procedure was used for any signiﬁcant CUDIT-by-emotion, AUDIT-by-task condition, and  785  J. Aloi et al.

For four-way interactions, a bootstrapping procedure using the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Preacher and Hayes, 2004) was used to examine how CUD symptomatology moderated the eﬀect of AUD symptomatology on BOLD response within each of the 9 emotion-by-task condition trial types. For these follow-up tests, the AUDIT-by-CUDIT interaction term was considered signiﬁcant at a threshold of p = 0.05, Bonferroni corrected. For each trial type that was identiﬁed as signiﬁcant, the Johnson-Neyman technique was used to investigate heterogeneity of the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses at diﬀerent levels of CUDIT scores (Kowalski et al., 1994). The Johnson-Neyman technique identiﬁes speciﬁc regions of interest within the distribution of CUDIT scores where the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses was signiﬁcant. The Johnson-Neyman technique was used to probe these interactions because it provides information regarding the nature of the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses across the entire distribution of CUDIT scores (Kowalski et al., 1994). To facilitate future metaanalytic work, eﬀect sizes (Partial η2) for all clusters are reported.  The AFNI 3dClustSim program, using the autocorrelation function (-acf), was used to establish a family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons for the amygdala ROI and whole-brain analysis (Cox et al., 2017). Spatial autocorrelation was estimated from residuals from the individual-level GLMs. Given our a priori hypotheses regarding the amygdala, regions of interest (ROIs) for left and right amygdala were speciﬁed as anatomically deﬁned masks (Eickhoﬀ-Zilles Architectonic Atlas 50% probability mask; Amunts et al., 2005). This yielded a threshold of 5 voxels at an initial threshold of p = 0.02 for the amygdala ROI. The whole-brain analysis yielded a threshold of 19 voxels at an initial threshold of p = 0.001. Post-hoc analyses were conducted on the percent signal change taken from all signiﬁcant voxels within each ROI and whole-brain functional masks generated by AFNI to examine signiﬁcant main eﬀects and interactions with planned follow-up testing within SPSS 22.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics For MacOSX, 2012).  3. Results  3.1. Clinical relationships  Correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relationships between AUD, CUD and psychiatric symptom levels dimensionally. These revealed positive correlations between AUDIT and CUDIT scores [r = 0.63, p < 0.001] and AUDIT scores and levels of externalizing problems (CBCL externalizing T-score), anxiety (SCARED total score) and depressive symptoms (MFQ) [r's = 0.27–0.33, p's < 0.05]. CUDIT scores were positively correlated with level of externalizing problems [r = 0.39, p = 0.001], and with level of anxiety symptoms and level of  786  depressive symptoms at trend levels [r's = 0.19–0.192, p's < 0.10]. Additionally, both AUDIT scores and CUDIT scores were positively related to level of smoking [r's = 0.65 and 0.70, respectively; p's < 0.001]. Importantly, there were no diﬀerential correlations between AUDIT and CUDIT scores and levels of externalizing problems, anxiety symptoms, or depressive symptoms [Steiger's Z's = 0.70–1.18, ns]. There were also no diﬀerential correlations between AUDIT and CUDIT scores and level of smoking [Steiger Z = 0.71, ns]. Ten participants had missing data for the CBCL, six had missing data for the SCARED, and two each had missing MFQ and smoking data. There were no diﬀerences in AUDIT scores or CUDIT scores between participants who were missing data on the CBCL, SCARED, MFQ, and/or smoking data and those who were not missing these data [t's < 1.36, ns]. See Tables 1 and 2 for more details.  3.2. Behavioral results  Two 3 (Emotion: Positive, Neutral, Negative) × 2 (Task Condition: Incongruent, Congruent) repeated measures ANCOVAs using the normalized Blom-Transformed AUDIT and CUDIT scores as continuous covariates were conducted on the aST accuracy and reaction time (RT) data. Accuracy on the aST ranged from 60% to 99%. There was a main eﬀect of task condition, [F(1,78) = 33.49, p < 0.001]; participants were less accurate on incongruent trials [M = 81.33%, SD = 14.61%] relative to congruent trials [M = 86.93%, SD = 10.04%]. The emotion main eﬀect, covariate-by-emotion interaction eﬀects, and covariate-bytask condition interaction eﬀects were not signiﬁcant.  With respect to RT, there was again a main eﬀect of task condition [F(1,78) = 167.33, p < 0.001]; participants responded slower on incongruent trials [M = 854.96, SD = 200.89] than congruent trials [M = 787.52, SD = 207.56]. The emotion main eﬀect, covariate-byemotion interaction eﬀects, and covariate-by-task condition interaction eﬀects were not signiﬁcant.  3.3. Movement data  Fourteen participants were excluded due to excessive motion or low accuracy on the task. Within the ﬁnal sample (N = 82), volumes were censored if there was > 1 mm motion across adjacent volumes. No participant in the ﬁnal sample for the current study had > 5% censored volumes. There were no relationships between either AUDIT scores or CUDIT scores and censored volumes, average motion per volume, or maximum displacement during scanning within the ﬁnal sample [r's = −0.10–0.20, ns].  J. Aloi et al.  3.4. fMRI results  The goal of the current study was to examine whether level of adolescent AUD and CUD symptomatology was related to dysfunction in brain regions associated with emotional responding and executive attention. We ran a 3 (Emotion: Positive, Neutral, Negative) by 3 (Task Condition: Incongruent, Congruent, View) repeated measures ANCOVA with the Blom-Transformed standardized AUDIT and CUDIT scores as continuous covariates on the BOLD response data. This revealed regions showing AUDIT-by-emotion, AUDIT-by-task condition, CUDIT-by-task condition and AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-emotion-by-task condition interactions. Regions showing main eﬀects of emotion and task and emotionby-tasks interaction are reported in the Supplemental material (Table S1). No regions showed signiﬁcant AUDIT main eﬀects, CUDIT main eﬀects, or AUDIT-by-CUDIT interactions. No regions showed signiﬁcant CUDIT-by-emotion, AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-emotion, AUDIT-by-CUDITby-task condition, AUDIT-by-emotion-by-task condition, or CUDIT-byemotion-by task condition interactions:  3.4.1. Amygdala ROI 3.4.1.1. AUDIT-by-emotion interaction. There was a signiﬁcant AUDITby-emotion interaction within the right amygdala (Fig. 2). With increasing AUDIT scores, there were increasing BOLD responses for positive relative to both neutral and negative stimuli [Steiger's Z's = 3.37 & 2.30, p < 0.001 & p < 0.05 respectively]. The ROI analysis revealed no signiﬁcant CUDIT-by-emotion interactions. The  NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-Emotion interaction within this cluster was not signiﬁcant, indicating that the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses was consistent across all CUDIT scores.  condition  interaction. 3.4.1.2. AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-emotion-by-task There was a four-way interaction in the left amygdala ROI (Fig. 2). Utilizing a bootstrapping procedure for the moderation analysis, it was found that there was a signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-CUDIT interaction eﬀect in negative view trials. Using the Johnson-Neyman technique, it was found that there was a negative relationship between AUDIT scores and activation low CUD there was a positive symptomatology (CUDIT = 0).

Whole-brain analysis 3.4.2.1. AUDIT-by-task condition interaction. There were signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-task condition interactions within regions including dlPFC, iFG, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), ACC, dmPFC, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; Fig. 3, Table 3). These regions overlapped with regions involved in the main eﬀect of task condition (Table S1). In all but one region of dlPFC, BOLD responses were greater to task relative to view trials. Additionally, within ACC and dmPFC, BOLD responses were also greater to incongruent relative to congruent trials. Within all of increased AUDIT scores were associated with decreased activation for incongruent relative to  these regions,  Fig. 2.

As can be seen in Fig. 3, these data reﬂected decreasing responses during incongruent trials as a function of increasing levels of AUD symptomatology. None of these clusters revealed a signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-Task Condition interaction, indicating that the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses were consistent across the entire distribution of CUDIT scores.  3.4.2.2. CUDIT-by-task condition interaction. There were signiﬁcant CUDIT-by-task condition interactions within regions including PCC, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule (iPL; Fig. 3, Table 3). These regions overlapped with regions involved in the main eﬀect of task condition (Table S1). Within all of these regions, BOLD responses were greater to task relative to view trials. In these regions, as CUDIT scores increased, there was increased activation for incongruent relative to congruent [Steiger's Z's = 2.84–3.98, p's < 0.005] and view trials [Steiger's Z's = 3.25–4.54, p's < 0.001]. As can be seen in Fig. 3, these data reﬂected both increasing responses during incongruent trials and decreasing responses during view trials as a function of increasing  levels of CUD symptomatology. None of these clusters revealed a signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-Task Condition interaction, indicating that the relationship between AUDIT scores and BOLD responses were consistent across the entire distribution of CUDIT scores.  condition  interaction. 3.4.2.3. AUDIT-by-CUDIT-by-emotion-by-task There was a signiﬁcant four-way interaction eﬀect in the left iFG (Table 3). Notably, a bootstrapping procedure for the moderation analysis revealed a signiﬁcant AUDIT-by-CUDIT interaction eﬀect for negative view trials; AUDIT scores were negatively associated with activation at lower CUD symptom levels (CUDIT < 4) but positively associated at high CUD symptom levels (CUDIT > 27).  3.5. Potential confounds  Since age was related to AUDIT scores, the same analysis was repeated with age as a covariate (Table S2). In addition, calculation of Mahalanobis Distance for each participant revealed four multivariate outliers within the dataset. Therefore, the same analysis was repeated with these participants removed from the dataset (Table S3). Since there is evidence that males and females may be diﬀerentially aﬀected by alcohol and cannabis (Caldwell et al., 2005; Ketcherside et al., 2016;  788  J. Aloi et al.

Peters et al., 2015), the same analysis was repeated with gender was entered as a covariate (Table S4). To rule out the possibility that smoking may have inﬂuenced our results, the same analysis was repeated with participants who endorsed current smoking excluded (Table S5). To rule out the possibility that over-representation of 0 for AUDIT and CUDIT scores biased our results, we re-ran the analysis in only individuals who reported alcohol and/or cannabis use (Table S6). All of these analyses yielded similar results (see Supplementary results; Tables S2–S6).  4. Discussion  This study examined the relationships between AUD and CUD severity and dysfunction in emotional and executive attention neurocircuitry in adolescents. There were three main ﬁndings. First, increasing AUD, but not CUD, severity was associated with increasing amygdala responses to emotional relative to neutral stimuli. Second, increasing AUD severity was associated with decreasing levels of recruitment of regions implicated in executive attention for task relative to view trials. Third, increasing CUD severity was associated with increasing BOLD responses within PCC, precuneus, and iPL during task relative to view trials.  In line with our predictions, increasing severity of AUD symptomatology was associated with increasing amygdala responsiveness to emotional relative to neutral stimuli. This was seen for increasing AUD severity when responding to negative view trials if CUD symptomatology was high and for positive trials irrespective of task condition or level of CUD symptomatology. Previous work has suggested that chronic alcohol use leads to an increased stress response and hyperresponsiveness of the amygdala to threat stimuli (Koob and Volkow, 2016; Volkow et al., 2016). Thus, previous fMRI work has revealed that adults with alcohol dependence show increased amygdala responses to  threat (Gilman and Hommer, 2008) and that increased amygdala threat responsiveness is a risk factor for the development of alcohol abuse in college students – at least for those showing reward hyporesponsiveness (Nikolova et al., 2016). However, no previous work has investigated amygdala responsiveness to threat or (non-alcohol cue) positive stimuli in adolescents with alcohol abuse histories. The current data complements the earlier work by indicating threat hyper-responsiveness in adolescents as a function of AUD severity (at least for those with relatively high levels of CUD) and extends this earlier work by indicating elevated responsiveness to positive stimuli as a function of AUD severity also. The AUDIT-by-Emotion amygdala interaction is right lateralized. Lateralized amygdala ﬁndings are not uncommon in the literature though their interpretation remains speculative. A meta-analytic review of the data found evidence of a relative left amygdala lateralization for stimuli containing language and a relative right-lateralization for masked stimuli (Costafreda et al., 2008). This prompted the suggestion that the right amygdala might play a greater role in initial stimulus detection (Costafreda et al., 2008). On this basis, it could be suggested that adolescents with high levels of AUD symptoms are particularly responsive to the initial detection of emotional stimuli. However, this speculation goes considerably beyond the data.  It should be noted that severity of CUD symptomatology was not related to amygdala responsiveness to emotional stimuli. If this result replicates, models assuming that substance abuse generally leads to increased amygdala responsiveness (Koob and Volkow, 2016; Volkow et al., 2016) may need adjustment for adolescent substance use. The current data imply that correlates of AUD symptomatology diﬀer from those of CUD symptomatology in adolescents and that it is only alcohol abuse that leads to exaggerated amygdala responsiveness. The current ﬁndings are inconsistent with those of Spechler et al. (2015) who reported that adolescents with cannabis use histories show increased amygdala sensitivity to angry faces (Spechler et al., 2015). However,  789  J. Aloi et al.  NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  the Spechler et al. study involved adolescents who mostly reported very low levels of cannabis use (49/70 cannabis users endorsed only using marijuana once or twice in their lives). Moreover, the current study diﬀered from that of Spechler et al. with respect to psychiatric comorbidity. It could be argued that the psychiatric co-morbidity camouﬂaged any relationship between CUD symptomatology and amygdala responsiveness. However, it should be noted that this was not the case with respect to AUD symptomatology and amygdala responsiveness (yet psychiatric co-morbidity was comparably related to AUDIT scores as CUDIT scores).  In line with predictions, increasing severity of AUD symptomatology was associated with reduced recruitment of ACC/dmPFC and iFG for incongruent relative to both congruent and view trials. Both ACC/ dmPFC and iFG have been implicated in behavioral inhibition (Criaud and Boulinguez, 2013). Moreover, animal work has suggested that adolescent alcohol use is related to disrupted prefrontal cortex development and deﬁcits in response inhibition during adulthood (Gass et al., 2014; Irimia et al., 2015; Spear, 2016) while human neuro-psychological work has revealed impairment on measures of behavioral inhibition in adults with AUD (Czapla et al., 2016). The current data suggest that increasing levels of alcohol abuse are associated, even in adolescence, with compromised recruitments of regions implicated in behavioral inhibition (even though increasing AUDIT scores were not related to behavioral performance on the current task).  Additionally, the ACC/dmPFC contains dense projections to and from brain regions involved in executive attention, such as dlPFC and iPL (Desimone and Duncan, 1995). The current study showed that increasing AUD symptomatology was associated with decreasing recruitment of dlPFC and iPL for incongruent relative to congruent and congruent relative to view trials. This is consistent with prior work showing reduced activity in these brain regions in adults (Ahmadi et al., 2013; Claus et al., 2013; Li et al., 2009) and youths (Thayer et al., 2015) with alcohol use histories. Notably, though, within the context of the aST, activity in these brain regions is thought to reﬂect a putative role in priming task-relevant stimuli and consequent decreased representation of and responsiveness to emotional stimuli; i.e., emotional regulation (Blair et al., 2007). In short, the ﬁndings of a negative relationship between response inhibition and executive attention neurocircuitries and AUD symptoms, when combined with the positive relationship between amygdala responsiveness to emotional stimuli and AUD symptoms, might at least partly reﬂect the compromised functioning of this form of emotional regulation. It should be noted, however, that there was no evidence of any AUDIT-by-Emotion-by-Task Condition interactions; i.e., there were no indications of a failure to reduce emotional responsiveness as a function of AUD severity during negative task trials. Instead, AUD severity was associated with increased responsiveness across emotion conditions and might be particularly increased in negative view trials within IFG. As such, we assume that AUD severity is associated with increased emotional responsiveness that is independent of any failure in executive attention mediated emotional regulation.  Our third main ﬁnding was that increasing CUDIT scores were related to increasing activity within PCC, precuneus, and iPL during task relative to view trials. There have been suggestions that substance abuse, particularly cannabis abuse, may lead to increased prefrontal ineﬃciency; i.e., substance abuse may lead to compromised functioning of speciﬁc regions such that these regions need to be activated more strongly in order to produce successful task performance (Gruber et al., 2013; Luijten et al., 2014; Tapert et al., 2008). There have also been suggestions that patients with other psychiatric conditions also show indications of prefrontal ineﬃciency (Mitterschiﬀthaler et al., 2008; Wagner et al., 2006). In the current study, we saw clear indications of disruption in the functioning of frontal cortex particularly as a result of severity of AUD. However, increasing severity of AUD was associated with decreasing responsiveness within regions including dlPFC, iFG, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), ACC and dmPFC; i.e., increasing AUD  severity was associated with a decreased ability to recruit these regions rather than revealing increasing, compensatory activity. In contrast, increasing CUD symptom severity was associated with increasing responsiveness within PCC, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule in response to task trials; all regions implicated in responding to task trials. As such, these data might indicate a form of posterior attentional system ineﬃciency relating to CUD severity. Increasing CUD severity may have required participants to show stronger activation of these regions for successful task performance. While a compensatory account might explain the data of the current study, it is unclear why higher levels of CUD symptomatology would be associated with compensation while higher levels of AUD symptomatology would be associated with disrupted functioning (particularly when neither level of symptomatology related to behavioral performance). Alternatively, increased activity in the PCC and precuneus could reﬂect a failure of the default mode network to fully deactivate during task trials. This might reﬂect diﬀerences in concentration as a function of substance use and task diﬃculty (anonymous reviewer's suggestion). However, only these regions within the default mode network showed this eﬀect. Even at more lenient thresholds (initial p = 0.005, k = 10 voxels), no signiﬁcant clusters emerged within other regions implicated in the default mode network. It is unclear why diﬀerences in concentration would have selective eﬀects within the default mode network.  The results of this study must be viewed in light of ﬁve caveats. First, we did not conduct urine or Breathalyzer testing for substance use at the time of scanning. However, youths with signiﬁcant substance abuse histories were residents of a highly supervised residential treatment facility and had been abstinent for at least four weeks prior to scanning, mitigating this concern. Another signiﬁcant caveat is that this study was cross-sectional in nature. As such, it is not possible to be certain whether the observed relationships between levels of AUD and CUD symptomatology and brain function reﬂected impact of substance abuse on the developing brain or pre-existing risk factors for the emergence of symptomatology. Animal and longitudinal neuroimaging work has shown that alcohol and cannabis use alter neurodevelopment (Spear, 2016; Squeglia et al., 2015). However, dysfunction in behavioral inhibition/top-down attention systems is also predictive of later problematic substance use (Norman et al., 2011). One reason to believe that the current results are more reﬂective of the impact of AUD/CUD on the developing brain is that there were diﬀerential relationships between AUD and CUD symptomatology on brain function. It is not clear that there are pre-existing neural risk factors that place the individual at risk speciﬁcally for AUD rather than CUD. However, future longitudinal work would need to conﬁrm this suggestion. Third, the sample investigated here reﬂected clinical reality; i.e., there was a high degree of psychiatric co-morbidity in the participants that was particularly marked in those participants scoring high on the AUDIT/CUDIT. As such, the ﬁndings presented here might reﬂect psychopathology related to the co-morbid conditions rather than AUD/CUD symptomatology. It would be possible to test participants without co-morbid pathology. However, this would mean investigating a clinically atypical sample. Moreover, increasing substance abuse is hypothesized to compromise functions associated with the emergence of many of these psychiatric conditions (Koob and Volkow, 2016; Volkow et al., 2016). Critically though, and mitigating this concern, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the relationships of externalizing, anxiety, or depressive psychopathologies and AUD relative to CUD severity. As such, it is unclear how psychiatric comorbidities could account for the current data. Fifth, other indices of substance involvement were not available (e.g., age of ﬁrst use, cumulative exposure). Interestingly, using a Stop-Signal task, Filbey and Yezhuvath (2013) found that dependent, relative to non-dependent, marijuana using adults showed increased connectivity between right frontal cortex and substantia nigra/subthalamic nucleus and that the strength of this increased connectivity was modulated by both age of onset and quantity of cannabis use. In short, it is likely that these latter variables may modulate  790  J. Aloi et al.  NeuroImage: Clinical 19 (2018) 782–792  the strength of the ﬁndings here.  In summary, we found diﬀerential patterns of dysfunction associated with AUD and CUD symptomatologies. Elevated AUD symptomatology was associated with increased amygdala responses to positive relative to neutral stimuli and decreased responses in brain regions associated with behavioral inhibition and executive attention during incongruent relative to congruent trials. In contrast, elevated CUD symptomatology was associated with increased responses in the PCC, precuneus, and iPL for incongruent relative to congruent and view trials. These data suggest that correlates of AUD symptomatology diﬀer from those of CUD symptomatology.

Normative human aging alters neural selectivity and control processing in brain regions implicated in value-based decision processing including striatal, medial temporal, and frontal areas. However, the speciﬁc neural mechanisms of how these age-related functional brain changes modulate value processing in older adults remain unclear. Here, young and older adults performed a lottery-choice functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which probabilities of winning different magnitudes of points constituted expected values of stakes. Increasing probability of winning modulated striatal responses in young adults, but modulated medial temporal and ventromedial prefrontal areas instead in older adults. Older adults additionally engaged higher responses in dorso-medio-lateral prefrontal cortices to more unfavorable stakes. Such extrastriatal involvement mediated age-related increase in risk-taking decisions. Furthermore, lower resting-state functional connectivity between lateral prefrontal and striatal areas also predicted lottery-choice task risk-taking that was mediated by higher functional connectivity between prefrontal and medial temporal areas during the task, with this mediation relationship being stronger in older than younger adults. Overall, we report evidence of a systemic neural mechanistic change in processing of probability in mixed-lottery values with age that increases risk-taking of unfavorable stakes in older adults. Moreover, individual differences in age-related effects on baseline frontostriatal communication may be a central determinant of such subsequent age differences in value-based decision neural processing and resulting behaviors.

Introduction  Real life investments typically entail an expected gain proportional to the invested resource but also a possible loss, depending on outcomes. For instance, one spends money to buy an apple expecting to eat a juicy fruit but there is always a probability that there is a worm in the apple and the money spent is wasted. To maximize investments and minimize losses during such mixed lottery situations, neural networks in the human brain must be able  * Corresponding author at: Graduate Institute of Brain and Mind Sciences, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 1 Ren-Ai Rd.

Neural processing of mixed lotteries might also engage relevant strategies or beliefs where necessary or effective (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), such as noting past negative experiences at a particular grocery store, or prioritizing physical or mental health over money, or using only partial information to simplify decisions. Aging changes human brain functions such that neural representations of different stimuli are less distinctive (Goh et al., 2010; Park et al., 2004; Yassa et al., 2011) and the ﬂexible engagement of goal-directed control and strategic processing is diminished (Ardiale and Lemaire, 2012; Hakun et al., 2015; Harris and Wolbers, 2014; Konishi et al., 2013). Older adults also display distinct decision behaviors compared with young adults that, across different experimental contexts, reﬂect more variable decision  186  Y.-S. Su et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 69 (2018) 185e198  criteria, such as not always choosing options with higher EVs, and more reactive decision strategies, such as being more sensitive to recent outcomes (Pachur et al., 2017; Rutledge et al., 2016; Tymula et al., 2013; Worthy et al., 2016). These brain and behavioral differences between young and older adults motivate the need to determine the mechanistic links between changes in human neural processing of value and decision-making behavior as a person ages, particularly in light of the aging world demographic (Vaupel, 2010). Here, we reconcile how age effects on neural operations that selectively process information and apply goal-directed strategies impact assessment of EV in a risky lottery choice task (LCT).  In the LCT (Goh et al., 2016), which tests mixed lottery decisions, different probabilities (P) of winning (and simultaneously, losing; 1eP) are combined with different magnitudes (M) of points such that EV ¼ PM þ (1eP)( M) for any given trial (Fig. 1A). Stakes and outcomes are independent across trials so that the optimal approach is to decide to accept or reject the given stakes based solely on the objective information about EV provided in each trial. Moreover, because for any given magnitude of points, the probability of winning also determines the probability of losing the points, risk-neutral agents should have an acceptance decision threshold (DT) or certainty equivalence set at EV ¼ 0 (or p ¼ 50%) (Dohmen et al., 2011). DTs greater or less than EV ¼ 0 indicate riskaverse or risk-taking preferences, respectively.  Performance in this task might, in principle, rely on neural representations of EV (or even more simply, P) in ventral striatum (VS) that shows sensitivity to different levels of expected rewards or losses (Berns et al., 2001; Knutson et al., 2001; Preuschoff et al.,  2006; Schultz, 2000; Tom et al., 2007). Differential sensitivity to value underlies the role of VS in gating and selecting adaptive motor responses to obtain rewards or avoid losses (Nicola, 2007). However, the main neurotransmitter that operates in this region, dopamine, has reduced efﬁcacy with age (Dreher et al., 2008; Erixon-Lindroth et al., 2005; Kaasinen et al., 2000; Wong et al., 1997). Neurocomputational theory projects that reduced dopaminergic efﬁcacy results in lower signal-to-noise ratio during information processing that underlies less distinctive neuronal responses (or lower neural sensitivity) to different stimuli in target brain areas (Bäckman et al., 2010; Li and Sikström, 2002). In older adults then, we expect less neural sensitivity to valuative information in VS. This increases the likelihood that decisions will be less inﬂuenced by objective EV information and more inﬂuenced by more subjective processes in other brain regions that bias decision criteria.  Experiments have shown dissociable age-related biases in loss processing compared with gains (Mather et al., 2012; Pachur et al., 2017; Samanez-Larkin et al., 2007, 2010). This is consistent with socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen, 2006; Carstensen et al., 1999; Mather and Carstensen, 2005) that posits a shift in life goals toward senescence such that maintenance of well-being or positive affect has greater inﬂuence on older than younger adult decision-making. Two extensions are made in relation to EV processing. First, there should be enhanced affective reactions to prospects in general in older compared with younger adults, who should be more apathetic. Speciﬁcally, neural responses that track the desirability of EVs should be more evident in older than young adults in brain areas involved in affective processing. In our whole-brain  Fig. 1.

(D) Acceptance rates across the different levels of probability ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ DT  Y.-S. Su et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 69 (2018) 185e198  187  analysis, we focus on affective responses in the amygdala and anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) as these have previously been implicated during LCT processing (Goh et al., 2016) and other value-related experiments (Berns et al., 2001; Knutson et al., 2003; Phelps, 2004; Phelps et al., 2014). Second, older adults should engage greater down-regulation processing in response to situations that induce negative affect because positive affective reactions should not require regulation. As such, dorsomedial and dorsolateral frontal (DMPFC and DLPFC) engagement to down-regulate negative affect associated with unfavorable EVs should be more enhanced in older than younger adults (Mather and Knight, 2005). Overall, we expect that neural engagement in young and older adults during mixed lotteries should shift from an emphasis on veridical EV responses in the VS to more affective-like and regulatory responses in MTL and frontal regions. Given our previous ﬁnding of an overall risk-taking preference in older adults as a group during the LCT (Goh et al., 2016), we also expect here that greater expression of such affective-like neural responses should be associated with greater propensity to accept lossdominant mixed lotteries in the older age group. Speciﬁcally, we expected age differences in risk-taking behavior to be mediated by age differences in VS, MTL, and frontal neural responses to EV during choice processing in value-based decisions.  functional  Finally, if indeed there is a systemic alteration of brain regions involved in valuative processing with age, a more network approach to evaluate how age modulates the associations between brain inter-regional connectivity and risk-taking behavior might provide further complementary support for the aforementioned considerations based on regional neural responses. Evidence shows that lower white matter structural connectivity between frontal and striatal areas is an important determinant of the ability of older adults to process probabilistic reward (SamanezLarkin et al., 2012). In addition, antecedent reduction in frontal white matter tissue integrity is a hallmark of normative age-related structural brain changes that have been associated with cognitive decline, particularly in tests of executive function (Borghesani et al., 2013; Fjell et al., 2017; Gazes et al., 2016; Head et al., 2004; Hedden et al., 2016; Kennedy and Raz, 2009; Madden et al., 2017, 2009; Sullivan et al., 2010a,b). At least one study has also shown links between age differences in white matter structural connectivity, functional connectivity, and cognitive performance (Davis et al., 2012), albeit focusing on callosal connections between prefrontal homologs. Thus, age-related changes in frontal white matter tissue integrity suggests that age differences in baseline frontostriatal functional communication (as indicated by resting-state functional connectivity) should play a central role in older adult value-based decision neural processing and behavior.  We reasoned that neural functional communication during LCT processing (or LCT-related functional connectivity) might reﬂect a mediatory response to a primary effect of frontostriatal baseline resting-state functional connectivity on LCT risk-taking behavior. Speciﬁcally, disruption of frontostriatal baseline functional connectivity with age should drive altered functional communication in other neural networks engaged during decision processing tasks in older relative to younger adults that then inﬂuences older adult task-related decision behavior. In this light, we also examined functional connectivity between the frontal, striatal, and medial temporal areas during LCT performance and during resting-state in the same young and older individuals. We expected that if frontostriatal baseline connectivity is an important determinant of older adult value-based decision processing, then LCT-related functional connectivity between these brain regions should mediate between frontostriatal resting-state functional connectivity and LCT decision behavior, and that this mediation should be moderated by age.  2. Materials and methods  2.1. Participants  A total of 44 younger and 54 older adults volunteered for this study. Exclusion criteria were presence or history of neurological or psychiatric disorder, artiﬁcial implants, or other counterindications for MRI scanning. All participants underwent the MRI session followed by a neuropsychological test session on a separate day within 1 month. All participants gave written informed consent on the day of the MRI session for this study, which was approved by National Taiwan University Hospital Research Ethics Committee. From all volunteers, we excluded 2 younger and 6 older adults because of excessive head motion (>3.4375 mm translation or >3 rotation; on the basis of the size of 1 voxel) during functional scanning, 1 younger and 4 older adults because of having null responses for more than 15 trials in the LCT (the total number of trials in 1 condition), 3 older adults who showed equal acceptance of all choice conditions or greater acceptance of loss-dominant than gain-dominant conditions (indicating failure to understand the task), and 1 younger and 1 older adult who dropped out of neuropsychological testing (precluding assessment of cognitive status). The remaining participants entered into the analysis were 40 younger (mean age: 23.3 years; SD: 1.97 years; age range: 20.2e28.5 years; 14/26 males/females) and 40 older adults (mean age: 67.9 years; SD: 4.93 years; age range: 59.2e77.7 years; 12/28 males/females) (Supplementary Table S1). Mini-Mental State Exam scores for these participants were greater than 26 except for 1 older adult who scored 25, and 1 who scored 24, which were still within the normal range based on local age-adjusted norms (Sun et al., 2014). Participants were remunerated for their time in the study. One older participant did not contribute restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data due to technical failure while scanning.  2.2.  fMRI LCT stimuli, procedures, and behavioral analyses  The LCT task has been described in detail in Goh et al. (2016) involving a larger sample study of older individual differences. In this present LCT fMRI experiment, we adopted an expanded version to yield more robust estimates of neural response differences between young and older adults. Brieﬂy here, each trial in the LCT was divided into choice and outcome phases (Fig. 1A). The choice phase presented text depicting the win/lose probability and points magnitude. While probabilities and magnitudes varied continuously, choice conditions were treated as discretized ranges to facilitate counterbalancing during stimuli generation, presentation ordering, and also speciﬁc aspects of data analysis below. Supplementary Table S2 details the means and ranges of probabilities, magnitudes, and resulting EVs of each condition. There were 5 levels of win probability (low-low, LL*; middle-low, ML*; middle-middle, MM*; middle-high, MH*; high-high, HH*) and 3 levels of magnitude (low, *L; middle, *M; high, *H) comprising the 15 choice conditions (LLL, LLM, LLH, MLL, MLM MLH, MML, MMM, MMH, MHL, MHM, MHH, HHL, HHM, HHH). Note, participants were agnostic to these discrete choice conditions and stimuli probabilities and magnitudes were continuously distributed from their perspective.  Choice text stimuli remained on the screen for 4 seconds, within which subjects decided to accept or reject the stakes with assigned button presses in the right hand. The choice phase was followed by a ﬁxation (with interstimulus interval [ISI] ranging from 1 to 5 seconds; jittered across trials) after which the outcome phase was presented for 2 seconds. Note that each trial presents a mixed lottery so that the magnitude at stake to be gained is also the same magnitude at stake to be lost. Outcomes were stochastically predetermined based on actual stakes of each trial with the limitation  188  Y.-S. Su et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 69 (2018) 185e198  that no condition could have only winning or only losing predetermined outcomes across all trials of that condition. If participants accepted the stakes, depending on the predetermined outcome, the outcome phase feedback would be either a gain or a loss with increased or decreased accumulated points, respectively. If participants rejected the stakes, outcomes would also be presented within parenthesis with no change in the accumulated points. Null responses also resulted in no change in points but with a reminder message to respond. Participants were given the goal to maximize their total accumulated points across 225 LCT trials. A ﬁxation (ISI ranging from 1 to 5 seconds; jittered across trials) then followed outcome phases before the beginning of the next trial. No combinations of probability and magnitude were repeated throughout the experiment.  Participants underwent a familiarization practice version of the LCT before MRI scanning. fMRI experimental stimuli were presented using E-Prime software version 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA, USA) back-projected onto a screen at the front of the scanner that participants viewed using a mirror mounted on the head coil. There were a total of 5 runs of fMRI scanning each consisting of 45 trials (3 trials per choice condition in each run). Trial conditions were presented in pseudorandom order such that there were no more than 2 consecutive trials with the same choice condition.  Analyses of behavioral responses were conducted using R version 3.3.1 (www.r-project.org). To obtain an individual index of risk preferences, logistic regression was applied on each participant’s binary accept/reject responses using trialwise EV as the independent variable ½log ðResponseÞ ¼ b0 þ b1EV þ ε to yield DTs ½ ðb0=b1Þ for each individual. DT is thus the estimated EV at which a participant’s acceptance rate (AR ¼ Naccepted trials/Nresponded trials) was at chance (0.5) (Supplementary Fig. S1) (Dohmen et al., 2011). ARs for each participant were also evaluated for the different discretized levels of probability of winning and magnitude comprising the 15 choice conditions. ARs for all choice conditions were submitted as the dependent variable in a 3-way repeated measures mixed-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) with probability and magnitude as within-subject independent variables and age as a between-subjects independent variable. To interrogate simple effects from the omnibus ANOVAs, post hoc comparisons were conducted using the “emmeans” package version 1.1 in R with Satterthwaite estimation of degrees of freedom. Speciﬁcally, pairwise comparisons of mean ARs between young and older adults for each choice condition were further conducted to evaluate signiﬁcant interactions associated with age based on the ANOVA with signiﬁcance thresholded at p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Similarly, response times (RTs) across the 15 choice conditions were also submitted to a 3-way ANOVA with post hoc evaluation of simple effects using the emmeans package in R.  2.3. Brain imaging acquisition protocol  Brain imaging was performed using a 32-channel head coil with a 3T Skyra System (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) located at National Cheng-Chi University, Taipei, Taiwan. For each participant, functional images were acquired using an echo-planar pulse sequence with TR ¼ 2000 ms, TE ¼ 24 ms, FA ¼ 90, 38 axial slices, 64  64 matrix, and 3.4375  3.4375  4 mm voxel resolution. Slices were aligned in parallel to the anterior-posterior commissural plane and positioned for whole-brain coverage. Two hundred eighteen volumes were acquired in each of the 5 functional experimental task runs and 180 volumes were acquired for 1 run of a resting-state fMRI experiment (rs-fMRI; eyes open focusing on a ﬁxation). A coplanar individual gradient ﬁeld map with short TE ¼ 4.92 ms, long TE ¼ 7.38 ms, and TR ¼ 500 ms, was acquired for  distortion correction and better spatial registration of the functional images. A coplanar T2-weighted structural image with TR ¼ 7480 ms, TE ¼ 102 ms, FA ¼ 150, 38 axial slices, 256  256 matrix, and 1  1  4 mm voxel resolution was also acquired for coregistration of functional to anatomical images. A high-resolution T1weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence with TR ¼ 2000 ms, TE ¼ 2.98 ms, FA ¼ 9, 192 sagittal slices, 256  256 matrix, and 1  1  1 mm voxel resolution, was acquired for normalization to template space.  2.4. LCT fMRI data preprocessing and analysis  Preprocessing and analyses of brain imaging data were conducted using SPM12 revision 6906 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UK). We created a studyspeciﬁc template to minimize biasing of effects due to age differences in brain structure. The high-resolution T1-weighted images for each participant were segmented and submitted to the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Linear Algebra procedure (Ashburner, 2007). This resulted in individual deformation ﬁeld maps that were subsequently applied to the functional data during the normalization step. For the functional images for each participant, we performed slice-time correction followed by head motion correction with unwarping based on the gradient ﬁeld map. Corrected functional images were then coregistered to the T2 then T1 structural images, and spatially normalized to the study-speciﬁc template with resampling at 3  3  3 mm voxels. Normalized functional images were then afﬁnetransformed to standard Montreal Neurological Institute space and smoothed with a 3D 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel.  Our main whole-brain analysis of the functional imaging data applied an exploratory approach to identify brain regions in which there were any age-related differences in neural responses to the different probability and magnitude conditions. Note that in the LCT experimental design, where each trial had a choice and an outcome phase, these phases were interleaved by jittered ISIs so that ﬁrstlevel general linear models (GLMs) of voxel blood oxygen leveledependent signal timecourses separately modeled choice and outcome responses for each trial, albeit within the same model. Thus, in this main whole-brain analysis, the ﬁrst-level GLM included 18 primary regressors based on the onsets of the 15 discrete choice phase conditions (5 levels of probability  3 levels of magnitude; Supplementary Table S2) and 3 outcome phase conditions (gain, loss, reject; see aforementioned Behavioral Methods), convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). Temporal derivatives of the aforementioned regressors to account for age-related delay of blood oxygen leveledependent signals, null response choice and outcome phases (if present; onsets convolved with HRF), and 6 motion parameters were additionally used as covariates shown in Supplementary Methods). At the group-level, ﬁrst-level wholebrain voxelwise neural response estimates for the 15 choice conditions of each individual were submitted to a whole-brain voxelwise 3-way repeated-measures ANOVA with probability and magnitude as within-subject independent variables and age as a between-subjects independent variable. We focused on age  probability, age  magnitude, and age  probability  magnitude interactions to identify voxels across the whole brain in which any responses to probability or magnitude were signiﬁcantly modulated by age during the choice phase. Because our focus in this study was on choice-related neural processes, outcome responses are not presently evaluated further.  (model equation is  We also conducted a second supplementary whole-brain analysis using model-based fMRI analysis that evaluated neural  Y.-S. Su et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 69 (2018) 185e198  189  responses to probability and magnitude as continuous variables. Studies have shown that responses to probability show linear effects reﬂecting value processing as well as quadratic trends reﬂecting more uncertainty (Knutson et al., 2005; Preuschoff et al., 2006; Tobler et al., 2007). Thus, we applied this more speciﬁc model-based fMRI approach as a means to corroborate resulting age differences in whole-brain activity patterns from the general exploratory approach aforementioned, and to obtain voxelwise summary coefﬁcient measures of neural sensitivity to probability and magnitude for regions-of-interest (ROI) analyses below. In addition, this supplementary analysis further qualiﬁed whether neural responses in brain regions showing age-related differences in the main exploratory analysis were driven by linear probability or magnitude effects reﬂecting value processing or quadratic effects reﬂecting more uncertainty. A P2 regressor was included to account for the contribution of neural processing related to uncertainty, which should peak when p ¼ 0.5. As aforementioned, choice and outcome phase responses were assigned separate regressors within the same model. Different from the aforementioned model, the ﬁrst-level GLM for this supplementary approach included 9 primary regressors that included the onsets of all choice phases as 1 regressor convolved with the HRF, 5 regressors that modulated the choice phase regressor by trialwise probabilities in a linear (P) and quadratic (P2) manner, magnitudes (M), and their interactions (P  M, P2  M), and as in the main approach previously mentioned, 3 regressors for outcome phase conditions (gain, loss, reject) also convolved with the HRF. Temporal derivatives of the aforementioned regressors, null response trials (if present; convolved with HRF), and 6 motion parameters were included as covariates (see Supplementary Methods). Regressors that modulated the choice phase regressor were nonorthogonal. In sum, this model-based ﬁrst-level GLM yielded whole-brain coefﬁcient images reﬂecting each individual’s voxelwise neural sensitivity to trialwise changes in P, P2, M, and their interaction P  M, P2  M during the choice phase. At the group-level supplementary analysis, these ﬁrst-level whole-brain coefﬁcient images were submitted to one sample ttest to identify voxels showing signiﬁcant neural sensitivity to the respective choice phase parameters across the whole brain in young and older adult age groups.  Signiﬁcance thresholds for all whole-brain analyses were set at p < 0.001 (uncorrected) with cluster size >15 for cortical regions and p < 0.005 with cluster size >20 for subcortical regions. Similar separate criteria for cortical and subcortical regions was used in our previous publication using this same LCT task (Goh et al., 2016) and was a means to adapt to effect sizes in the smaller volumes of subcortical tissue. Both criteria fulﬁlled a whole-brain clusterwise false discovery rate (FDR) of p < 0.05 based on Monte-Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations (https://www2.bc.edu/sd-slotnick/ scripts.htm; Slotnick, 2017; Slotnick et al., 2003).  2.5. ROI analysis  ROIs were deﬁned as 8 mm spheres around peak contrast voxels showing signiﬁcant interaction effects of age  probability and age  probability  magnitude from the main exploratory wholebrain analysis approach (age  magnitude did not yield signiﬁcant voxels, see results in the following). Neural functional response estimates for the 15 discrete choice conditions from the main whole-brain analysis were then extracted from ROIs for each individual participant. Response estimates were submitted as the dependent variable in mixed-effects linear regression analyses using R running the “lme4” package version 1.1e12 and ‘lmerTest’ package version 2.0e32. Independent variables in the mixedeffects linear model included probability (Prob; 5 levels), magnitude (Mag; 3 levels), age (2 levels; coded young ¼ 1, old ¼  1), the  interactions between these prior variables (4 in total), and sex as ﬁxed effects, and the intercepts for each subject as well as for probability and magnitude nested in each subject as random effects. Satterthwaite approximations were used to obtain denominator degrees of freedom for hypothesis testing of model coefﬁcients. Polynomial contrasts of the model coefﬁcients were speciﬁed and evaluated to interrogate the discrete linear effect of probability (Problinear), and the quadratic effect of probability (Probquadratic) and their interactions with magnitude separately for young and older adults as well as comparing between age groups. Effects of Mag and age differences in Mag responses were not evaluated in ROIs as the whole-brain age  magnitude contrast did not yield signiﬁcant voxels, see results in the following. Individual neural sensitivity coefﬁcients for continuous trialwise changes in P from the supplementary whole-brain model-based approach were also extracted from ROIs and used in correlation analyses and the analysis of their role in mediating the effect of age on DT.  For ROIs that presented signiﬁcant correlations between neural sensitivity to probability (P) or magnitude (M) with DT, we further assessed their joint mediatory contribution in the effect of age on DT. Mediation analyses were conducted using the “lavaan” package version 0.5-23.1097 under the R environment. The mediation model assessed the effect of age (young vs. old; 1 vs.  1, respectively) on DT via neural sensitivity to P (based on the model-based fMRI analysis) in ROIs as multiple mediators (Mj), with the causal events formulated in the following equations. DT ¼ iDT þ cAge þ εDT Mj ¼ iMj þ ajAge þ εMj Age þ X DT ¼ iDT þ c  bjMj þ εDT  0  In the aforementioned equations, i denote the respective model intercepts, c and c0 denote coefﬁcients for the effect of age on DT before and after accounting for the contribution of multiple mediators, respectively, a is the coefﬁcient for the effect of age on the jth mediator, b is the coefﬁcient for the jth mediator’s effect on DT, and ε denotes the respective model residual. Inference regarding the mediations is then evaluated by signiﬁcance testing of the indirect effects aj  bj (Hayes, 2015; Hayes and Rockwood, 2017). Note, although DT is indicated in the aforementioned equations, all analyses of DT with respect to brain responses were based on square rooteadjusted values (see results in the following).  2.6. Functional connectivity preprocessing and analysis  To assess functional connectivity, brain imaging data from the LCT experiment and rs-fMRI scans were ﬁrst adjusted for slice timing, head motion, ﬁeld distortion, and coregistered to T1-weighted images as with the aforementioned preprocessing procedures. Spatial normalization and smoothing were not conducted for functional connectivity analysis. Preprocessed images were then ﬁltered to remove linear signal drifts and frequencies higher than 0.08 Hz and lower than 0.009 Hz from voxel timecourses. Finally, voxelwise regression was used to remove the effects of 6 dimensions of head motion, the mean signal within white matter, and mean signal within cerebrospinal ﬂuid, and for the LCTexperiment, the task contributions of the 15 choice and 3 feedback conditions. The resulting residual timecourses for each individual participant’s processed functional data were retained to assess functional connectivity between ROIs. ROIs from the aforementioned main whole-brain approach were deformed to each individual participant’s native space using the inverse individual ﬂow ﬁelds generated from the Diffeomorphic  190  Y.-S. Su et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 69 (2018) 185e198  Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Linear Algebra procedure. For each participant, mean residual timecourses from each ROI were cross-correlated to obtain inter-ROI Pearson correlation coefﬁcients. Correlation coefﬁcients were subjected to Fisher transformation to yield z-scores for subsequent analyses. Moderated mediation models were constructed to assess the modulatory inﬂuence of age (young vs. old; 1 vs.  1, respectively) on the mediatory role of LCT functional connectivity between ROIs (Mj) in the effect of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between ROIs on DT (adjusted), which is formulated in the following equations. DT ¼ iDT þ cRSFC þ εDT Mj ¼ iMj  þ aRSFC jRSFC þ aAge jAge þ aRSFC$Age jRSFC$Age þ εMj  DT ¼ iDT þ c 0  RSFC þ X  þ εDT  bjMj  In the aforementioned equations, i denote the respective model intercepts, c and c0 denote coefﬁcients for the effect of RSFC on DT before and after accounting for the contribution of multiple mediators (LCT functional connectivity), respectively, a is the coefﬁcient for the effect of age with its interaction with RSFC for the jth mediator, b is the coefﬁcient for the jth mediator’s effect on DT, and ε denotes the respective model residual. The indirect effect of mediators for young and older adult age groups are computed as  bj  Age. Inference regarding the moderaRSFCj ated mediation is then evaluated by signiﬁcance testing of the  bj estimates relative to zero for the age effect on the aRSFC$Agej mediation (Hayes, 2015; Hayes and Rockwood, 2017).   bj þ aRSFC$Agej  3. Results  3.1. Higher risk-taking in older than younger adults in lottery choice decisions  Older adults showed lower DTs than younger adults (old: DT (SD) ¼  14.9 (22.9); young: DT (SD) ¼  2.56 (7.20); t78 ¼ 3.24, p ¼ 0.002, Fig. 1B) indicating more risk-taking behavior in the former. p Square root adjustment of absolute DT to account for the skewed ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ distribution yielded the same statistical DT (SD) ¼  2.66 (2.99); young: (SD) ¼  0.98 (1.88); t78 ¼ 3.01, p ¼ 0.003, Fig. 1C) and this adjusted DT is used for subsequent correlations against neural responses. Removing the 4 older individuals with the lowest DTs did not change the overall results (Supplementary Results) so that these were considered within representative performance range (see also Goh et al., 2016).  p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ DT  result  (old:  Analysis of AR across the 15 choice conditions further revealed that age differences were present from middle to lower probability conditions (Fig. 1D). Speciﬁcally, a repeated measures ANOVA yielded signiﬁcant interaction effects between probability, magnitude, and age group (F8,624 ¼ 2.12, p ¼ 0.032) on AR, between probability and age group (F4,312 ¼ 6.18, p < 0.001), between magnitude and age group (F2,156 ¼ 7.76, p < 0.001), and between probability and magnitude (F8,624 ¼ 15.18, p < 0.001), as well as signiﬁcant main effects of age group (F1,78 ¼ 5.90, p ¼ 0.017), probability (F4,312 ¼ 848.67, p < 0.001), and magnitude (F2,156 ¼ 5.86, p ¼ 0.003). Post hoc comparisons parsing out the 3-way interaction effect showed signiﬁcantly higher ARs in older than younger adults in the MMM (t603.58 ¼ 3.44, p ¼ 0.009), MMH (t603.58 ¼ 3.39, p ¼ 0.011), MLM (t603.58 ¼ 3.99, p ¼ 0.001), MLH (t603.58 ¼ 3.80, p ¼ 0.002), LLM (t603.58 ¼ 3.17, p ¼ 0.024), and LLH (t603.58 ¼ 3.76, p ¼ 0.003) conditions. Thus, while young adults losing and higher reduced ARs to increasing probabilities of  magnitudes of cost constituting the trial EVs, older adults accepted more middle to lower probability stakes than younger adults particularly as the magnitude of points became more tempting, albeit unfavorable.  Analysis of RTs also revealed age differences particularly in lower probability conditions (Supplementary Fig. S2). Repeated measures ANOVA yielded signiﬁcant interactions between probability and age group (F4,312 ¼ 3.42, p ¼ 0.009), and between probability and magnitude (F8,624 ¼ 4.53, p < 0.001), but showed no interaction between magnitude and age group (F2,156 ¼ 1.15, p ¼ 0.320) and no 3-way interaction (F8,624 ¼ 1.09, p ¼ 0.368). Main effects were signiﬁcant for age group (F1,78 ¼ 20.62, p < 0.001), probability (F4,312 ¼ 79.75, p < 0.001), but not magnitude (F2,156 ¼ 1.01, p ¼ 0.366). Because, not surprisingly, older adults showed typical general slowing of RTs compared with younger adults, and there were no age interaction effects with magnitude, post hoc evaluations focused on within-group pairwise comparisons of probability effects. These showed signiﬁcant RT increases from low to middle probabilities (ML*eMM*: t312 ¼  4.13, p < 0.001; LL*eML*: t312 ¼  2.86, p ¼ 0.046) and RT decreases from middle to high probabilities (MM*eMH*: t312 ¼ 7.01, p < 0.001; MH*eHH*: t312 ¼ 5.19, p < 0.001) in younger adults. By contrast, older adults showed less RT differences from low to middle probabilities (ML*eMM*: t312 ¼  2.12; p ¼ 0.346.; LL*eML*: t312 ¼  1.19, p ¼ 1.000) although RTs did signiﬁcantly decrease from middle to high probabilities (MM*eMH*: t312 ¼ 8.13, p < 0.001; MH*eHH*: t312 ¼ 3.23, p ¼ 0.014). Thus, younger adults reduced RTs when stakes were more certain (toward low or high probability conditions), whereas older adults evinced additional deliberation time for taking risks on unfavorable stakes.  3.2. Probability modulated young VS but older VMPFC and MTL  Repeated measures ANOVA of whole-brain functional responses (the main exploratory whole-brain analysis) identiﬁed signiﬁcant interaction effects of age by probability in the right VS, right MTL, VMPFC, DMPFC, and bilateral DLPFC, and age by probability by magnitude in the left putamen, but no age by magnitude effects (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S3). Note that the left putamen region is substantially dorsally and laterally displaced in the striatum relative to the right VS region so we treated these as 2 separate functional brain areas. ROI analysis with polynomial contrasts applied in linear mixed models (see Methods) further detailed the speciﬁc age differences in responses to probability and magnitude in these brain areas (Fig. 2BeG; Supplementary Table S4). Consistent with less distinctive responses to value, we found an interaction between age and the linear effect of probability (Problinear; t316 ¼ 2.73, p ¼ 0.007; Fig. 2B) in the right VS due to a positive linear trend in younger (t158 ¼ 2.45, p ¼ 0.015) but not older adults (t476 ¼  1.20, p ¼ 0.233), whose right VS responses were not modulated by probability. Instead, older adults evinced greater sensitivity to increasing probability in right MTL and VMPFC. Speciﬁcally, we found age by Problinear interactions (right MTL: t316 ¼  2.61, p ¼ 0.009; Fig. 2C; VMPFC: t316 ¼  1.96, p ¼ 0.0513; Fig. 2D) driven by linear increases in neural responses to increasing probability in older (right MTL: t158 ¼ 3.12, p ¼ 0.002; VMPFC: t158 ¼ 3.43, p < 0.001) but not younger (right MTL: t158 ¼  0.80, p ¼ 0.426; VMPFC: t158 ¼ 0.07, p ¼ 0.941) adults.  3.3. Higher responses to unfavorable choices in older adult DLPFC and DMPFC  Bilateral DLPFC and DMPFC responded with higher neural activity as probability of losing increased (or as probability of winning decreased in the mixed lotteries) in older but not younger adults  Y.-S.

Whole-brain signiﬁcance threshold was set at p < 0.05 (adjusted for FDR). Neural response estimates across probability levels were extracted from ROI identiﬁed from the whole-brain statistical volume that included (B) the right VS, (C) the right MTL, (D) the VMPFC, (E, F) bilateral DLPFC, and (G) the DMPFC. Contrasts testing linear (Problinear; solid black lines) and quadratic (Probquadratic; dashed black lines) effects of increasing probability on neural responses are shown where they signiﬁcantly differed across age. Error bar indicates SEM.; LL, ML, MM, MH, HH indicate different probability levels (see Supplementary Table S2).

(Fig. 2EeG). Speciﬁcally, bilateral DLPFC and DMPFC showed age by Problinear interactions (left DLPFC: t316 ¼ 3.35, p < 0.001; right DLPFC: t316 ¼ 2.24, p ¼ 0.026; DMPFC: t316 ¼ 2.51, p ¼ 0.013) qualiﬁed by negative Problinear response trends indicating increasing neural activity to increasing probability of losing in older adults (left DLPFC: t158 ¼  3.89, p < 0.001; right DLPFC: t158 ¼  2.52, p ¼ 0.013; DMPFC: t158 ¼  4.14, p < 0.001) but not younger (left DLPFC: t158 ¼ 1.25, p ¼ 0.213; right DLPFC: t158 ¼ 1.05, p ¼ 0.295; DMPFC: t158 ¼ 0.280, p ¼ 0.781) adults. Supplementary model-based fMRI analysis treating probability and magnitude as continuous and performed separately for each age group corroborated the previously mentioned ﬁndings on age differences in brain areas showing neural sensitivity to probability. Speciﬁcally, linear probability-related neural responses shifted from the VS in younger adults to MTL and frontal areas in older adults (Supplementary Fig. S3A).  Interestingly, we found interaction effects between the quadratic neural responses to probability (Probquadratic) and age in bilateral DLPFC ROIs such that younger adults showed inverted Ushaped responses across probability conditions in contrast to linearly increasing neural responses to lower probability conditions in older adults (young vs. old; left DLPFC: t316 ¼  2.28, p ¼ 0.023; right DLPFC: t316 ¼  2.89, p ¼ 0.004; Fig. 2EeF, Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig. S3A, C). Analysis of the left putamen ROI also yielded similar results as in the DLPFC ROIs. Speciﬁcally, left putamen responses showed enhanced inverted U-shaped Probquadratic neural responses particularly to increasing magnitudes, in young but not older adults, who again showed less distinctive responses across choice EV conditions in this striatal area (young vs. old: t794 ¼  2.09, p ¼ 0.037; young: t397 ¼  2.87, p ¼ 0.004; old: t555 ¼  0.526, p ¼ 0.599; Supplementary Fig. S4B). Note, unlike the  192  Y.-S. Su et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 69 (2018) 185e198  right VS, the left putamen did not evince signiﬁcant Problinear neural responses at the group level (Supplementary Table S4), supporting our approach to treat these brain areas as functionally distinct. Thus, bilateral DLPFC and left putamen responses reﬂect more neural engagement during middle (relative to high and low) probability conditions in younger adults, particularly at higher stake magnitudes. Such a neural response proﬁle is consistent with greater decision difﬁculty inducing greater cognitive control when relying on a p ¼ 50% (or EV ¼ 0) strategy, especially when stakes increase. This neural response proﬁle is also in contrast to the linear increase in DLPFC and DMPFC neural responses as probability to lose increased in older adults, indicative of a different decision strategy compared with younger adults. Modulation of neural activity in relation to the main effect of magnitude was observed in several brain areas but these were minimally affected by age (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S3B).  3.4. Frontostriatal neural sensitivity to probability mediates age effects on risk-taking  Correlations between ROI neural sensitivity to P (regression coefﬁcients for P from the supplementary model-based fMRI analysis) and decision behavior were evaluated (Fig. 3). In both age  groups, separately as well as the sample as a whole, individuals who had greater neural sensitivity to linear increases in probability of losing (negative linear neural sensitivity to probability of winning) in right VS, DMPFC, and left DLPFC demonstrated more risk-taking behavior, with lower adjusted DT scores (greater acceptance for more loss dominant stakes) (Fig. 3AeC). This correlation between greater linear neural sensitivity to probability of losing with lower DT across individuals was additionally signiﬁcant in the right DLPFC and left putamen in young adults, with the right DLPFC correlation also signiﬁcant for the sample as a whole (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Fig. S4C). However, linear regressions performed for each ROI failed to yield any signiﬁcant interaction effects of linear neural probability sensitivity and age on DT (right VS: t76 ¼  1.10, p ¼ 0.277; DMPFC: t76 ¼  0.95; p ¼ 0.343; left DLPFC: t76 ¼  0.79; p ¼ 0.435; right DLPFC: t76 ¼ 0.51; p ¼ 0.614; left putamen: t76 ¼ 1.37; p ¼ 0.176). Thus, individual linear neural sensitivity to probability in these ROIs was associated with DT, and age did not modulate these brain-behavior correlations.  We then evaluated whether greater linear negative neural sensitivity to probability in these ROIs during the LCT mediated the effect of age on DTs. We applied a mediation model to test the indirect effect of age on DT via simultaneous multiple ROI linear neural probability sensitivities Fig S5,  Section 2.5;  (see  p Þ in (A) the right VS, (B) DMPFC, (C) left DLPFC, and (D) right DLPFC in young (orange) and older adults (blue).

Su et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 69 (2018) 185e198  193  Supplementary Table S5A). Signiﬁcant indirect effects of age on DT were found for left DLPFC (Z ¼ 2.74, p ¼ 0.006) and right VS (Z ¼ 2.18, p ¼ 0.029) with a marginal negative effect of right DLPFC (Z ¼  1.86, p ¼ 0.063). Note that indirect effects of age on DT were also all signiﬁcant except for left putamen even when ROIs were considered in separate mediation models (Supplementary Table S5B). Thus, greater risk-taking with age operated through greater negative neural probability sensitivity in the right VS and left DLPFC with somewhat reduced right DLPFC involvement in older compared with younger adults.  3.5. Associations between resting-state and LCT functional connectivity of ROIs with risk-taking behavior in young and older adults  Given the aforementioned age differences in brain regions engaged for processing probability during the LCT, we further evaluated how baseline resting-state and task-related functional communication between the different neural networks in young and older adults were associated with LCT performance. We ﬁrst examined young and older adult DT associations with baseline RSFC between the ROIs identiﬁed in the main whole-brain analysis previously mentioned (Supplementary Fig. S6). During resting state (Fig. 4A, B), in younger adults, lower DT was associated only with lower functional connectivity between left putamen and left DLPFC. By contrast, in older adults, lower DT correlated with lower functional connectivity between left putamen and left DLPFC, between right VS and left DLPFC, and between right VS and right DLPFC. Linear regression analysis revealed a signiﬁcant interaction effect of age with right VS and left DLPFC RSFC on DT (t75 ¼  2.36, p ¼ 0.021). Speciﬁcally, higher individual baseline RSFC between the right VS and left DLPFC was associated with higher DTs in older but not in younger adults. Furthermore, note that right VS and left DLPFC were functionally disconnected (mean RSFC was not significantly different from zero) in older adults as a group during baseline resting state (see Supplementary Fig. S6).  We then examined young and older adult DT associations with functional connectivity during the LCT task (LCTFC) between the same identiﬁed ROIs (Supplementary Fig. S6; Fig. 4C, D). In young adults, lower DT was associated with lower functional connectivity between left putamen and right MTL. By contrast, in older adults, lower DT correlated with lower functional connectivity between the left and right DLPFC, and between DMPFC and right MTL. Linear regressions revealed a marginal interaction effect of age with bilateral DLPFC LCTFC on DT (t76 ¼  1.80, p ¼ 0.075). Note that LCT functional connectivity between bilateral DLPFC was signiﬁcantly lower in older than younger adults with aging (Supplementary Fig. S6).  3.6. Age modulates the effect of DLPFC-VS RSFC on LCT risk-taking behavior via mediation by LCT task functional connectivity  That frontostriatal RSFC modulated individual decision behavior more in older than younger adults suggests age effects on baseline functional communication in this network that may underlie the changes in the broader network engaged by older adults during the LCT task. Thus, we applied a moderated mediation analysis to evaluate age modulation of the effect of baseline resting-state frontostriatal functional connectivity on LCT decision behavior mediated by network functional connectivity during the LCT task. We focused on functional connections with any evidence for age differences in associations with DT from the aforementioned correlation analyses that included RSFC between right VS and left DLPFC as the primary causal effect, and LCTFC between left DLPFC and right DLPFC, between right MTL and DMPFC (where  p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ DT  correlations reached signiﬁcance in older but not younger adults), and between left putamen and right MTL (where correlations reach signiﬁcance in younger but not older adults) as mediators. We also hypothesized that older adults should have stronger mediation than younger adults of MTL and frontal processing during the LCT. Results and details of the moderated mediation coefﬁcients are shown in Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S6 (coefﬁcient means (SEM) of key effects are highlighted here in the main text). As expected, the model showed a signiﬁcant direct effect of right VS and left DLPFC RSFC on DT (mean (SEM) ¼ 2.97 (1.13); Z ¼ 2.62, p ¼ 0.004, 1-tailed; see Supplementary Table S6, c0). To provide an anchor then, a unit change in right VS and left DLPFC RSFC (which are Fisher Z-transformed correlations; see Methods) was proportional to a change in by 2.97, after accounting for the mediation variables. For young adults, there was only a marginal further negative indirect effect of the left DLPFC and right DLPFC LCTFC mediation (mean (SEM) ¼  0.517 (0.402); Z ¼  1.29, p ¼ 0.099, 1tailed; Supplementary Table S6, indirect effect for young adults for M2) of the aforementioned direct effect. In older adults, the aforementioned direct effect was signiﬁcantly positively mediated by left DLPFC and right DLPFC LCTFC (mean (SEM) ¼ 0.909 (0.540); Z ¼ 1.68, p ¼ 0.046, 1-tailed) and a marginal effect of DMPFC and right MTL LCTFC (mean (SEM) ¼ 0.941 (0.622); Z ¼ 1.51, p ¼ 0.066, 1tailed) (Supplementary Table S6, indirect effects for older adults for M2 and M3). Critically, age (young vs. older) signiﬁcantly moderated the mediation effects of the LCTFC between the left and right DLPFC (mean (SEM) ¼  0.713 (0.370); Z ¼  1.93, p ¼ 0.027, 1tailed), and between DMPFC and right MTL (mean (SEM) ¼  0.771 (0.424); Z ¼  1.82, p ¼ 0.035, 1-tailed) (Supplementary Table S6, effect of moderated mediation for M2 and M3). Evaluation of the aforementioned moderated mediation model based on simultaneous multiple mediators using separate models for each mediator yielded similar results (Supplementary Table S7).  4. Discussion  Our ﬁndings demonstrate a systemic neurofunctional difference in the way the older human adult brain approaches mixed-lottery choice decisions relative to young adults. Instead of directly engaging a more rudimentary VS-based stimulus-response selection in reaction to EV as in young adults, older adults evinced greater involvement across MTL, ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal, and bilateral lateral prefrontal areas that implicate more affective-like reactions and higher regulatory control. Critically, comprehensive analyses of various aspects of our brain and behavioral data provide support for the notion that age-related shift to involve more MTL and frontal processing of mixed-lottery choices underlies greater behavioral propensity to accept unfavorable stakes in older compared with younger adults. Speciﬁcally, altered neural sensitivity to losing stakes in bilateral DLPFC and right VS mediated the effect of greater age in increasing LCT risktaking. In addition, the engagement of LCT functional connectivity between left and right DLPFC and between right MTL and DMPFC in mediating the effect of baseline frontostriatal RSFC on risk-taking was more evident in older than in younger adults.  Several results in this present study comparing older (aged 59e78 years old) with younger (aged 20e29 years old) adult age groups are consistent with our previous study focusing on older individuals aged 55e80 years old (Goh et al., 2016). In both studies, mean LCT DTs in older adults as a group were in the negative EV range indicating an overall risk-taking preference, with this present study also showing that the DT was signiﬁcantly lower compared with that for younger adults. RTs were also slower for both older adult groups as EVs became more negative in both studies, particularly for more extreme risk-taking older individuals in Goh et al.  194  Y.-S.

Neural activity during older adult choice processing in this study increased with increasing stake probability in VMPFC and with increasing stake magnitude (but not probability) in bilateral ventral striatal areas, similar to our previous ﬁnding of increasing neural activity with increasing EV in these same brain areas. Finally, in both studies, older adult neural activity in bilateral lateral and dorsomedial prefrontal areas increased to decreasing EV or increasing probability of losing. Such replication of older adult behavioral and frontostriatal responses to valuative information in mixed-lottery choices further accentuates the differences in comparison with younger adults in this present study, who showed more risk-neutral behavior and ventral striatal sensitivity to stake probability.  Interestingly, although our previous study showed older adult MTL neural activity during the LCT decreased with increasing EV (and also increasing probability), MTL responses in this present study increased with increasing probability. We suggest that this difference in mean neural sensitivity to valuative information across older adult groups reﬂects the substantial heterogeneity of individual differences in MTL responses. Indeed, the previous study  found MTL responses ranged from having positive to negative associations with increasing EV across a much larger sample of riskaverse to risk-taking older individuals, respectively. Critically, evaluation of older individuals in that study revealed that although individuals with extreme risk-taking preferences showed negative neural sensitivity to EV in MTL responses, more moderately risktaking individuals showed minimum to positive MTL neural EV sensitivity. Thus, the negative mean MTL sensitivity to EV in the previous study may have been driven by more individuals with extreme risk-taking preferences sampled in that larger cohort in contrast to the positive mean MTL sensitivity to probability in older adults in this study, which might reﬂect relatively moderate risk-taking preferences in this present older adult sample. Nevertheless, in both studies, MTL sensitivity to value plays a more prominent role in older adult risk-taking decisions compared with younger adults. Taken together, the ﬁndings from these 2 studies provide complementary views of young and older adult group differences in neural responses associated with valuative processing of choices as well as older adult individual differences in these age-related effects.  196  Y.-S. Su et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 69 (2018) 185e198  Previous studies on age differences in value-based decisionmaking have reported mixed-ﬁndings on whether older adults are more or less risk-taking compared with younger adults. Metaanalysis across studies revealed that the mixed ﬁndings were largely due to task differences in the dependence on learning and memory, and framing of the decision context (Best and Charness, 2015; Mata et al., 2011). Not surprisingly, age differences are generally detected when the decision task required retrieval of past outcome histories. Importantly, in studies where probabilities are made explicit and learning from past outcomes are not required, the effects of age in risk preferences also differed if current choices are framed as potential gains, potential losses, or mixed (Pachur et al., 2017; Rutledge et al., 2016; Tymula et al., 2013). Speciﬁcally, for gain-only probabilistic lotteries, older adults showed greater risk-aversion than younger adults (Rutledge et al., 2016; Tymula et al., 2013). By contrast, for loss-only lotteries, older adults evinced greater risk-taking than younger adults (Tymula et al., 2013; albeit Rutledge et al., 2016 found no age differences). Critically, Rutledge et al. (2016) also evaluated mixed lotteries similar to our LCT in which choices in each trial were between a sure outcome or a simultaneous chance of gain or loss (with no null outcomes) and found higher risk-taking in older than younger adults, consistent with our results. It should be noted, however, that older adults may have a higher preference for certainty compared with younger adults in choices that involve sure versus probabilistic outcomes as in the previously mentioned studies, perhaps due to the reduced cognitive effort to process the former (Mather et al., 2012). Controlling for this, Pachur et al. (2017) presented young and older adults with 2 lottery options in each trial with different variable magnitudes and probabilities constituting EV and risk differences between the options. Computational modeling of their behavioral decision data revealed lower loss aversion (overweighting of losing EVs) and greater optimism of potential gains (overweighting of the probability of winning; see Hess, 2015) in older compared with younger adults, consistent with the higher acceptance rates for unfavorable mixed lotteries (low probability of winning high magnitudes) in older than younger adults in our study. In light of these prior studies, we highlight that our LCT task stimuli were straightforward texts that bypassed the need to translate from graphical representations of value as might be used in other studies, given age effects on perceptual processing (Goh et al., 2010; Park et al., 2004). The zero outcome for rejected lotteries also allows us to determine a more neutral certainty equivalence using estimated individual DTs. Finally, the LCT task favors decisions made solely on information given during each trial and discourages reliance on past reward history. Thus, although our paradigm favors more objective and risk-neutral decisions, we still ﬁnd that older adults display greater risk-taking behavior than younger adults. Overall, the emergent ﬁnding integrating across past studies and ours is that, barring cognitive demand and reward framing inﬂuences, older adults engage greater risk-taking behavior than younger adults particularly for unfavorable stakes in mixed lottery decisions. Critically, we add to extant behavioral literature by showing that this age-related change in risky behavior for mixedlotteries is associated with a shift in brain central processing of value from striatal areas in younger adults to more medial temporal and frontal areas in older adults.  It may be counter-intuitive that increased medial temporal and frontal activity that we interpret to reﬂect greater affective-like modulation and control is associated with greater risk-taking in older adult decision-making. We note, however, that increased control-related neural activity in older adults has been indicative of the heightened need for compensatory neural recruitment to cope with underlying declines in more primary neural processes (Goh, 2013; Hakun et al., 2015; Schneider-Garces et al., 2010; Zhu et al.,  2014) (5, 35e37). In line with a positivity bias (Mather and Carstensen, 2005) and the behavioral ﬁndings in Pachur et al. (2017), increased frontal and medial temporal activity for unfavorable lotteries in older adults is also consistent with greater neural processing engaged to regulate negative affect associated with losing prospects compared with the positive affect for more favorable prospects. Alternatively, higher medial temporal and frontal activity in older adults may reﬂect different motivations than younger adults, such as greater salience for winning under unfavorable rather than favorable odds, when making lottery decisions. These cases are not mutually exclusive and are consistent with age-related positivity bias and changes in the neural processing of goals and values (Samanez-Larkin and Knutson, 2015). We acknowledge, however, that our experiment only evaluates agerelated differences in neural and behavioral responses to different probabilities and magnitudes. As such, future studies that examine neural processes associated with speciﬁc motivations behind older adult value-based decisions and direct modulations of emotional reactions during decision processing are required to elucidate this issue.  That age effects were largely seen in neural processing of probability but not magnitude in our results agrees with studies that found age effects using tasks involving probability in decisions (Dreher et al., 2008), and those that found preservation in neural responses in older adults using tasks that did not involve probability (Lorenz et al., 2014; Samanez-Larkin et al., 2007, 2014). We speculate that such modulation of neural responses to probability but not magnitude reﬂects the speciﬁc inﬂuence of age on certainty processing in older adult value-based decisions (Mather et al., 2012) as well as distinct neuronal ﬁring patterns to different components of EV (Fiorillo et al., 2003). Speciﬁcally, in our experiment, neural coding of increasing magnitude might be more concrete and can be directly instantiated via increases in neuronal population activity that thereby scale the salience of other concurrent neural processes. By contrast, apart from such quantitative modulation of neuronal population activity, neural coding of the probability of winning or losing likely also involves more qualitative access to different beliefs about probability (Ma and Jazayeri, 2014). For this reason, neural coding of probability might be more susceptible to agerelated changes in the use of strategies that emphasize the subjective meaning, and thus framing (e.g., 10% chance of winning vs. 90% chance of losing), of a given probability.  In our study, baseline RSFC between the left DLPFC and right VS predicted older adult DTs during the LCT more than younger adults. This ﬁnding supports the association between older adult reward learning and ventromedial prefrontal to striatal structural connectivity (Samanez-Larkin et al., 2012), and suggests that the baseline efﬁcacy of frontostriatal communication is an important determinant of older adult decision neural processing and decision behavior. Indeed, the role functional connectivity between left and right DLPFC and between right MTL and VMPFC during the LCT in mediating the effect of frontostriatal baseline RSFC on DTs was more evident in older than younger adults. Thus, apart from the inﬂuence of psychological differences in motivation and affective processing between young and older adults, we also provide evidence on more neurobiological aspects of brain aging that jointly contribute to older adult decision-making as well. Further work that comprehensively integrate white-matter tract and fMRI data in longitudinal studies are required to more precisely characterize how age changes in brain structural connections conduct dynamic functional communication between frontal and striatal brain regions that then bear on older adult information processing associated with decision behaviors.  Finally, and more broadly, it is intriguing to consider whether responding to veridical EV is always the optimal approach when  Y.-S.

With age comes wisdom (Worthy et al., 2011) and extended prior subjective experiences with the environment. For humans, relative to other species, this experience can be communicated via stable and also complex means within and across generations. This suggests that as a species with rich social tools, humans can more effectively harness information about longterm environmental contingencies compared with more instantaneous snapshots of immediate contexts. Thus, the neural processes underlying the change in goals with age jointly reﬂect the effects of senescent neural functioning as well as cohort-wise assessments of environmental utilities. Individual differences across older adult value-based decision-making (Goh et al., 2016) then stand as critical indicators of the effects of the environment in relation to speciﬁc biological limitations. For instance, the human species did not much have to contend with issues of Alzheimer’s Disease (and other age-related cognitive declines implicated in frontal, striatal, and medial temporal functioning) until recent increases in life expectancy (Vaupel, 2010). In this light, we recommend that longitudinal studies are critical for investigations on broader economic implications surrounding aging human neural processing of value-based decisions.

However, self-related emotion processing in regular mindfulness practitioners is not extensively studied. In the current work we investigate differential neural and behavioral correlates of self-criticism and self-praise in 22 mid-to-long-term mindfulness meditators (LTM) compared to 22 matched meditation-naïve participants (MNP). In an fMRI experiment, participants were presented with blocks of individually selected positive (self-praise, SP), negative (self-critical, SC), negative but not-self-critical (NNSC), and general, neutral (NT) adjectives, and reported their affective state after the blocks. On the neural level, both SP and SC yielded more activation in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in LTM compared to MNP. Activation in this region correlated positively with non-react scores of the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and showed decreased functional connectivity to posterior midline and parietal regions in LTM compared to MNP during both self-related appraisals. Further, we found evidence for emotional reactivity in LTM on the neural level, particularly during SP. On the behavioral level, a mixed effects analysis revealed signiﬁcantly higher differences in affective ratings after blocks of SC compared to SP in MNP compared to LTM. Differences in DMPFC activation and affective ratings point towards increased awareness, potentially mindful regulation of SC and SP in LTM, while decreased connectivity to other regions of the default mode network could reﬂect a decreased self-focus in this group. As such, our results illustrate differences in self-related emotional processes in meditators and offer clinically relevant insights into mechanisms of mindful emotion regulation when facing self-criticism and self-praise.  © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  Self-related emotional processes are often disturbed in affective disorders. For example, depressed patients display a stronger and more negative self-focus (Greenberg and Pyszczynski, 1986; Joormann and Gotlib, 2010; Northoff, 2007) and increased rumination about negative aspects of the self (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008), while excessive self-critical thinking represents a vulnerability factor to depressive symptoms (Sherry et al., 2012). Despite the fundamental role of such self-related processes for mental health, research has only started to investigate  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics,  Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich, Switzerland.

At the same time, concepts like mindfulness and self-compassion have been increasingly incorporated into psychotherapy programs with the goal of facilitating healthier self-related processes (Baer et al., 2006; Keng et al., 2011). Mindfulness is often deﬁned as purposeful attention on momentary experiences in a non-judgemental way (Brown et al., 2007; Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Such a mindful state can be trained through meditation techniques and is believed to ultimately increase mindful behavior in everyday life (Kiken et al., 2015), for example in the facets: acting with awareness, non-judging and non-reacting to inner experiences, describing experiences, and observing (Baer et al., 2006). In relation to self-referential processes, a mindful present-moment focus can lead to a less attached and biased relation towards the self (Bishop et al., 2004) and less concerns with self-esteem (Brown et al., 2007). Moreover, self-related emotions might be faced less judgmentally  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.09.057 1053-8119/© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  J. Lutz et al. / NeuroImage 124 (2016) 958–967  959  and in a more accepting (Linehan, 1994), self-compassionate way (Neff, 2003; Thompson and Waltz, 2008). Thus, mindfulness and selfcompassion presumably lead to better emotion regulation skills with regards to self-related emotions, like dampening the negative effects of excessive self-critical thinking (Bishop et al., 2004; Hollis-Walker and Colosimo, 2011). Similarly, theoretical frameworks of mindfulness and neurobiological correlates propose changes in self-related functions as key mechanisms of salutary effects of mindfulness (Hölzel et al., 2011; Vago and Silbersweig, 2012).  Despite these proposed mechanisms and the clinical necessity to understand mindfulness related changes in self-related processes, research in this area is scarce, particularly regarding the neural level (Hölzel et al., 2011). One inﬂuential study on mindful selfreferential processing after a mindfulness course found a shift from a narrative self-focus, associated with cortical mid-line areas like the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) towards a more experiential body awareness (Farb et al., 2007). However, other studies report increases in mid-line areas related to mindfulness, as during mindful affect labeling (Creswell et al., 2007; Lieberman et al., 2007), mindful self-awareness (Herwig et al., 2010), and mindful perception of emotional stimuli in meditation-naïve participants (Lutz et al., 2014), and also in mindfulness meditators during mindful breathing (Hölzel et al., 2007).  Many studies on self-related processes contain a factor of decision making, i.e., participants judge whether a particular adjective describes themselves versus someone else (Northoff et al., 2006). Studying selfreferential processes and particularly self-related emotions in this way involves decision making aspects, which arguably occur to a much lesser degree in every-day self-appraisals. A recent study therefore investigated negative and positive self-appraisals in the form of individual inner talk (Brühl et al., 2014). Both conditions activated the DMPFC and dorso-lateral prefrontal (DLPFC) regions, while positive appraisals showed stronger activations in emotion generative regions (amygdala/ ventral striatum). This study, being close to every-day self-appraising thoughts, has high ecological validity, but the appraisals were not reported to the experimenters, thus the emotional involvement and relevance for the individual was not fully controlled. A study by Doerig et al. (2014), used self-critical stimuli that had been individually chosen and evaluated by each participant before a block-designed fMRI experiment. For self-critical stimuli, they reported neural activity in regions involved in emotion generation (anterior insula/hippocampus/amygdala formation), and bilateral frontal areas, presumably representing cognitive reappraisal of the evoked negative affect. They further reported activations in midline prefrontal areas for self-criticism. However, the study was limited to negative aspects of the self and no behavioral measure complemented the results.  The goal of the current study is to extend the clinically relevant but limited knowledge on mindful processing of self-related emotions. By extending Doerig et al. (2014)'s paradigm, we studied differential neural and behavioral correlates of individualized self-criticism (SC) and selfpraise (SP) in meditators with experience in Vipassana and closely related mindfulness practices (Lutz et al., 2008) compared to matched meditation-naïve controls. We focused on the Vipassana tradition, because it inﬂuenced current secular, clinical programs like MindfulnessBased Stress Reduction (MBSR) or Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) (Chiesa and Malinowski, 2011), and would potentially allow ﬁrst translational insights into altered self-related emotional processes through mindfulness training.  We hypothesized that 1) mid-to-long-term, regular mindfulness meditators (LTM) would show decreased habitual emotional reactivity to emotional, self-referential stimuli (SC and SP) both by decreased activity in emotion processing areas (extended amygdala/hippocampus region) and/or differential affective experience based on affective ratings after blocks of SC and SP. Similarly, we hypothesized 2) differential activity in prefrontal, self-referential and regulative areas, mainly DLPFC and DMPFC regions. Given the mixed ﬁndings for prefrontal areas, we  formulated this hypothesis non-directional. In addition, we explored neural correlations with particular aspects of trait mindfulness and differences in the functional connectivity between LTM and MNP.  Materials and methods  Subjects  Mid-to-long-term meditation practitioners (LTM) were recruited via local meditation groups and personal contacts. We required meditators to have more than one year of meditation experience with at least one year of regular Vipassana training, Vipassana retreat experience and a current meditation practice of at least one hour per week. We included 22 LTM (ages: 28–67, mean = 47, SD = 11.11, 10 female) with an average of 4861.50 lifetime practice hours in Vipassana or closely related open monitoring meditation techniques (Lutz et al., 2008) (range 281–18,325), and an average of 5971 h (range 506–18,805) when considering all meditation experience in this group (see Supplementary Material for full disclosure of LTM's mindfulness related experience and current practice).  LTM were matched with 22 nearly or completely meditation-naïve participants (MNP, ages: 29–64, mean = 45.45, SD = 10.94, 8 female), recruited via mailing lists and personal contacts. For matching statistics see Supplementary Material, Tables 4 and 5. MNP did not have a current or recent meditation practice (Supplementary Material, Table 3). Matching variables were age, gender, years of education and highest degree of education, general ﬁeld of occupation, and crystalline intelligence measured with Mehrfachwahl–Wortschatz–Intelligenztest (MWT-B, Lehrl, 1977).  All subjects were right-handed according to a handedness questionnaire (Annett, 1970) and without self-declared mental or neurological disorders. Further exclusion criteria were intake of psychotropic drugs, consumption of alcohol N 7 units/week, cigarettes N 10 units/day, or coffee (N10 cups/day) (see Supplementary Material, Table 6 for characteristics of the sample) and general contraindications against MRI examinations.  The study was approved by the ethics committee of the canton of Zurich and conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, 1992). All participants gave written informed consent and received a ﬁnancial compensation.  Experimental design  Questionnaires  Within a week before scanning, participants completed a set of ques tionnaires via an online investigation tool (Unipark, QuestBack).  Of particular interest for this study were trait mindfulness and selfcompassion. Mindfulness was assessed by the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et al. (2006), German version: Translation by Stroehle et al. (2010), KIMS-D-Items, 2010; Michalak et al. (2008)), with the facets: 1) observing and 2) describing sensations, perceptions, thoughts and feelings, 3) acting with awareness, 4) non-judging of, and 5) non-reactivity to inner experience. For self-compassion we administered the Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003, German version: Hupfeld and Rufﬁeux, 2011).  Further, we assessed the ability to identify and describe emotions with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS, Taylor et al. (1985), German version: Bach et al. (1996)), participant's sociodemographics, and experience with meditation and mindfulness related techniques.  Before scanning we administered the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule PANAS (Watson et al., 1988, German version: Krohne et al., 1996) to control for mood before scanning. After scanning, participants were asked in a structured interview about fatigue, general experience, pain, and discomfort during scanning.  960  J.

Schematic representation of one experimental block (SC condition) including times of presentation. Introduction depended on the respective condition.  Stimuli  Stimuli consisted of negative and positive personality-descriptive adjectives from the groups: appearance, social aspects, transient condition, talents, and dispositions and neutral words (Angleitner et al., 1990). The construction of 52 negative and neutral adjectives has been described in Doerig et al. (2014) and has been adopted for the additional list of 52 positive adjectives in the current experiment.  Within a week before scanning, participants selected via the online investigation tool all applicable, but a minimum of six self-critical (SC) adjectives, and six negative, but not self-relevant and thus not selfcritical (NNSC) adjectives from the list of negative adjectives. From the list of positive adjectives they selected all applicable, but a minimum of six self-praising (SP) adjectives. They further rated the adjectives regarding their subjective negative and positive valence (e.g., for SC-stimuli: “How negative do you perceive this trait?”) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “1: not at all” to “5: very much”.  For experimental stimulation, each adjective was supplemented with three synonymical adjectives from the same self-schema (compare Doerig et al., 2014).  Experiment  The experiment is based on Doerig et al. (2014)'s paradigm, extend ed with a self-praising condition and affective ratings.  The four conditions (SC, SP, NNSC, NT) and interjacent blocks of rest were presented in pseudo-randomized order. The introduction varied depending on the respective condition (self-criticism: “I am too”; selfpraise: “I am very”, negative non-self-referential: “I am not”; neutral: “it is”), followed by a ﬁxation cross. Subsequently, the four adjectives relating to a particular self-schema were presented, separated by ﬁxation crosses. A block lasted for 24 s. Subjects were instructed to focus on the meaning of the adjectives and any emotional response triggered by the adjectives. During the blocks of rest, subjects were asked to relax and do nothing in particular. LTM were speciﬁcally reminded to not meditate during the task or rest periods. After SC, SP, NNSC and NT blocks we acquired affective ratings and showed a ﬁxation cross (duration: 2 s + not used affective rating time). Each condition and rest periods were presented six times, resulting in 30 blocks and a total scan time of 15 min 15 s (see Fig. 1).  All negative, positive and neutral adjectives were presented only once. Two versions of the task were created, starting either with SC or SP. Subjects were randomly assigned to a version, each version was administered to half of the participants in each group. The task was programmed with Presentation™, Neurobehavioral Systems, USA and was presented via digital goggles (Resonance Technologies, Northridge, CA, USA). Subjects completed a trial run with meaningless adjectives before scanning.  Affective rating  As a manipulation check and insight into subjective experience during the experiment, we acquired affective ratings using a track ball (Current Designs, Philadelphia, USA) within a maximal time window of 6 s. To ensure participants would not mis-identify the affective rating as the main goal of the study, the instruction was to spontaneously answer the question “How do you feel in this moment?” but mainly  focus on the task with the adjectives. Ratings were given on a discrete scale with the Self-Assessment Mannikins as 5 anchoring points (Bradley and Lang, 1994). The discrete scale was coded in steps of 1, ranging from −250 (=mannikin very unhappy) to 250 (=mannikin very happy) with 0 as neutral.  Since ratings of an individual were correlated (ICC1 0.53), the nested data structure had to be taken into account. We formulated a linear mixed model to explain the relation between the dependent variable rating and the ﬁxed effects group and condition. Condition had SC as the reference level and further contained SP and the two non-selfreferential conditions NNSC and NT. The group factor had two levels (LTM, MNP). Our model contained a random effect for each subject.2 Since we hypothesized group differences in ratings after self-related emotional conditions but not after non-self related conditions we further included an interaction term for group and condition. Adding the group condition interaction signiﬁcantly improved model ﬁt (χ2(3) = 12.75, p = .005). Analysis of the mixed effects model was conducted using the lme4 library (Bates et al., 2014) in RStudio (Integrated development environment for R, RStudio (2012)). ICC was calculated using the multilevel package (Bliese, 2013), 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated using the bootstrap method.  Image acquisition  Scanning was performed at the University Hospital of Psychiatry (Zurich, Switzerland) using a 3-T Philips Intera whole-body MR unit equipped with a Philips SENSE head coil. With a sensitivity-encoded (Pruessmann et al., 1999) singleshot echo-planar sequence (SENSEsshEPI), 305 T2*-weighted echo planar image volumes with bloodoxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired (repetitiontime (TR)/echo-time (TE): 3000/30 ms, 36 transversal slices, whole brain, slice thickness: 4.0 mm, ﬁeld of view (FOV): 240 × 240 mm, matrix 80 × 80 voxel, resulting voxel size: 3 × 3 × 4 mm, orientation, SENSEfactor: 2.0). For each participant, a T1-weighted high-resolution image was acquired (TR/TE 6.73/3.1 ms; voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm, 145 slices, sagittal orientation, FOV: 230 × 225 × 225 mm).  Image pre-processing  Preprocessing and statistical analyses were conducted with the FSL software toolbox (Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, FMRIB, Smith et al., 2004). Preprocessing of the functional data included motion correction (MCFLIRT, Jenkinson et al., 2002), non-brain removal (BET, Smith, 2002), spatial smoothing (fullwidth half-maximum) with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm, grand-mean intensity normalization (FILM prewhitening, Woolrich et al., 2001) and highpass temporal ﬁltering with a cutoff period of 100 s. Pre-processed functional images were spatially registered to each subject's skullstripped high-resolution anatomical image using a boundary-based registration algorithm (BBR, Greve and Fischl, 2009). Normalization of the high resolution structural image to the standard space (Montreal Neurological  2 We determined the random effects structure of our model by comparing model ﬁts between a random intercept and a random intercept random slope for subject in group. The latter decreased the model ﬁt. Thus our ﬁnal model contained a random effect for subject.  J.

We applied the same statistical thresholds and FWE-correction as in the main analysis.  General linear model image analyses  Whole-brain analysis was conducted using the standard general linear model (GLM) approach, implemented in FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 6.00. First-level analysis comprised a ﬁxed-effect model for each subject, with box car functions for the four condition regressors (SC, SP, NNSC, NT), convolved with a canonical doublegamma hemodynamic response function including temporal derivatives. Extended movement regressors were entered as nuisance regressors (6 motion parameters including their derivatives (+6) and the squares of the parameters and derivatives (+12)). Affective rating periods (scale, modeled as boxcars with scale onset and the reaction time of the trial as duration) were entered as regressors of no interest. z (Gaussianised T) statistic images were calculated for our contrasts of interest SC N NT and SP N NT. For reasons explained in the behavioral results section, we did not analyze SC N NNSC.  Second-level group comparison of the ﬁrst-level results was carried out using a mixed-effects model implemented in FLAME (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects, Beckmann et al., 2003; Woolrich et al., 2004; Woolrich, 2008). The whole-brain contrasts were thresholded and FWE-corrected using clusters determined by z N 2.3 and a cluster significance threshold of p b 0.05 (based on Gaussian Random Field Theory) (Worsley, 2001).  Conjunction and correlation analysis  In a conjunction analysis between SP N NT and SC N NT we determined group difference in emotional self-referential processes independent of valence, using the conjunction null method based on the minimum statistic (Nichols et al., 2005). To further investigate group differences in our contrasts of interest, we computed Pearson correlations between facets of mindfulness that differed between groups and percent signal changes in the conjunction cluster. We further exploratively correlated percent signal change in the conjunction with total hours of practice adjusted for age (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007) and with practice intensity (Fox et al., 2012). However, given the heterogeneity of mindfulness related experience in our LTM sample we did not expect signiﬁcant correlations. Functional mean activation from the cluster were extracted for each participant and converted to percentage signal change as outlined by Mumford (2007).  Psycho-physiological interaction  Based on the result from the conjunction analysis, we explored differences in functional connectivity between groups during self-related emotional conditions (EMO). To this end, we collapsed SC and SP conditions into a single EMO regressor and conducted a psycho-physiological interaction analysis (PPI, Friston et al., 1997), in which the activation in the conjunction cluster (SEED) was compared to linearly detrended whole-brain fMRI activations (TARGET). In this GLM, we entered the fMRI time-series from the seed (extracted on the subject level, with the conjunction cluster transformed into the individual's functional space) as the physiological regressor (PHYS) and the EMO regressor. Other task regressors (NNSC, NT) and confound regressors (affective ratings periods, movement) were the same as in the standard GLM analysis. To test the PPI in the generalized, most sensitive form for block designs (Cisler et al., 2014), we included separate PPI terms for the EMO conditions (PHYS × EMO) and NT (PHYS × NT) and modeled the PPI effect of interest as the contrast between these regressors (PHYS × EMO N PHYS × NT), including the analogous negative relationship (PHYS × NT N PHYS × EMO). On the group level, we compared group differences in these functional connectivity patterns (PPI LTM versus PPI MNP). In order to disentangle this slightly complex double-regression and get at the underlying linear relations between  Results  Stimulus selection and questionnaire results  Groups did not differ in the number of self-chosen SC and SP stimuli, nor in the positive (for SP) or negative (for SC) evaluation of their stimuli before the scan (Supplementary Material, Table 8).  Comparing trait mindfulness, measured with the FFMQ, we found signiﬁcantly higher scores for LTM only for two of ﬁve factors, namely for observe (t(42) = −2.38, p = .02) and non-react (t(42) = −3.30, p = .002). Further, LTM showed higher self-compassion (SCS) and lower alexithymia (TAS) scores compared to MNP. Both differences showed a trend but were not signiﬁcant (Supplementary Material, Table 6). Using a fdr correction for the group comparisons in all 13 questionnaire-measures (Supplementary Material, Table 8), only nonreact was signiﬁcantly different. Both groups reported similar levels of positive and negative affect before scanning. After scanning, they indicated similar levels of comfort during the scan. There was a trend towards more reported tiredness during the scan in MNP (Supplementary Material, Table 9).  Affective rating  Behavioral analysis is based on 41 subjects (nLTM = 22, nMNP = 19)3, of which 34 did not miss any rating, 5 missed 1, and 2 missed 3 ratings. Mean mood rating during the scan across all subjects and conditions was 100.80, which represents an overall neutral to slightly positive mood on our Self-Assessment Mannikins scale.  In the linear mixed effect model, condition signiﬁcantly predicted affect. Compared to SC (b = 46.74, CI [15.75, 78.26]), all conditions lead to a signiﬁcantly higher affective rating (NT b = 84.91, CI [53.64, 119.03], NNSC b = 107.05, CI [75.04, 139.09], SP b = 139.69, CI [107.14, 170.99]), conﬁrming our experimental manipulation (see Fig. 2). Group did not signiﬁcantly predict overall affective ratings (b = 21.02, CI [−14.93, 70.76]). But the interaction between group and condition was positive for SP and NNSC compared to SC stimuli, indicating that the difference in affective ratings between self-related positive compared to self-related negative adjectives was signiﬁcantly smaller in LTM compared to MNP (SP b = −32.44, CI [−52.85, −11.75]). As NNSC were experienced signiﬁcantly less negative than SC, it could not serve as a negative, non-self referential control condition for SC and was not further analyzed on the neural level.  FMRI results  Subjects with more than 1.5 mm of head movement in one direction were excluded from fMRI analysis, resulting in analyzed 41 subjects (Table 1), which did not differ from our full sample in sociodemographics or matching. FMRI results showed the same regions when adding an additional regressor to control for gender (results not shown).  Self-relevant versus neutral stimuli  SC N NT led to increased activations in mid-frontal regions, the insula, precuneus and visual areas in both groups (Fig. 3). At the group level, we found signiﬁcantly higher activation in the DMPFC region (superior frontal/paracingulate, BA 8; 8744 mm3) for LTM compared to MNP.  3 A technical problem with the track ball lead to a high amount of missing responses in  three cases (19, 15 and 10 out of 24).  962  J.

NNSC negative not self-critical, NT neutral, SC self-critical, SP self-praising.  The contrast SP N NT resulted in similar but larger and stronger activations compared to SC N NT in both groups (Fig. 3). In the group comparison, LTM again showed signiﬁcantly more activation in the DMPFC during SP N NT (BA 6, 17,400 mm3). Additionally, we found increased activation for LTM compared to MNP in widespread clusters, covering left middlefrontal, bilateral inferior prefrontal and insular areas, basal ganglia, visual areas including the fusiform gyrus, and mid-brain, thalamus, and adjacent left hippocampal/amygdalar regions.  The conjunction analysis of SC and SP stimuli versus NT resulted in a  signiﬁcant group difference in the DMPFC area (Table 2).  Note that middle-frontal, mid-brain, and hippocampal/amygdalar regions were signiﬁcantly activated in LTM in the SP N NT and SC N NT, while we found no such activations for MNP. While this difference survived the corrected group comparison only in the SP N NT contrast, it hints at a quantitative rather than qualitative difference in these regions between SC N NT and SP N NT for the group comparison (Fig. 3).  Correlation results  Correlation analysis between mean activation of the DMPFC cluster resulting from the conjunction analysis (see Appendix F, Fig. 4) and the FFMQ factors observe and non-react revealed signiﬁcant correlations with non-react. For SP N NT it was r(39) = .32, p = .04. Examining the individual groups, we found that the correlation was driven by LTM (r(19) = .49, p = .03), while there was no signiﬁcant association in MNP (r(20) = −.18, p = .44). The difference between the regression slopes after a Fisher-r–z transformation was signiﬁcant (z = 2.10, p = .04) (Fig. 4b). For SC N NT, we found a signiﬁcant correlation for both groups together (r(39) = .34, p = .03) and a trend for LTM (r(19) = .39, p = .09), while MNP showed no correlation (r(20) = −.09, p = .70) (Fig. 4a). However, the correlation coefﬁcients did not differ signiﬁcantly between groups (z = 1.49, p = .14). DMPFC activation was not related to hours of meditation training or practice intensity (p N .20).  Table 1 Sociodemographic variables of subjects included in fMRI analysis.  Psycho-physiological interaction  For LTM, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference in the linear relation (PPI effect) between the DMPFC and another region in the brain during self-related emotional conditions (EMO) compared to NT. For MNP, we found a positive PPI effect for EMO compared to NT, in regions comprising the precuneus area extending into occipital/superior parietal regions (left and right), and a cluster in the left temporal gyrus. In the group comparison MNP N LTM, we found similar regions, namely clusters in the precuneus/occipital areas (see Fig. 5), indicating that MNP showed stronger functional connectivity with these regions during EMO compared to NT conditions (for a schematic representation see Supplementary Material, Fig. 5).  Discussion  This study investigated trait differences in behavioral and neural correlates of individualized positive and negative self-appraisals between mindfulness meditators and meditation-naïve participants, during a non-meditation task. We hypothesized habitual differences between these groups when confronted with self-referential emotional stimuli, more speciﬁcally a decreased emotional reactivity to such stimuli in meditators. Indeed, we found less extreme affective ratings after selfappraisals in this group. On the neural level, they showed more pronounced activation during self-appraisals in frontal and limbic regions, particularly during positive self-appraisal. Further, their DMPFC activation correlated with a non-reacting attitude towards inner experience and was less functionally connected with posterior mid-line and parietal regions.  Questionnaire and behavioral results  To our surprise, the groups showed only few differences in measures of mindfulness and related constructs. One reason could be the limited comparability of self-report mindfulness questionnaires between meditators and non-meditators (Grossman and Van Dam, 2011; Van Dam et al., 2009) despite matched samples (Baer, 2011). Our groups differed in the factor non-react, reﬂecting a difference in general emotion regulation, i.e., allowing inner experiences and feelings to come and go (Hölzel et al., 2011). Non-react has been found to predict general well-being, decreased psychological symptoms (Baer et al., 2006), and increases with mindfulness training (Baer et al., 2008). For self-compassion we only found a group difference in the total score at trend level, and only if not corrected for multiple-comparisons. Again, this is somewhat surprising, given the reported relations between mindfulness and selfcompassion (Hollis-Walker and Colosimo, 2011). One reason might be that open monitoring techniques have no particular focus on selfcompassion (Lutz et al., 2007). Thus, other factors such as life-style or working in the ﬁeld of mental health might inﬂuence the level of selfcompassion similarly or more (Baer et al., 2008). Overall, the fact that the groups did not differ more regarding the questionnaires might also reﬂect a strength of the current study. We ensured a good matching of LTM with a healthy control group, consisting of equally high-functioning individuals, with on average good education, high levels of intelligence, and a comparable percentage working in mental health related areas. Thus, group differences we do ﬁnd in our study are arguably also less inﬂuenced by selection bias and demand characteristics, which are potential confounds in cross-sectional studies with meditators (Davidson, 2010).

We found group differences in affective ratings after blocks of SP compared to SC, suggesting that the difference between positive experience after SP and negative experience after SC was less pronounced for LTM. This pattern is in line with the notion of increased emotional balance as a result of mindfulness training. When faced with self J. Lutz et al. / NeuroImage 124 (2016) 958–967  963  Fig. 3.

This interpretation is corroborated by the fact that we did not ﬁnd a difference in affective ratings after NT blocks and that the number  of chosen adjectives and their evaluation before the scan was the same for the two groups. However, we cannot fully rule out demand characteristics, since LTM are probably aware of the assumed relation between emotional reactivity and mindfulness training. At the same time,  964  J.

The tendency of lower TAS scores in our LTM sample points into the same direction. Thus, differences in affective ratings between groups must be interpreted with caution.  FMRI results  In general SC and SP showed similar activation patterns, in both groups. Brühl et al. (2014) also reported similar activation during selfcriticism and self-praise, corroborating the notion that different emotional experiences share similar brain regions (Lindquist et al., 2012). Group differences were hypothesized in emotion processing, self-referential and regulative prefrontal areas.  Differences in emotion generative structures during self-criticism and self-praise  Unlike the previous study by Doerig et al. (2014), we observed no consistent amygdala activation during SC. On this basis, our hypothesis regarding group-differences in this region cannot be answered completely. However, LTM showed activation bordering the left hippocampus/ amygdala region for SC N NT and a similar activation during SP N NT, while we found no such pattern for MNP. Only the latter was signiﬁcantly different in the group comparison. For these regions, we propose a quantitative threshold effect rather than a qualitative difference, and interpret that LTM show evidence for stronger emotional processing of both selfreferential conditions compared to NT. We found a similar pattern for visual cortex activations, which could reﬂect less cognitive avoidance (Servaas et al., 2014), again suggesting stronger emotional processing in  a)     T N > C S e g n a h c   l  a n g s   %  i  0.4  0.2  0.0  b)  0.4     T N > P S e g n a h c   l  a n g s   %  i  0.2  0.0  0.2  MNP  LTM  15  25  20 Non react  30  35  15  25  20 Non react  30  35  Fig. 4.

In fact, differential activation in the DMPFC has also been reported in relation to emotion regulation, in studies on reappraisal of negative pictures (Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). However, studies also report decreased MPFC activation in meditators during emotional processing in a mindful state (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007; Grant et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2011), and less mid-line, default mode activation during resting state (Brewer et al., 2011). Differences in meditation experience might partly explain these inconsistencies. Deactivations are particularly reported for very experienced meditators (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007; Chiesa et al., 2013). As we found no correlation with meditation experience in this region we cannot add further evidence for this hypothesis. Other reasons for the contradictory results might lie in the speciﬁc task (e.g., active self-reference) and location of mid-line activation (dorsal versus ventral).  In our experiment, the positive relation between DMPFC activation and the factor non-react supports the interpretation of the DMPFC activation as a functional correlate of cognitive, appraising processes (Etkin et al., 2011), which in the case of LTM might illustrate an accepting and non-reactive appraisal of inner experience. The fact that the correlations seemed mostly driven by LTM, at least for SP, might indicate a behavioral shift in the reaction towards positive self-appraisals, which might be distinctive for meditation practitioners.  Similar to the DMPFC, LTM showed increased activations in lateral mid- and inferior prefrontal regions during SC and SP versus NT, with the latter surviving the group comparison. Apart from the interpretation as a typical emotion regulation area (Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Phillips et al., 2003), mindfulness related interpretations have been suggested for lateral prefrontal areas, such as cognitive labeling of emotional stimuli (Hariri et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2003), focused attention and open awareness (Manna et al., 2010), or the ability to observe thoughts and emotions in a detached manner (Fox et al., 2014). Taken together, differential activations in frontal regions could reﬂect stronger self-awareness and focus on inner feelings, and mindful emotion regulation in the sense of a non-reactive attitude towards these experiences in LTM.  Differential functional connectivity during SP and SC between groups  We found positive functional coupling between the DMPFC and regions in the precuneus and occipito-parietal lobe for self-relevant emotional conditions compared to neutral words in MNP. Functional coupling in these regions was also signiﬁcantly stronger in MNP compared to LTM. In LTM, emotional self-related stimuli did not result in differential functional connectivity between the DMPFC and other regions. The precuneus is part of the default mode network and has been implicated in general autobiographical memory retrieval and selfprocessing (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Northoff et al., 2006), while the adjacent occipito-parietal areas are relevant for visual attention (Pessoa et al., 2002). The stronger, positive functional coupling between midline regions in MNP might reﬂect stronger self-focus or attentional processing when facing emotional self-referential words compared to neutral words, while attention and/or self-focus seemed less inﬂuenced by stimulus type in LTM. A similar interpretation, namely reduced selffocused attention in meditators, was put forward by Garrison et al. (2014), who found reduced functional connectivity in the precuneus/ PCC in meditators during loving kindness meditation. However, these interpretations remain tentative and should ideally be corroborated with behavioral measures on the degree of self-focused processing.  Limitations and future directions  Our interpretations of brain activations in meditators remain speculative, as our ﬁndings are only partially in line with previous studies in  Fig. 5.

Areas in the precuneus and occipito-parietal regions were found in both analyses. Cluster coordinates of peak activation, region (including Brodmann area), cluster size, and peak signiﬁcance are indicated.  LTM. These ﬁndings might reﬂect higher present-moment awareness and acceptance of emotions in this group, which is partly in line with the ﬁnding of decreased control over emotion generative structures during emotional stimulation in experienced meditators (Taylor et al., 2011). However, it contradicts previous ﬁndings of decreased activation in emotion-generative structures in meditators (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007; Chiesa et al., 2013).  For SP N NT, there was additional evidence for increased emotional processing in LTM compared to MNP. LTM showed increased activation in the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex/ventral striatum, which could indicate higher reward and subjective pleasantness of positive selfappraisals (Kühn and Gallinat, 2012; McClure et al., 2004). Further, the insula, another key region for emotion generation and experience, showed increased activation in LTM, which could signify stronger emotional arousal resulting from less regulation and more acceptance of emotional states (Grant et al., 2011), or higher emotional awareness and monitoring of internal states during self-related emotions (Craig, 2004; Lutz et al., 2008).  Overall, neural activations in emotion generative structures seemed increased for both valences in LTM, contradicting our behavioral results. A possible explanation is the timing of stimulation and rating: LTM might have been more accepting and aware of their immediate affective reaction during SP and SC blocks instead of regulating their experience. Such a nonreactive attitude could result in increased emotional processing during emotional stimulation, similar to ﬁndings by Taylor et al. (2011), while affective ratings after the actual experience might be less extreme.  Differential activation in regulative prefrontal and midline structures  Similar to previous studies by Doerig et al. (2014) and Brühl et al. (2014) we found activations in anterior and posterior cortical midline structures associated with self-referential and autobiographical memory processing and default mode self-reference (Fossati et al., 2003; Johnson, 2002; Northoff et al., 2006; Whitﬁeld-Gabrieli et al., 2011)  Interestingly, these mid-line activations were more pronounced in LTM in both contrasts. This is consistent with previous research: Creswell et al. (2007) found that higher dispositional mindfulness was associated with increased DMPFC activation in an affect labeling task, and Hölzel et al. (2007) found DMPFC activation in a similar sample of meditators during meditation compared to arithmetics and suggested increased processing of emotions, like being aware of, identifying and attending to one's emotions (Phan et al., 2004). This is in line with the common functional interpretation of the dorsal MPFC as the cognitive/  966  J. Lutz et al. / NeuroImage 124 (2016) 958–967  meditators and the interpretations draw from assumptions based on traditional claims that meditators approach emotional self-appraisals in “healthier” ways. At the same time, our cross-sectional design, cannot exclude that meditators are drawn to practices like meditation because they are more interested or in need of developing skills to deal with emotions. Similarly, they might differ in other relevant personality or life-style factors from MNP. Further, as mentioned earlier, we cannot exclude demand characteristics. Even though we feel it is important to study concepts of self-praise and self-criticism in experienced meditators, our results should be veriﬁed in longitudinal designs, especially as we found no signiﬁcant association between the amount of meditation training and activation in the DMPFC. Regarding our samples, both groups were healthy and rather high-functioning in terms of intelligence, highest degree and occupation. It will therefore be important to expand upon our results by conducting similar experiments in more diverse and clinical samples.  With introducing the self-praise condition, we probably lost the ability to study harsh self-criticism, as we did not observe stable amygdala activation during self-criticism. At the same time we found the biggest activations and group differences during SP. Thus we gained new insights into possible links between positive affect and mindfulness — a relationship we are only beginning to study and which needs further research. Such research should incorporate concepts of positive psychology like resilience, positive outlook on life, and well-being, to fully grasp the potential of mindfulness training in the clinical setting.  We observed differences in an active self-referential task. Still, group differences might be associated with underlying difference in the resting state. Future studies should ideally combine self-referential and resting state analysis to shed light on the relation between these two modes of self-processing.  Lastly, with our design we cannot fully disentangle emotional from self-referential aspects, since the neutral stimuli differed from selfcriticism and self-praise in valence as well as in self-reference. From a theoretical perspective, it would be difﬁcult to fully disentangle these two dimensions: On the one hand descriptions of aspect of the self are in most cases emotionally colored. On the other hand emotional stimuli per deﬁnition are salient to the individual and involve self-related processes. Future studies might employ factorial designs to try and disentangle the inﬂuence of these two dimensions.  Acknowledgments  This work was supported by the SNF Project number 320030_146972/2.

Here, we examined neural activity during empathy for social exclusion and assessed how empathy-related neural processes might relate to subsequent prosocial behavior toward the excluded victim. During an fMRI scan, participants observed one person being excluded by two others, and afterwards sent emails to each of these ‘people.’ Later, a group of raters assessed how prosocial (e.g., helpful, comforting) the emails were. Observing exclusion (vs. inclusion) activated regions associated with mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus), and highly empathic individuals activated both mentalizing regions and social pain-related regions (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Additionally, the empathy-related activity in the anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex was associated with later prosocial behavior toward the victim, and exploratory mediation analyses indicated that medial prefrontal cortex activity, in particular, may support the link between trait empathy and prosocial behavior. Overall, ﬁndings suggest that empathy-related neural responses to social experiences may promote spontaneous prosocial treatment of those in need.  © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Empathy is considered to be a foundation of human social experience. It allows us to understand others’ feelings, even when they are different from our own, and facilitates prosocial interaction. In fact, decades of social psychological research on empathy has emphasized empathy's role as a catalyst for prosocial behavior. For example, feeling more empathy is associated with greater concern for others’ welfare (Batson, 1998) and more helping behavior (Batson, 1991, 1998; Dovidio et al., 1990; Schroeder et al., 1988; Oswald, 1996; Davis, 1983; Davis et al., 1999). Surprisingly, however, neuroimaging research on empathy has not examined empathy for others’ social experiences or the neural processes through which this empathy for others’ social experiences results in spontaneous prosocial actions. In fact, most of the research on empathy has focused on empathy for physical pain rather than empathy for negative social experiences (although see Immordino-Yang et al., 2009), even though observing negative social experiences is likely to be a more frequent occurrence. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) to identify neural regions involved in empathy for a negative social experience— social exclusion—and explored how neural activity in these regions related to individuals’ subsequent prosocial behavior toward the victim of this exclusion.  Behavioral research has suggested that empathy includes two primary components (Davis, 1983): (1) an affective component that  ⁎ Corresponding author.

Unfortunately, with behavioral measures alone, it has been difﬁcult to differentiate between these two components of empathy or to examine how each of these components might be involved in social interactions or relate to empathy-induced prosocial behavior.  Fortunately, recent neuroimaging research has begun to disentangle the affective and cognitive components of empathy by showing that each relies on distinct neural networks (Decety and Meyer, 2008; Singer, 2006; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009). Speciﬁcally, the affective component of empathy relies on limbic regions that are activated during direct affective experiences such as fear, disgust, and physical pain. For example, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula are activated both during the direct experience of physical pain and while watching another in pain (Singer et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2005; Botvinick et al., 2005). In contrast, the cognitive component of empathy relies on a network of regions associated with ‘mentalizing,’ the process of thinking about the contents of other people's minds, and includes the ventromedial, medial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices (VMPFC; MPFC; DMPFC), the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), the temporal poles, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the precuneus (Frith and Frith, 1999, 2003, 2006, Beer and Hughes, 2010; Mitchell et al., 2005; Singer, 2006; Hynes et al., 2006).  To date, most fMRI research examining empathy has focused on empathy for physical pain, rather than empathy for social experiences.  382  C.L. Masten et al. / NeuroImage 55 (2011) 381–388  Thus, it is important to extend this work by examining which neural systems underlie empathy for negative social experiences. Moreover, given the importance of empathy for facilitating prosocial behavior, it is important to explore which neural components of empathy (affective vs. cognitive) are most critical for facilitating prosocial behavior toward the target of the empathy. While two recent studies have examined neural correlates of prosocial behavior, these have focused on associations between various prosocial proclivities and empathy for physical pain (Hein et al., 2010) or general emotional pain (Mathur et al., 2010), rather than on empathy for social experiences in particular and the prosocial actions that occur spontaneously as a result of witnessing these social experiences. To address these issues, we examined: (a) the neural processes involved in empathy for a negative social experience (social exclusion); (b) which of these speciﬁc neural networks underlying empathy for social exclusion related to individuals’ spontaneous prosocial behaviors toward the victim of the exclusion subsequently; and (c) whether activity in these empathy-related neural regions might explain some of the association between empathy and prosocial behavior toward the victim.  In this study, participants were scanned while they observed three supposed people playing an online ball-tossing game from which one player was eventually excluded. First, we assessed neural activity while participants observed social exclusion compared to inclusion and explored how activity in these regions correlated with trait empathy. Based on previous work showing that the same regions are involved in both direct and observed experiences of physical pain (dACC, anterior insula; Singer et al., 2004, 2006), we expected that regions associated with the distressing experience of social exclusion (dACC, anterior insula; Eisenberger et al., 2003, 2007a,b; DeWall et al., 2010; Way et al., 2009) would also be activated during empathy for social exclusion. In addition, we also expected that empathy for social exclusion would engage neural regions supporting mentalizing processes (e.g., DMPFC). Although these regions have not been consistently implicated in studies examining empathy for physical pain to the same degree as the dACC and anterior insula (i.e., affective/ pain regions), we expected that empathizing with another's negative social experience might require mentalizing processes, such as perspective taking, in order to understand the heightened complexity and ambiguity of social situations, and why incidences of negative treatment might be occurring.  Next, we examined which of these empathy-related neural activations was associated with a tendency for subjects to display spontaneous prosocial behavior toward the excluded victim. Again, given the potential importance of mentalizing as well as affective processes, for deciding how to interact with others, we expected that regions involved in mentalizing during an empathic experience, in addition to those involved in pain-related processing, might relate to subsequent prosocial actions toward the victim.  Finally, we performed exploratory mediation analyses to assess whether any of these empathy-related neural activations might explain some of the relationship between trait empathy and prosocial behavior toward the victim. Given previous work showing that perceived self-other overlap mediates the relationship between empathic concern and helping behavior (Cialdini et al., 1997), we expected that regions that have been shown in prior research to be involved in perceiving others as similar to oneself (i.e., MPFC; Mitchell et al., 2006) might potentially contribute to the mechanistic processes linking empathy with prosocial behavior toward those in need.  Method  Participants  Participants included 18 individuals (nine females; M=20.22 years old, range: 18–24) recruited from undergraduate  classes. Participants were 72% Caucasian and 28% Asian American. All participants provided written consent in accordance with the university's institutional review board. Two participants reported that they had been suspicious about the study's purpose as they were being scanned. Since they were not outliers on any of the self-report measures, they were excluded from neuroimaging analyses only. Thus, there were 16 participants included in neuroimaging analyses (nine females; M=19.88 years old).  Procedure  Participants were scanned while they observed another supposed person being excluded during a computerized ball-tossing game (“Cyberball”; Williams et al., 2000, 2002). They were told that the study's purpose was to examine neural activity during observed social interactions and that three previous participants had volunteered to play the game via the internet during the scan. Participants were given the ﬁrst names and genders of these ‘previous participants’ (one male, one female, and the gender of the excluded player that matched that of the participant), and were instructed to watch closely and think about what the players might be thinking or feeling, how they were treating each other, and what strategies they were using to decide the recipient of each ball toss. Extensive measures were taken throughout the study to maintain the believability of the cover story (e.g., between runs, participants were asked to wait for a short time while one of the ‘players’ used the restroom). Participants observed two rounds of Cyberball: one in which everyone was included equally in the game (60 throws total), and a second during which one player was excluded for the entire round after being included for only 10 throws. This paradigm has been used successfully in previous behavioral and neuroimaging studies to simulate social exclusion and produce distress (Eisenberger et al., 2003, 2007a,b; DeWall et al., 2010; Masten et al., 2010a; van Beest and Williams, 2006; Zadro et al., 2004).  Following completion of the fMRI scan, participants completed a manipulation check to ensure that they had noticed the exclusion of one player and felt some degree of state empathy as a result. Then, they emailed messages to all of the players that they observed. The emails were later scored for how prosocial they were by a group of raters, and ratings of emails to the victim were compared to ratings of emails to the other players. Additionally, participants self-reported their trait empathy (see details of these measures below). After completing all measures, participants were fully debriefed about the deception involved in the study.  Behavioral measures  Manipulation check  Following the scan, experimenters asked participants whether speciﬁc events had happened during the game that they observed (e.g., “one player was treated unfairly,” “all the players participated in the game the same amount”). Results indicated that all participants had noticed the exclusion. Participants also indicated the amount of state empathy they felt while watching the exclusion round by reporting their feelings for the excluded player using a 5-point scale (1=not at all to 5=very much so). This measure included 10 items, such as “I felt bad for him/her,” and “It hurt to watch him/her play,” and was highly reliable (α=.92),  Emails to Cyberball players  Next, participants were told that they could email the players that they observed, since they did not meet them in person. To maintain ecological validity, real email accounts were created for each participant and all three Cyberball ‘players.’ Participants were instructed to write whatever they wanted about what they had observed (but were not explicitly told to mention the exclusion) and  C.L. Masten et al. / NeuroImage 55 (2011) 381–388  383  sent the emails when they ﬁnished. Following the ﬁnal study debrieﬁng, experimenters obtained participants’ permission to use these emails.  Prosocial ratings of emails  Eighteen raters who did not interact with the study participants completed questionnaires designed to assess how ‘prosocial’ the participants’ emails were to the victim and non-victims. Prosocial behavior is generally deﬁned as constituting actions that are helpful to others (e.g., helping, sharing, comforting, rescuing; Batson, 1998; Dovidio et al., 2006), and here we speciﬁcally focused on a subset of prosocial behaviors that were: (a) directed toward the observed victim (as opposed to people more generally—as in the case of charitable donation), (b) relevant to the speciﬁc context of social exclusion, and (c) realistic in the context of email. Thus, we speciﬁcally focused on how much participants tried to support, comfort, and help the excluded victims through their emails. Research has shown that social support and connection are desired following social exclusion (Maner et al., 2007), are effective in reducing responses to social exclusion and other aversive experiences (Cohen and Wills, 1985; Eisenberger et al., 2007b; Masten et al., 2010b), and facilitate recovery of self-esteem and feelings of acceptance following exclusion—even when they occur via the internet (Gross, 2009). To this end, raters answered three questions about each email: “Does it seem like they are trying to comfort this person?”, “How supportive are they toward this person?”, and “How much do they seem like they are trying to help this person?”. Raters were asked to consider their ‘general impression’ and to answer each question using a 7-point scale (1=not at all to 7=very much). For each email, the ratings for the three questions were averaged across the raters, and a difference score was computed for each participant indicating how prosocial their email was to the excluded player, compared to the non-excluded players (ICC = .89). This difference score was used in order to speciﬁcally assess how much more prosocial participants were toward a person that they observed being treated unfairly, above and beyond their prosocial tendencies more generally (i.e., toward the people who were not excluded).  Trait empathy  Participants self-reported their trait empathy using the Empathy Index (Bryant, 1982),1 which consists of 22 items assessing different aspects of perspective taking, empathic sadness, and concern for others (e.g., “It's hard for me to see why someone else gets upset,” “Seeing a woman/man who is crying makes me feel like crying”). Participants indicated their agreement with each statement using a 9point scale (1=very strongly disagree to 9=very strongly agree). Items were reverse coded appropriately and averaged to create one total composite score for trait empathy (α=.82).  fMRI data acquisition  Images were collected using a Siemens Trio 3-Tesla MRI scanner. First, a high-resolution structural scan (echo planar T2-weighted spinecho, TR=4000 ms, TE=54 ms, matrix size 128×128, FOV=20 cm, 36 slices, 1.56-mm in-plane resolution, 3-mm thick) coplanar with the functional scans was obtained for functional image registration during data preprocessing. Then, each round of Cyberball was completed during a functional scan lasting 168 s (echo planar T2*-weighted gradient-echo, TR=2000 ms, TE=25 ms, ﬂip angle=90°, matrix size 64× 64, 36 axial slices, FOV=20 cm; 3-mm thick, skip 1 mm).  1 Given that this sample of adult participants was collected as part of a larger study examining adolescent brain development, the Empathy Index was selected because of its relevance for developing populations (see Masten et al., 2010a). This scale was adapted slightly for an adult sample (e.g., references to “boys” were changed to “men”).  fMRI data analysis  Neuroimaging data was preprocessed and analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute of Neurology, London, UK). Preprocessing included image realignment to correct for head motion, normalization into a standard stereotactic space deﬁned by the Montreal Neurological Institute and the International Consortium for Brain Mapping, and spatial smoothing using an 8-mm Gaussian kernel, full width at half maximum, to increase signal-to-noise ratio.  Modeling of contrasts  Cyberball was modeled as a block design. Observed inclusion comprised two blocks (the period of inclusion during round 1 and the period of inclusion immediately preceding exclusion during round 2), and observed exclusion comprised the exclusion block. Linear contrasts comparing observed exclusion to observed inclusion were calculated for each participant. These individual contrast images were then used in group level, whole-brain analyses.  Group level, whole-brain analyses  First, we performed a group level contrast comparing observed exclusion to observed inclusion. Next, we conducted a whole-brain regression analysis examining correlations between neural activity during observed exclusion vs. inclusion and self-reported trait empathy. All whole-brain analyses were thresholded at p b.005, 10 voxels, for a priori deﬁned regions known to be involved in both mentalizing (e.g., DMPFC, MPFC, VMPFC, pSTS, PCC, and precuneus) and the affective component of empathy (e.g., dACC, anterior insula). This threshold is typical of studies examining a priori deﬁned regions and comparable to a corrected threshold of pb.05 (Lieberman and Cunningham, 2009). All other brain regions were examined at a threshold corrected for multiple comparisons (corrected for family-wise error in SPM5; p b.05, 10-voxel minimum cluster size). All coordinates are reported in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) format.  ROI regression analyses  Next, we examined which empathy-related neural regions were related to subsequent prosocial behavior toward the victim. Each of the clusters that signiﬁcantly related to trait empathy was deﬁned as an ROI, and parameter estimates of the difference in activity during observed exclusion vs. inclusion across every voxel in each cluster were averaged to obtain the mean difference in activity for each ROI. This average difference in activity for each ROI was then entered as the independent variable into a regression model predicting the difference score in prosocial behavior toward the victim vs. the non-victims.  Exploratory mediation analyses  Finally, for each of these ROIs that signiﬁcantly related to later prosocial behavior toward the victim, we performed an exploratory mediation analysis to examine whether empathy-related neural activity in the ROI might be involved in the link between trait empathy and prosocial behavior. Of course, in this investigation it was not possible to include a mediator (i.e., empathy-related neural activity) that was fully independent from the independent variable (i.e., trait empathy) given that the neural regions speciﬁcally involved in empathy for negative social experiences have not been previously identiﬁed in any other participant samples. Thus, we performed these exploratory tests simply as a means of assessing which neural regions might be important candidates for future examination of the processes via which empathy precipitates prosocial behavior. First, we used traditional methods of testing mediation, including Baron and Kenny's four-step approach to mediation (Baron and Kenny, 1986) and the Sobel test (Sobel, 1982), to examine whether the neural activity during empathy for social exclusion in each functionally deﬁned ROI signiﬁcantly mediated the relationship between trait  384  C.L.

In contrast, there was relatively little variability in prosocial ratings of the emails to the non-victims. The following is a typical example (prosocial score=1.63):  “Hey Danny, Hope you had fun participating in the Cyberball game! Thanks for taking your time out to participate in this study!”  Neuroimaging results  Neural activity during observed exclusion vs. observed inclusion  A whole-brain contrast revealed that participants displayed greater activity in neural regions previously linked with mentalizing when they observed someone being excluded vs. included by others (Fig. 1). Speciﬁcally, there were two signiﬁcant clusters of activity in the DMPFC as well as signiﬁcant activity in the MPFC, VMPFC, and precuneus (Table 1). Thus, when observing another person's social interactions, individuals may utilize mentalizing processes more when they observe someone being excluded than when they observe a group of people treating each other equally. Interestingly, unlike previous studies of empathy for physical pain, there were no social pain-related neural activations in response to viewing another experiencing social pain.  Regions associated with trait empathy  Next a whole-brain regression analysis was performed in order to identify brain regions that correlated with individuals’ empathic ability. This analysis revealed signiﬁcant positive correlations between participants’ self-reported trait empathy and activity during observed exclusion versus inclusion in several neural regions previously linked with mentalizing as well as social pain processing. First, greater trait empathy was associated with more activity in the DMPFC, MPFC, and PCC (Table 2), suggesting that individuals who report having greater empathic ability may also engage in more mentalizing. In addition, greater trait empathy was also associated with more activity in the bilateral anterior insula (Fig. 2a) and dACC (Fig. 2b; Table 2), suggesting that individuals who report being more empathic also display more social pain-related activity when observing another person being excluded. There were no negative correlations between self-reported trait empathy and activity during observed exclusion versus inclusion.3  3 Participants’ feelings of empathy for the excluded player were collected primarily as part of the manipulation check to ensure that participants were engaging in empathic processes as they witnessed exclusion. However, whole-brain regressions indicated that these exclusion-related empathy ratings correlated with brain activity in ways similar to trait empathy. Speciﬁcally, individuals who felt more empathy for the excluded player displayed greater activity in regions previously linked with mentalizing (i.e., DMPFC [2 40 50], t=3.49, r=.68, p b.005, k=40, and [14 30 64], t=4.30, r=.75, p b.0005, k=1129; MPFC [10 50 26], t=5.23, r=.81, p b.0001, k=85; PCC/Precuneus [8 −60 50], t=5.39, r=.82, p b.0001, k=821), and social pain processing (i.e., dACC [16 24 50], t=3.35, r=.67, p b.005, k=1129).

Then, given that these traditional methods can be biased when used with small samples (Preacher and Hayes, 2008), we also employed a bootstrapping method (scripted within SPSS; Preacher and Hayes, 2004) with bias-corrected conﬁdence intervals to further interrogate the signiﬁcance of these mediation effects (Preacher and Hayes, 2004; Shrout and Bolger, 2002). Bootstrap analyses and estimates are based on 2000 bootstrap samples.  Results  Behavioral results  Descriptive information  Participants reported feeling signiﬁcant levels of state empathy (i.e., scores greater than 1) for the excluded player (range: 1.1–4.5; M=3.23, SD=.81; F=11.40, p b.0001), suggesting that they were engaging in empathic processes as they witnessed exclusion. Participants also displayed a range of trait empathy scores (range: 4.86–7.45; M=6.09, SD=.82). Additionally, their prosocial behavior toward victims (M=4.46, SD=1.35; range: 1.80–6.50) and nonvictims (M=2.03, SD=.50; range: 1.15–3.00) differed signiﬁcantly (t=7.94, p b.0001). This difference score (i.e., prosocial behavior toward the victim above and beyond that displayed toward nonvictims; 0.17–4.24, M=2.30; SD=1.23) was used in all analyses (subsequently referred to as ‘prosocial behavior toward the victim’).2 Consistent with previous research, trait empathy was positively correlated with prosocial behavior toward the victim (r =.50, p b.05).  Qualitative results of emails  There was substantial variability in how prosocial participants’ emails were to the victims of the exclusion. For example, the following email to the victim was rated the most prosocial (prosocial score=6.50):  “Dear Adam, While watching your game of Cyberball I noticed you may have felt left out when Erika and Danny were consistently throwing the ball to each other. I just wanted to say I'm sorry that happened and I am sure there is some explanation that has nothing to do with you. You seemed to be a great ball thrower.”  Whereas, the following email to the victim was rated the least  prosocial (prosocial score=1.80):  “Hey Anna, Thanks for participating in the game with the other two participants. It was an interesting game, and I hope that you had fun!”  2 There were no meaningful differences in any of the behavioral or neuroimaging analyses if prosocial ratings of victim emails were used instead of the difference in prosocial ratings of victim vs. non-victim emails.  C.L.

Empathy-related neural activity associated with writing prosocial emails to victims  Next, we explored which empathy-related neural processes might contribute to individuals’ subsequent efforts to act prosocially toward the victim. To do this, we ﬁrst examined whether greater neural activity in the regions that were associated with trait empathy was associated with higher prosocial email scores to the victim. There were six regions of interest (ROI), in which activity during observed exclusion vs. inclusion correlated with trait empathy: MPFC, DMPFC, PCC, dACC, right anterior insula, and left anterior insula. Parameter estimates were extracted from each of these regions and regression analyses were run to see if neural activity in each ROI related to subsequent prosocial behavior toward the victim. Regression analyses revealed that neural activity in two ROIs related to subsequent prosocial email scores: the  Exploratory mediation analyses  Finally, we examined whether the neural activity in either of these two ROIs (MPFC and right anterior insula) might serve as a potential mediator of the link between trait empathy and prosocial behavior toward the victim. First, we performed these exploratory mediation tests separately for each of these regions according to the four-step approach outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). As reported above, trait empathy signiﬁcantly related to prosocial behavior toward the victim (β=.51, p b.05 for the 16 participants included in neuroimaging analyses), fulﬁlling step 1, and trait empathy related to neural activity (MPFC: β= .90, p b.0005; right anterior insula: β= .86, p b.0005), fulﬁlling step 2. For step 3, we examined whether activity in the MPFC and right anterior insula signiﬁcantly related to prosocial behavior toward the victim, after controlling for trait empathy. Activity in the MPFC was positively associated with prosocial behavior toward the victim after controlling for trait empathy (β=.52, p b.05), and the resulting relationship between trait empathy and prosocial behavior toward the victim became nonsigniﬁcant (β=−.25, ns) after controlling for MPFC activity (Sobel test = 2.20, p b.05). Although this test was not fully independent, this ﬁnding provides preliminary evidence that empathy-related activity in the MPFC while observing social exclusion may partially explain the relationship between trait empathy and prosocial behavior toward the victim. In contrast, activity in the right anterior insula was not signiﬁcantly associated with prosocial behavior after controlling for trait empathy (β=.31, ns) and failed the Sobel test (=1.20, ns). Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that the right anterior insula would have a signiﬁcant mediational effect in a larger (or independent) sample. However, in this particular investigation, the relationship  Fig. 2.

Masten et al. / NeuroImage 55 (2011) 381–388  occurrence that is salient and frequent during daily social interactions. As such, the current ﬁndings have extended previous research in three ways: (a) by identifying the neural processes that are involved in empathy for social pain, rather than empathy for physical pain—a topic which has dominated most neuroimaging research on empathy; (b) by examining which of these neural processes involved in empathy for social exclusion relate to subsequent displays of spontaneous, prosocial behavior toward the observed victim; and (c) by revealing a potential neural mechanism that may contribute to the well-known link between empathy and prosocial behavior.  Our ﬁndings indicate that the neural regions supporting empathy for social pain may differ from those previously linked with empathy for physical pain (see Singer, 2006). Speciﬁcally, mentalizing regions were more active during observed social exclusion, while activity in both mentalizing (DMPFC, MPFC, PCC) and affective (anterior insula, dACC) regions was positively associated with trait empathy. Thus, while prior studies have consistently found activity in dACC and anterior insula during observed physical pain, only highly empathic participants showed activity in the dACC and anterior insula during observed social pain, suggesting there may be important differences between empathy for different types of experiences (ImmordinoYang et al., 2009; Mobbs et al., 2009). For example, responses to observed physical pain may trigger an automatic, affective response such that most individuals spontaneously feel distress when they see someone in physical pain. In contrast, observing social exclusion might require an additional layer of mentalizing to understand the situation and imagine the victim's affective responses, and thus, might only elicit pain-related neural activity among the most empathic individuals. Given that understanding social situations is complex and relatively ambiguous, simply watching someone experiencing social pain may not automatically elicit distress like observing physical pain. In addition, this study also investigated which empathy-related neural regions related to subsequent prosocial behavior. Individuals who displayed more activity in the MPFC and anterior insula (in response to observing exclusion) subsequently chose to write more prosocial emails to the victims of the exclusion compared to the nonvictims. This is consistent with previous research linking greater empathy with increased prosocial behavior toward those in need (e.g., Batson, 1991, 1998), and suggests that individuals who experience more empathy for others who are experiencing negative social treatment will make greater efforts to help and support the victims in these situations.  These ﬁndings are also consistent with previous neuroimaging research showing that greater anterior insula (Hein et al., 2010) and MPFC (Mathur et al., 2010) activity during observed pain relate to greater prosocial tendencies (i.e., experiencing physical pain in order to ‘share the burden’ of the victim, Hein et al., 2010; or being more ﬁnancially generous, Mathur et al., 2010). Moreover, the current ﬁndings extend this work by showing that empathy-related neural activity relates to spontaneous prosocial behavior in response to situations that we are likely to encounter as a regular part of our daily lives. In other words, it is common to see people being treated negatively by others (i.e., being teased, excluded from a social event, discriminated against), and providing support and comfort is a frequently used method of helping these people. In contrast, seeing someone undergoing physical suffering and trying to help them may occur more rarely. Thus, the current ﬁndings suggest that both the anterior insula and the MPFC are important for understanding natural prosocial actions that result spontaneously in response to common, ‘everyday’ social interactions.  Exploratory mediational tests of these two regions indicated that the MPFC, in particular, might serve a mechanistic role in the link between empathic processes and prosocial behavior. In previous studies, the MPFC has been consistently linked with trait empathy (Rankin et al., 2006; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2003, 2005; Singer et al., 2004), emotional perspective taking (Hynes et al., 2006), and acting  Fig. 3. Activity during observed exclusion vs. observed inclusion in the (a) MPFC and (b) right anterior insula ROIs (functionally deﬁned as clusters that were positively associated with trait empathy) that is positively related to how prosocial participants’ emails were toward excluded victims (vs. non-victims). Scatter plots are provided to illustrate the relationship between the average difference in activity (exclusion vs. inclusion) across each ROI and the difference in prosocial ratings of emails to victims compared to non-victims.  between MPFC activity and prosocial behavior toward the victim (controlling for trait empathy) was 68% larger than that for right anterior insula activity, and this potential mediating effect of MPFC remained signiﬁcant after controlling for the potential mediating effect of the right anterior insula (β=.56, p b.05). Thus, compared to the anterior insula, the MPFC appears to be a more important mediator of the relationship between trait empathy and prosocial behavior in this sample.  Finally, we further examined these meditational effects using a bootstrapping method that takes into account the potential for bias in small sample sizes. Findings from these bootstrapping analyses were consistent with the ﬁndings derived from the more traditional meditational tests; the total indirect effect of trait empathy on prosocial behavior through the MPFC was signiﬁcant (95% conﬁdence interval: .37–2.64; p b.01), while the indirect effect through the right anterior insula was not (95% conﬁdence interval: −.32 to 1.78; p=.17). Taken together, these meditational analyses suggest that MPFC activity during observed social experiences likely serves a particularly important role in linking trait empathy and prosocial behavior.  Discussion  This study examined empathy-related neural processing and resulting prosocial behavior during observed social exclusion—an  C.L. Masten et al. / NeuroImage 55 (2011) 381–388  387  generously toward others (Mathur et al., 2010). However, it is also involved in mentalizing about others that are perceived as similar to oneself (Mitchell et al., 2006). Therefore, one possibility is that highly empathic individuals generally perceive others as more similar to themselves and thus more easily take others’ perspectives. As a result, they may relate better to others during empathic experiences and be more willing to help and support these ‘similar’ others. Consistent with this, Cialdini et al. (1997) have suggested that the commonly observed link between empathy and prosocial behaviors may be explained by a greater perceived self-other overlap among empathic individuals, which leads to a greater desire to act prosocially. Thus, thinking about how observed others are similar to oneself may be one important aspect of empathic processes that promotes increases in prosocial behavior. Although future investigations using larger samples and independent mediational tests may reveal additional brain regions that are important in promoting prosocial behaviors following empathic experiences (e.g., anterior insula), our preliminary ﬁndings suggest that the MPFC may be one important link in this chain that is particularly deserving of further attention in future studies.  In summary, the current study provides an important ﬁrst step toward understanding individuals’ experiences of empathy for negative social treatment and why certain individuals make efforts to help and support the victims of these negative social encounters. Eventually, understanding the neural links between empathic experience and efforts to help those in need may help explain the adaptive role that empathy serves in promoting positive interactions with others.

The role of speciﬁc brain areas for these processes is a matter of debate. In this event-related fMRI study, we varied the information processing mode of participants exposed to aversive and neutral pictures. Based on four different tasks, participants' attentional focus onto the emotional quality of the stimuli and the own emotional involvement was increased systematically across tasks. Regardless of task, stronger activation to threatening vs. neutral pictures was found in several regions such as the amygdala, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, primary somatosensory cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. However, there was a parametric increase of activation with increasing attention to one's own emotion speciﬁcally in the right posterior insula and right primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, i.e. in areas implicated in self-awareness of a person's own body. These ﬁndings are in accordance with theories suggesting a crucial role of the perception of bodily states for emotional experiences.  © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  The processing of emotional stimuli is associated with different stages of information processing. While implicit processing modes are related to rather automatic responses to emotional stimuli, explicit processing requires that subjects' attention is directed to the emotional signiﬁcance of stimuli or to one's own emotional involvement, i.e. to own feelings (e.g., LeDoux, 1996; Damasio, 1999). These different levels of information processing seem to depend partially on different neural systems (e.g., LeDoux, 1996; Damasio, 1999; Phan et al., 2002). Several prefrontal areas and the anterior cingulate cortex were suggested to be involved in cognitive-emotional interactions, such as certain high level appraisal processes, as well as in the generation and regulation of emotional responses (e.g., Lane et al., 1998; Phan et al., 2002; Ochsner et al., 2004; Straube et al., 2006, 2009a). In contrast, subcortical areas such as the amygdala have been proposed to mediate the rapid processing of emotional, especially of threatening stimuli, given a minimum of processing resources (Vuilleumier et al., 2001; Pessoa et al., 2002; Straube et al., 2007).  Besides these areas, brain regions that are involved in the direct representation of bodily states, such as the insula and the somatosensory cortex, were also proposed to be relevant for emotion  ⁎ Corresponding author.

This hypothesis is based on the idea that the perception of real or simulated bodily responses is an important factor for emotional experiences (James, 1884; Damasio, 1999; Craig, 2002, 2009). While the anterior insula has been suggested to serve as an integrative center for the representation and evaluation of interoceptive information, posterior areas of the insula, and the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex are more strongly involved in general awareness of the own body and several visceral and somatosensory sensations (Craig, 2002; Adolphs et al., 2000; Karnath et al., 2005; Khalsa et al., 2009).  While several brain areas have been proposed to participate in different aspects of emotion processing, the effect of the processing mode on brain activation warrants further examinations. To elucidate the speciﬁc role of a brain region as a function of the information processing mode, it is necessary to systematically vary of the level of evaluation of emotional stimuli and to control for other factors (see also Lieberman et al., 2007). In the present event-related fMRI-study, we systematically increased subjects' attention to one's own emotional involvement by means of four different tasks. If the experience of emotion is closely linked to the perception of bodily responses, increasing attention to own feelings should be associated with increased activation of relevant brain structures, such as the insula or the somatosensory cortex, which are involved in the processing of bodily states. In contrast, those areas that are involved in other or more general processes should not show an increase of brain activation across tasks.  T. Straube, W.H.R. Miltner / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 2534–2538  2535  Materials and methods  Subjects  Sixteen healthy, right-handed, female volunteers (mean age: mean=20.7 years, range =18–28 years) provided informed consent to participate in the study. All participants had normal or correctedto-normal vision. All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Jena.  Paradigm  Stimuli consisted of 20 threat-related and 20 neutral pictures taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 1999). In the center of the pictures either animals, plants, or humans (10 pictures per valence category), or a nonliving object (10 pictures per valence category) were shown. Furthermore, in the foreground of the pictures, a small line was displayed (see for examples Fig. 1). The line could have either a vertical or a horizontal orientation (see also Straube et al., 2006, 2008). For half the pictures the line was horizontal and for the other half the line was vertical. During scanning, pictures were presented via a back-projection screen onto an overhead mirror during two runs. During each run, subjects had to solve four different tasks (see below) with 20 trials per tasks, thus 160 trials altogether during two runs. The same pictures were shown twice in each task per run, altogether four times in each task (according to the tasks described below). Each task started with a cue (duration: 7000 ms) indicating, through verbal instruction, the kind of task that had to be performed while watching the next 10 neutral and 10 threat-related pictures. These pictures were shown in random order. Each picture was presented for 750 ms. Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA, time between onset of the previous and onset of the current stimulus) was 4200 ms. Between the tasks (this means between the last picture for a given task and the cue indicating the next task) a ﬁxation cross was shown for 11.2 s. Additionally, 10 null events [a ﬁxation cross, presented for 750 ms with 4200 ms SOA, indistinguishable from the ﬁxation cross seen during the interstimulus intervals (the time between the presentation of the pictures; see also Josephs and Henson, 1999)] were randomly intermixed into the sequence of stimuli per task and run. According to the suggestions by Josephs and Henson (1999) there were no constraints regarding the number of successive null events, which resulted in blocks of null events with three or more null events in sequence.  The tasks varied according to subjects' attention to the stimuli per se, the emotional relevance of stimuli and one's own emotional involvement. Thus, the task conditions were associated with increasing attention to one's own emotional involvement. In the ﬁrst task, the  level-1 task, subjects had to decide whether the line in the foreground of the pictures was shown in vertical or horizontal orientation. This task distracted subjects' attention from the background picture. In the second task, the level-2 task, subjects were asked to determine whether a non-living object or a living being was shown in the center of the picture. This task focused subjects' attention onto the emotional pictures, but not explicitly to its emotional content. In the third task, the level-3 task, subjects had to decide whether the pictures displayed a threatening or a non-threatening content. This task requested a conceptual decision on the emotional signiﬁcance of the picture, but subjects were not forced to attend to their own emotional response. In the last task, the level-4 task, subjects had to indicate whether they experienced the exposure to the picture as rather unpleasant or not unpleasant. Obviously, this task explicitly required that subjects referred to their own emotional involvement. For judgement, subjects pressed one of two buttons of an optic ﬁbre response box with either the ﬁrst or the middle ﬁnger of the right hand. The order of tasks and assignment of response buttons to the answer alternatives were counterbalanced across subjects. Prior to scanning, subjects were familiarized with the tasks using stimuli not shown in the later experiment proper. After the fMRI-session, participants rated the pictures of each category using a 9-point Likert scale to assess valence (1=very pleasant to 9= very unpleasant) and arousal (1=not arousing to 9=very arousing).  Behavioural data were analysed by means of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS (Version 16; SPSS, INC., Chicago). A probability level of p b0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. All data are expressed by mean±SEM (standard error of means). For analysis of reaction times and response accuracy, two subjects had to be excluded due to technical problems during registration of button presses.  fMRI  In the 1.5 T magnetic resonance scanner (“Magnetom Vision plus”, Siemens, Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany), 2 runs of 197 volumes were measured using a T2*-weighted echo-planar sequence (TE=50 ms, ﬂip angle=90°, matrix=64 x 64, FOV=192 mm, TR= 2800 ms). Each volume comprised 28 axial slices (thickness=3 mm, gap= 1 mm, in plane resolution=3×3 mm) being acquired with a tilted slice orientation to reduce susceptibility artifacts in inferior parts of anterior brain areas (Deichmann et al, 2003). Additionally, a high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical volume was recorded. Preprocessing and analysis of functional data was performed using the software Brain Voyager QX (Version 1.7; Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). The volumes were realigned to the ﬁrst volume in order to minimize effects of head movements. Further data pre Fig. 1. Examples of stimuli (left: neutral; right: threatening). Subjects had to indicate the orientation (vertical, horizontal) of the lines displayed in the foreground of the pictures during the level-1 task. During the other tasks, the same pictures, including the foreground lines were shown; only the task instruction was varied across tasks.  2536  T. Straube, W.H.R. Miltner / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 2534–2538  processing comprised a correction for slice time errors and spatial [8 mm full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel (FWHMK)] as well as temporal (high pass ﬁlter: 5 cycles per run; low pass ﬁlter: 2800 ms FWHMK) smoothing. Anatomical and functional images were coregistered and normalized to the Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). Statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression of the signal time course at each voxel including a correction for serial correlations. The expected blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal change for each event type (= predictor) was modeled by a canonical hemodynamic response function. Within- and between-group statistical comparisons were conducted using a mixed effect analysis, which considers inter-subject variance and permits population-level inferences. In the ﬁrst step, predictor estimates were generated for each individual. In the second step, predictor estimates were analyzed across subjects. First, we investigated the main effect of emotion across task. In the parametric analysis, we modeled a linear increase of activation to threat vs. neutral pictures depending on the tasks [balanced contrast values (threat, neutral) for Level-1, Level-2, Level-3, Level-4: −4 1, −2 1, 2 −1, 4 −1]. Activation was analyzed in regions of interest (ROI) according to our previous studies (e.g., Straube et al., 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009b, 2010b; Quadﬂieg et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2010). The following ROIs were deﬁned a priori using Talairach daemon software (Lancaster et al., 2000): dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), anterior insula, ACC, amygdala, posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex (posterior insula/ S2), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Statistical parametric maps resulting from voxelwise analysis were considered statistically signiﬁcant for clusters that survived a correction for multiple comparisons. We used the approach as implemented in Brain Voyager (Goebel et al., 2006) which is based on a 3D extension of the randomization procedure described by Forman and colleagues (Forman et al., 1995). First, voxelwise analysis was performed at any point and voxel-level threshold was set at p b0.001 (uncorrected). Thresholded maps were then submitted to a correction for multiple comparisons based on the search space for each ROI. The correction criterion was based on the estimate of the map's spatial smoothness and on an iterative procedure (Monte Carlo simulation) for estimating cluster-level false-positive rates. After 1000 iterations, the minimum cluster size threshold that yielded a cluster-level false-positive rate of 5% was applied to the statistical maps (for the ROIs were the thresholds, given in 3x3x3mm voxel, as follows: DMPFC, 3 voxel; VMPFC, 4 voxel; anterior insula, 4 voxel; ACC, 4 voxel; amygdala, 2 voxel; posterior insula/S2, 4 voxel; S1, 3 voxel.  Results  Behavioral data  Accuracy, i.e., the number of correct responses, was high during both the Level-1 (95.18 ± 1.52 % and 96.25 ± 1.10% for threatrelated and neutral pictures) and the Level-2 task (95.18 ± 1.52 % and 97.14 ± 0.51 % for threat-related and neutral pictures) and did not differ signiﬁcantly between valence categories for either task [t = 0.86 and t = 1.49; each analysis: p N0.05]). Analysis of subjective judgements showed that negative but not neutral pictures were classiﬁed as threatening (Level-3: 92.93 ± 2.92 % of the threatrelated pictures vs. 2.57 ± 1.51 % of the neutral pictures) and unpleasant (Level-4: 90.64 ± 3.06 % of the threat-related pictures vs. 3.29 ± 1.37 % of the neutral pictures). For reaction times (see Table 1 for descriptive data) the ANOVA revealed signiﬁcant effects of Task [F(2.33,39) = 10.37, p b0.0001) and Emotion (F(1,13) = 6.85, p b0.05]. These main effects were due to decreased reaction times in the level 1 task compared to the other tasks (all p b0.05) and increased reaction times to threat as compared to neutral pictures  Table 1 Reaction times: descriptive data.

There was no signiﬁcant interaction of Task by Emotion [F(2.59, 39) = 2.74, p N0.05].  Analysis of post-scanning arousal and valence ratings of pictures indicated that negative pictures were rate as more arousing (negative: 7.0 ± 0.21, neutral: 1.63 ± 0.17, t = 20.25; p b0.0001) and more unpleasant (negative: 7.9±0.18, neutral: 4.36±0.16); t =16.88; p b0.0001) than neutral pictures.  fMRI data  Main effect of emotion  Across tasks, threatening as compared to neutral pictures induced increased activation in all ROIs except for the posterior insula/S2. Thus, we detected activation for this contrast in the DMPFC (Coordinates of peak voxel [x, y, z]=-1, 40, 41; t=6.31, p b0.05, corr.), VMPFC (x, y, z=1, 39, −6; t=5.93, p b0.05, corr.), dorsal ACC (x, y, z=−5, 18, 30; t=7.07, p b0.05, corr.), rostral ACC (x, y, z=6, 32, 32; t=5.87, p b0.05, corr.), amygdala (left: x, y, z=−26, −2, −6; t=6.48, p b0.05, corr.; right: x, y, z=28, −5, −11; t=5.89, p b0.05, corr.), anterior insula (left: x, y, z=−32, 13, −6; t=6.57, p b0.05, corr.; right: x, y, z=36, 5, 14; t=6.50, p b0.05, corr.), and S1 (right: x, y, z=47, -17, 37; t=4.48, p b0.05, corr.). Fig. 2 illustrates the activation. The activation plots in Fig. 2 show for the right S1 a clear task-related pattern with a systematic increase of activation across tasks.  Parametric analyses  The main aim of this study was to identify areas which showed an association with the task-induced increase of attention to the emotional relevance of pictures. Based on the linear parametric analysis, only the activation in the right primary somatosensory cortex (coordinates of peak voxel [x, y, z]=45, −13, 35; t=4.07, p b0.05 corr.) and in the right posterior insula/S2 (coordinates of peak voxel [x, y, z]=45, −21, 17; t=6.02, p b0.05, corr.) were associated with increasing attention to the emotional relevance of the pictures. The coordinate for the somatosensory cortex is nearly the same as the coordinate for the main effect analysis (see above). Fig. 3 illustrates the systematic increase of activation across tasks in both ROIs.  Discussion  This study investigated the effects of the information processing mode on brain activation to emotional vs. neutral pictures. We used a design in which we kept all experimental conditions constant, with the exception of the task instruction. By means of different tasks, the attentional focus of the participants onto the emotional quality of stimuli and the own emotional involvement was increased systematically across tasks. The results show a main effect of emotion in several areas, including the amygdala, DMPFC, VMPFC, ACC, insula and the primary somatosensory cortex. Most importantly, there was a systematic increase of brain activation with increasing attention to one's own emotion speciﬁcally in the right posterior insula/S2 and the right primary somatosensory cortex.  T.

Statistical parametric maps are overlaid on a T1 scan (radiological convention: left =right). The plot shows the difference of parameter estimates (threat vs. neutral; mean and standard error) for the maximally activated voxel in the ROI.  The results for the somatosensory areas support the notion that these regions are involved in the constitution of emotional feelings, as suggested by theoretical accounts (James, 1884; Damasio, 1999).  Fig. 3. Systematic increase of activation in the right primary somatosensory cortex and right posterior insula/ S2 across tasks. Statistical parametric maps are overlaid on a T1 scan (radiological convention: left=right). The plot shows the difference of parameter estimates (threat vs. neutral; mean and standard error) for the maximally activated voxel in the ROI.  According to this theoretical framework, emotional stimuli evoke bodily responses, which lead to bodily sensations that are represented by the somatosensory and insular cortex. The perception of these bodily changes contributes to the conscious experience of an emotion. Here, we show that increased attention to one's own emotion seems to be associated with increased processing of bodily states during the processing of emotional pictures.  The ﬁndings for the somatosensory areas and the posterior insula were in clear contrast to activation proﬁles in other areas, which did not show a comparable almost linear task-dependent BOLD-signal function. For these other areas, an involvement in different aspects of emotion processing has been proposed. These functions comprise rapid detection of stimuli (amygdala), generation of autonomic responses (amygdala, VMPFC, ACC), general evaluation of stimuli and responses, and initiation and control of emotional responses (VMPFC, DMPFC, ACC) (e.g., LeDoux, 1996; Damasio, 1999; Phan et al., 2002; Ochsner et al., 2004; Straube et al., 2006, 2008, 2009a,b, 2010a,b), which are–at least partially–relevant also during the other tasks. Even though there was also a main effect in S1 and not in posterior insula/S2, this difference was simply due to a threshold effect. Since activation in S1 was stronger across all levels, a main effect was detected. Nevertheless, this effect was clearly based on the systematic increase of activation across tasks.  The current results are in accordance with recent data from lesion studies showing impairments in the recognition and experience of emotions after lesions of the right insula and somatosensory cortex  2538  T. Straube, W.H.R. Miltner / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 2534–2538  (SI and SII) as well as adjacent polymodal regions (Adolphs et al., 2000; Johnsen et al., 2009). However, it should be noted that lesions of the right insula and right somatosensory areas seem to induce rather subtle impairments in emotional tasks and experiences (Adolphs et al., 2000, 2003; Straube et al., 2010b). Thus, it is rather unlikely that emotional experiences are simply based on activation in insular and somatosensory areas. Rather, subjects may use perceived bodily states to infer (the intensity of) their emotions. This might be one important but not the only basis for emotional feelings. The ﬁnal representation of affective intensity might be associated with activation of other areas beyond the somatosensory cortices or the insula, most likely prefrontal areas (Lane et al., 1998; Damasio, 1999; Phan et al., 2004; Straube et al., 2009a, 2010a). Emotional appraisals are strongly context-dependent and even the same intensity of perceived bodily sensations might lead to different emotional feelings depending on further appraisal steps and concurrently activated mental associations (Leventhal and Scherer, 1987). Activation in relevant areas would be therefore rather related to interindividual and trial-related differences in affective verbal responses (e.g., Straube et al., 2009a, 2010a).  It is remarkable that ﬁndings for the parametric analysis were restricted to the right hemisphere. This ﬁnding is in accordance with theories suggesting a dominance of the right hemisphere in emotion processing (see also Adolphs et al., 2000), even though we cannot reject the possibility that our ﬁndings are dependent on valence, since we only used threat-related pictures as emotional stimuli.  It should be noted that we did not ﬁnd a parametric effect in the anterior insula, although the right anterior insula has been proposed being involved in the processing of interoceptive information and emotional states (Craig, 2002, 2009). One explanation is that the anterior insula seems to be generally more responsive to emotional stimulation than the posterior areas across tasks. Furthermore, the absence of a parametric effect in the right anterior insula might be based on the kind of sensations subjects used to decode the stimulus relevance and their own feelings during the brief picture presentation. Thus, with other–rather prolonged or more intense–emotion provoking designs, the subject's attention focus might shift, for example, to their own heart beat (e.g., Critchley et al., 2004), which might result in additional task-dependent activation of relevant more anterior insular areas that are involved in the representation of such sensations. The latter point however is completely speculative and should be investigated in future studies. Future studies could include also selfreport measures to investigate in more detail the subjective attentional focus and the feelings of participants.  In conclusion, our study revealed stronger activation to threatening vs. neutral pictures in several emotion-related regions under different conditions of subjects' attentional focus. However, there was a parametric increase of activation with increasing attention to own emotion speciﬁcally in the right posterior insula and primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, i.e. areas implicated in selfawareness of the own body. These ﬁndings strongly support theories suggesting a role of the perception of bodily states for emotional experiences.

To contrast mechanisms of target selection, distracter ﬁltering, and access to VSTM, we combined behavioral testing, computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Sixteen healthy subjects participated in a change detection task in which we manipulated both target and distracter set sizes. We directly compared the IPS response as a function of the number of targets and distracters in the display and in VSTM. When distracters were not present, the posterior and middle segments of IPS showed the predicted asymptotic activity increase with an increasing target set size. When distracters were added to a single target, activity also increased as predicted. However, the addition of distracters to multiple targets suppressed both middle and posterior IPS activities, thereby displaying a signiﬁcant interaction between the two factors. The interaction between target and distracter set size in IPS could not be accounted for by a simple explanation in terms of number of items accessing VSTM. Instead, it led us to a model where items accessing VSTM receive differential weights depending on their behavioral relevance, and secondly, a suppressive effect originates during the selection phase when multiple targets and multiple distracters are simultaneously present. The reverse interaction between target and distracter set size was signiﬁcant in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), where activity was highest for a single target compared to any other condition. Our study reconciles the role of middle IPS in attentional selection and biased competition with its role in VSTM access.  © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  Competition between targets and distracters for access to visual short-term memory (VSTM) is a central theme in the study of visual attention (Beck and Kastner, 2009; Bundesen, 1990; Bundesen et al., 2005; Desimone and Duncan, 1995; Duncan, 1996; Gazzaley, 2011; Huang and Pashler, 2007; Hung et al., 2005; Kastner and Ungerleider, 2001; Vandenberghe and Gillebert, 2009). Key phenomena underlying visual attention are the limited capacity available for processing information and the selectivity for goal-relevant information (Bundesen, 1990; Desimone and Duncan, 1995; Huang and Pashler, 2007). Studies which address limitations in VSTM capacity typically focus on the quantity of the information stored in VSTM, while keeping constant the  Abbreviations: ANG, angular gyrus; DK rate, don't know rate; DMPFC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; EPI, echoplanar imaging; FEF, frontal eye ﬁelds; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; GLM, general linear model; IPS, intraparietal sulcus; OTS, occipitotemporal sulcus; RTs, reaction times; TPJ, temporoparietal junction; TVA, Theory of Visual Attention; VOI, volume-of-interest; VSTM, visual short-term memory. ⁎ Corresponding author at: Neurology Department, University Hospitals Leuven,  Herestraat 49-Box 7003, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.

Activity in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) correlates with the number of items in VSTM (Todd and Marois, 2004; Xu and Chun, 2006), and with interindividual differences in VSTM capacity (Todd and Marois, 2005). Conversely, studies which address the mechanisms of selection typically vary the quantity and the nature of distracters in the display, while keeping easy the access to the to-be-reported target (Huang and Pashler, 2007). When participants are asked to select a single target among competing distracters, activity in the middle IPS increases (Molenberghs et al., 2008; Vandenberghe et al., 2005), and relates in a linear mode to the number of items (target+distracters) in the display, up to a limit of four items (Mitchell and Cusack, 2008). The ﬁrst objective of the current study was to evaluate the differential effect on IPS activity levels of increasing the number of targets versus distracters in the display.  Selection and access to VSTM can be modeled by the Theory of Visual Attention (TVA) (Bundesen, 1990; Bundesen and Habekost, 2008; Bundesen et al., 2005), a mathematical framework related to the biased competition account (Desimone and Duncan, 1995). TVA deﬁnes selection as a race between competing elements for access to VSTM, with the elements' processing speed being inﬂuenced by  1552  C.R. Gillebert et al. / NeuroImage 62 (2012) 1551–1562  their attentional weight. According to TVA, the ﬁrst K elements that ﬁnish processing are stored in VSTM. TVA estimates individual attentional parameters, such as ﬁltering efﬁciency (α) and VSTM capacity (K), through the use of behavioral data (Habekost and Bundesen, 2003; Hung et al., 2005; Peers et al., 2005). These parameters can be applied to make single-trial predictions of the number of targets and distracters accessing VSTM (Dyrholm et al., 2011b). The second objective of this study was to compare the IPS response as a function of the number of targets and distracters accessing VSTM.  Within a TVA framework we have previously postulated that the middle segment of IPS is involved in attentional selection, i.e. the calibration of attentional weights (Molenberghs et al., 2008; Vandenberghe and Gillebert, 2009; Vandenberghe et al., 2005). This leads us to predict that the IPS activity would not only increase with increasing target set size (Todd and Marois, 2004), but also with increasing distracter set size. Such an activity increase in response to distracter set size (Mitchell and Cusack, 2008; Molenberghs et al., 2008; Vandenberghe et al., 2005) would result from an increased need for attentional selection. Alternatively, however, it could be explained within a ‘VSTM storage’ account: distracters may be stored in VSTM, even though subjects are instructed to ignore them (McNab and Klingberg, 2008; see also Lavie, 2005). TVA is particularly useful in this respect because it explicitly states how both targets and distracters are encoded into VSTM.  Multiple studies have demonstrated that selective attention and VSTM interact at several stages during processing (Gazzaley, 2011; Lepsien and Nobre, 2007; Lepsien et al., 2005, 2011). Here we focused on interactions between attentional selection and access to VSTM. We used a change detection task (Cowan, 2001; Kyllingsbæk and Bundesen, 2009) and a fast event-related design with a very brief retention interval. We independently varied the difﬁculty of access to VSTM and that of selection through the number of simultaneously presented targets and distracters, respectively (Huang and Pashler, 2007). We directly compared the IPS response to an increasing target set size with its response to an increasing distracter set size. We predicted a main effect of both variables. Furthermore, to assess the differential effect of targets and distracters in VSTM, we modeled brain activity as a function of the number of targets or distracters accessing VSTM (latent variables predicted by TVA). By assessing IPS activity in response to target versus distracter set size in the display and in VSTM, we aimed to reconcile its proposed role in selection among competing stimuli (Molenberghs et al., 2007, 2008; Vandenberghe and Gillebert, 2009; Vandenberghe et al., 2005) with its role in access to VSTM (Todd and Marois, 2004; Xu and Chun, 2006).  Material and methods  Subjects  Event-related fMRI experiment  Stimuli were projected onto a translucent screen in front of the subject during scanning by means of a liquid crystal display projector (1024×768 pixels; Barco 6400i; Barco, Kortrijk, Belgium). Eye movements were registered using an Applied Science Laboratory infrared system (ASL 5000/LRO system; Waltham, MA) and stored for subsequent analysis.  Subjects performed a single-probe change detection task under covert attention conditions (Cowan, 2001). A trial started with a temporal warning cue (duration 200 ms) (Fig. 1A). After a short delay (300 ms), a display was presented, showing 1 to 12 white characters (digits and capital letters, size 0.75°) against a black background. The 12 possible stimulus locations were equally spaced on an imaginary circle centered on a ﬁxation point at an eccentricity of 4.45°. None of the 12 equidistant locations was occupied by more than one character. The stimulus display was terminated after 200 ms by an effective mask display (Vangkilde et al., 2011) presented for 300 ms. The mask display showed 12 patterned masks, one in each of the 12 locations. Each pattern was equal in size to a stimulus character and consisted of jumbled letter features. We independently manipulated the number of targets (target set size: 1T, 2T, 4T or 6T) and the number of distracters (distracter set size: 0D, 2D, 4D or 6D) in the display. The selection criterion was based on alphanumerical class (Shibuya and Bundesen, 1988): letters were to be remembered and digits to be ignored. The identity of the targets and distracters was determined by drawing at random from a set of consonants (BCDFGHJKLMPQRSTVXZ) and digits (excluding 0), respectively. The spatial distribution of targets and distracters over the 12 locations was random with the constraint that the number of targets in the left hemiﬁeld was identical to the number of targets in the right hemiﬁeld. The same constraint was applied for the distracters. In trials with only one target, the target was presented equally often in the left and the right visual ﬁeld. The mask was followed by a brief delay (200 ms) during which only the ﬁxation point was shown. Next, a single probe letter was shown at one of the locations previously occupied by a letter (200 ms). In half of the trials, the letter probe was identical to the corresponding letter in the preceding display and in half it was different. Participants were instructed to determine whether the probe letter was identical to the letter at the same location in the stimulus display. Participants held a response box with multiple response buttons in their right hand. Three different responses were allowed: ‘change’, ‘no change’ and ‘don't know’ (unforced choice procedure, Kyllingsbæk and Bundesen, 2009). The intertrial interval was ﬁxed to 3000 ms. Each subject performed 768 trials in total, 48 trials per condition, divided into 6 runs of 128 trials containing 8 trials per condition. In each run, the order of the 16 conditions was pseudorandomized (Wager and Nichols, 2003) and task trials were intermixed with 22 null events.  Sixteen healthy right-handed subjects (mean age 23.4 years, range 20–26 years, eight male and eight female) gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. They had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were free of psychotropic or vasoactive medication and had no neurologic or psychiatric history. Each of them performed the experimental paradigm in the MR scanner (event-related fMRI experiment) and in a psychophysical testing room (behavioral experiment) on two different days within three weeks. The behavioral experiment always followed the fMRI experiment. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee, University Hospitals Leuven.  Stimuli and experimental paradigm  Stimulus presentation and response registration were controlled by a PC running Presentation 11.3 (Neurobehavioral systems, Albany, CA).  Behavioral experiment  Participants were seated at 50 cm from a 19-inch cathode ray tube monitor (resolution 1024× 768 pixels, refresh rate 75 Hz) in a semidarkened room. Gaze ﬁxation was monitored on-line by means of infrared eye monitoring (ViewPoint Eye Tracker; Arrington Research; Scottsdale, AZ).  The stimuli and task were identical to those used in the fMRI experiment, with the exception of exposure duration (13, 40, 80, 120, 160 or 200 ms) in the conditions without distracters. This additional manipulation enabled us to estimate individual attentional parameters related to processing speed and increased the accuracy of the estimates of other attentional parameters (Shibuya and Bundesen, 1988). The manipulation of target set size, distracter set size and exposure duration in conditions without distracters resulted in 36 unique conditions. Each subject performed 1008 trials in total, divided into 7 blocks of 144 trials containing 4 trials per condition. Within each run, the order of the 36 conditions was randomized.  C.R.

Abbreviations: T = targets; D = distracters.  Image acquisition  The fMRI experiment was run in a 3 T Philips Intera magnet with an eight-channel sensitivity encoding (SENSE) head coil. The wholebrain functional scans consisted of T2* gradient-echo echoplanar images (EPI) acquired continuously in an ascending order (6 time series, 225 scans per time series, 2000 ms repetition time (TR), 30 ms echo time (TE), 80× 80 acquisition matrix, 2.75× 2.75 mm2 in-plane resolution, 36 3.75 mm thick axial slices without gap). We also acquired a T1-weighted anatomical image (9.6 ms TR, 4.6 ms TE, 256×256 acquisition matrix, 1× 1 mm2 in-plane resolution, 182 1.2 mm thick coronal slices).  Data analysis  Analysis of behavioral data in the fMRI and behavioral experiments  Analysis of performance across conditions. We determined the proportion of ‘don't know’ trials in each condition. Using the remaining trials, we calculated d′, a bias-independent measure of performance (Macmillan and Creelman, 1991). Trials with reaction times (RTs) more than 3 standard deviations apart from the mean RT of a subject were excluded from the analysis. Don't know rates (DK rates), d′ scores and RTs on correct trials were submitted to a 4×4 analysis of variance (ANOVA) with target set size (1T, 2T, 4T, 6T) and distracter set size (0D, 2D, 4D, 6D) as within-subject factors. When sphericity could not be assumed (Mauchly's sphericity test: P b0.05), P-values were adjusted using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (G-G adj.).  Analysis of eye movements. We deﬁned a region on the display covering the stimulus locations from 3° to 7° eccentricity. Deviations of eye  movements into that region were detected automatically (Molenberghs et al., 2008) and submitted to a 4×4 ANOVA with target set size and distracter set size as within-subject factors.  Maximum-likelihood estimation of individual attentional parameters. Five attentional parameters were estimated using TVA-based modeling (Dyrholm et al., 2011a; Kyllingsbæk, 2006) (LIBTVA software, http://zappa.psy.ku.dk/libtva): (1) t0, the threshold for conscious perception measured in milliseconds, (2) C, the speed of visual processing measured in number of elements processed per second, (3) K, the capacity of VSTM measured in number of elements, (4) α, the ﬁltering efﬁciency deﬁned as the attentional weight of a distracter divided by the attentional weight of a target, where α values close to 0 indicate efﬁcient selection of targets and values close to 1 indicate unselective processing, and (5) ω, one attentional weight per quadrant of the visual ﬁeld, each representing the weight of a target shown in the respective quadrant (αω=the attentional weight of a distracter). The attentional parameters were estimated separately for the behavioral and fMRI experiment using Maximum Likelihood estimation. Since exposure duration was only varied in the behavioral experiment, estimation of K, α and ω in the fMRI experiment was constrained by the t0 and C estimates from the behavioral experiment. A detailed description of the estimation procedure is provided in the Supplementary materials.  TVA-based single-trial predictions. We estimated two latent variables related to the attentional state of each subject on each trial, using his or her attentional parameters derived from the fMRI study: (1) the number of targets selected and stored in VSTM and (2) the number of distracters selected and stored in VSTM. The expressions for estimating these latent variables (see Dyrholm et al., 2011a, Eq. 8) are based on a derivation  1554  C.R. Gillebert et al. / NeuroImage 62 (2012) 1551–1562  which is explained further in the Supplementary materials (but see also Dyrholm et al., 2011b).  Analysis of task-related fMRI data  Preprocessing. Preprocessing and statistical analysis were carried out with Statistical Parametric Mapping 5 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK, http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The EPI images were corrected for differences in acquisition time, realigned to correct for head movements and co-registered to the T1-weighted image. The T1-weighted image was warped into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (via the segmentation option in SPM) and the resulting transformation was used to spatially normalize the functional images. The voxel size of the images in MNI space was 3×3×3 mm3. The images were spatially smoothed with a 5×5×7 mm3 full-width half-maximum kernel. For each of the analyses, we included the 6 motion regressors and a dummy regressor per run. ‘Don't know’ trials were modeled as separate regressor in each analysis.  Targets and distracters in the stimulus display. To evaluate the IPS response as a function of the number of targets and distracters in the display, we modeled the fMRI data using a general linear model (GLM) with 16 main regressors, coding for each combination of target (1T, 2T, 4T, 6T) and distracter (0D, 2D, 4D, 6D) set size. The main effects and the interaction effect were assessed at the second-level with F contrasts and a two-way within-subjects ANOVA implemented in SPM. Main results are reported at P b0.05 with family-wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons at the voxel-level. For clusters of activations in a priori regions of interests, i.e. the middle and posterior segments of IPS (Molenberghs et al., 2008; Todd and Marois, 2004; Vandenberghe et al., 2005; Xu and Chun, 2006), the threshold was lowered to P=0.001 (uncorrected) and a cluster extent of 5 voxels.  Given the complexity of a 4×4 factorial design and the need to evaluate the origin of any interaction effects in a structured manner, we reduced it to a 2×2 design. We modeled the fMRI data using a GLM with 4 main regressors, coding for each combination of the difﬁculty of access to VSTM (difﬁcult access versus easy access: >1T versus 1T) and the difﬁculty of selection (difﬁcult selection versus easy selection: ≥1D versus 0D). We calculated the following contrasts: • main effect of difﬁculty of access to VSTM: >1T minus 1T • main effect of difﬁculty of selection: ≥1D minus 0D • interaction between difﬁculty of selection and difﬁculty of access to VSTM, and the reverse: (>1T,0D minus 1T,0D) minus (>1T,≥1D minus 1T,≥1D) Contrast images were calculated separately for each subject and evaluated at the second-level using one-sample t tests (random effects analysis, threshold: voxel-level uncorrected P b0.001, cluster-level FWE-corrected P b0.05, Poline et al. (1997)). The response proﬁle of clusters showing a signiﬁcant interaction effect was characterized by means of 4 post-hoc contrasts on the peak % signal change, averaged across all voxels in the cluster (one-tailed paired-sample t tests): (1) the simple effect of adding targets in trials without distracters (>1T,0D minus 1T,0D); (2) the simple effect of adding distracters in trials with one target (1T,≥1D minus 1T,0D); (3) the simple effect of adding targets in trials with distracters (>1T,≥1D minus 1T,≥1D); (4) the simple effect of adding distracters in trials with more than one target (>1T,≥1D minus >1T,0D). Statistical signiﬁcance was Bonferronicorrected for multiple comparisons (corrected Pb0.05).  TVA-based estimates of targets and distracters accessing in VSTM. We determined the relationship between brain activity and targets and distracters accessing VSTM in two ways. First, to assess the IPS response as a function of the number of items in VSTM, the fMRI data were modeled using the TVA-based single-trial predictions (latent  variables) of the number of targets and distracters accessing VSTM as parametric regressors (Büchel et al., 1998). For each subject, we created whole-brain contrast images testing for the intra-individual linear relationship between the fMRI activity and the two parametric modulators. As our ﬁrst regressor, we entered the number of targets accessing VSTM and as our second regressor, the number of distracters accessing VSTM. Note that these two variables are highly correlated and that SPM will estimate which portion of the experimental variance can be attributed to the ﬁrst regressor and which portion of the remaining variance to the second. These contrast images were evaluated at the second-level using one-sample t tests (random effects analysis, threshold: voxel-level uncorrected P b0.001, clusterlevel FWE-corrected P b0.05, Poline et al. (1997)). The effect size of the parametric modulators was plotted by means of rfxplot (Gläscher, 2009) (http://rfxplot.sourceforge.net), which is capable of dividing a parametric modulator into different bins containing an equal number of trials, and estimating the average % signal change for each bin.  As our second approach, we constructed a generalized linear model with as independent variables the TVA-based predictions of targets and distracters accessing VSTM for each of the 16 conditions of the 4×4 factorial design, averaged over trials (Figs. 1E–F). The dependent variables were the right and left middle IPS peak % signal change for each of the 16 conditions (Figs. 2D–E). Left and right middle IPS were deﬁned based on the interaction between the number of targets and the number of distracters in the display (Fig. 2C, voxellevel uncorrected P b0.001, cluster extent 5). Our generalized linear model consisted of the linear combination b0+b1 E [Number of targets in VSTM]+b2 E [Number of distracters in VSTM] with a logarithmic link function and Normal noise distribution. The coefﬁcients b0, b1 and b2 then represented activity response per baseline, target, and distracter, respectively. For each subject, we estimated the coefﬁcients b0, b1 and b2. We also computed the residual per condition.  Analysis of interindividual differences in attentional parameters. We investigated whether interindividual differences in VSTM capacity (Todd and Marois, 2005) and ﬁltering efﬁciency correlated with interindividual differences in brain activity. We calculated the Pearson's correlation between K (VSTM capacity) and the peak % signal change in the condition containing a maximum proportion of targets (6T0D), and between α (ﬁltering efﬁciency) and the peak % signal change in the condition containing a maximum proportion of distracters (1T6D). The analysis was restricted to brain areas showing a positive correlation with the number of targets or distracters accessing VSTM, respectively. The statistical threshold was set at P b0.05, Bonferroni-corrected for the number of brain areas.  Control analyses. In a ﬁrst control analysis, we evaluated the consistency of our results with neuroimaging studies reported in the literature, which manipulated either the difﬁculty of access to VSTM (Todd and Marois, 2004; Xu and Chun, 2006) or the difﬁculty of selection (Molenberghs et al., 2008; Vandenberghe et al., 2005). Using a random effects analysis (threshold: voxel-level uncorrected P b0.001, clusterlevel FWE-corrected P b0.05, Poline et al., 1997), we identiﬁed the effect of an increasing target set size in conditions without distracters (>1T,0D minus 1T,0D) and also determined which brain areas were sensitive to the presence of competing distracters when only one target was present in the display (1T,≥1D minus 1T,0D).  In a second control analysis, we compared the response to correct ‘change’ trials (hits) versus correct ‘no change’ trials (correct rejections) (random effects analysis, threshold: voxel-level uncorrected P b0.001, cluster-level FWE-corrected P b0.05, Poline et al., 1997).  In a third control analysis, we evaluated in a whole-brain analysis the effect of increasing number of stimuli on display (random effects analysis, parametric modulation, threshold: voxel-level uncorrected P b0.001, cluster-level FWE-corrected P b0.05, Poline et al., 1997).  C.R.

Results  Behavioral results  Performance across conditions  We examined the behavioral performance during the fMRI experiment by computing a repeated measures ANOVA with 4 levels of target set size and 4 levels of distracter set size (Figs. 1B–D). We observed a signiﬁcant main effect of target set size (d′: F3,45=163.01, P b0.0001; don't know (DK) rate: F1.1,17.2=20.91, G-G adj. P=0.0002; RTs: F1.4,20.6=56.58, G-G adj. P b0.0001), a signiﬁcant main effect of distracter set size (d′: F3,45=43.06, P b0.0001; DK rate: F1.4,21.7= 20.02, G-G adj. P b0.0001; RTs: F3,45=2.93, P=0.04) and a signiﬁcant interaction between target set size and distracter set size (d′: F9,135= 2.56, P=0.01; DK rate: F3.7,55.5=3.08, G-G adj. P=0.03; RTs: F3.1,46.2=4.95, P=0.004) (Figs. 1B–D).  The average number of eye movements toward the peripheral stimuli (mean±standard error of the mean: 0.32±0.08) did not depend on target set size, distracter set size or on the interaction (P>0.18).  The behavioral experiment (Supplementary Table 1) conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant main effect of target set size (d′: F3,42=126.07, P b0.0001; DK rate: F1.2,18.4=29.42, G-G adj. P b0.0001; RTs: F1.6,24.5=47.59, G-G adj. P b0.0001), a signiﬁcant main effect of distracter set size (d′: F3,42=26.66, P b0.0001; DK rate: F1.5,22.1=23.78, G-G adj. P b0.0001; RTs: F3,45=5.77, P=0.002) and a signiﬁcant interaction between target set size and distracter set size (d′: F9,126=4.80, P b0.0001; DK rate: F4.8,71.6=2.40, G-G adj. P b0.05; RTs: F3.9,58.8=2.22, G-G adj. P=0.08).  Individual attentional parameters  We estimated several attentional parameters for each subject using TVA. The estimated capacity of VSTM (K) was 2.62±0.18 in  1556  C.R. Gillebert et al. / NeuroImage 62 (2012) 1551–1562  the behavioral experiment and 2.23±0.08 in the fMRI experiment. On average, subjects assigned a lower attentional weight to distracters than to targets (α toward zero), both in the behavioral (α: 0.28±0.04) and in the fMRI experiment (α: 0.24±0.03). The correlations of the individual parameters between the behavioral and the fMRI session were signiﬁcant for K (r= 0.55, P=0.03) and for α (r=0.52, P=0.04). We used the parameters derived from the fMRI study to compute for each subject the predicted number of targets (Fig. 1E) and distracters (Fig. 1F) accessing VSTM in each trial (see Supplementary Figs. 1A–B for an example).  Task-related functional MRI  Targets and distracters on display  The main effect of target set size was signiﬁcant in the middle segment of left IPS (x, y, z=−21, −69, 51; Z= 4.33; extent 14 voxels at 3×3 ×3 mm3; uncorrected P b0.001) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) (9, 27, 36; Z=5.16; extent 8; whole-brain FWEcorrected P=0.005) (Fig. 2A). The main effect of distracter set size was signiﬁcant in the middle segment of right IPS (27, −54, 48; Z=4.27; extent 39; uncorrected P b0.001) (Fig. 2B). The interaction between target set size and distracter set size was signiﬁcant in the middle and posterior segments of left and right IPS (left middle IPS: Figs. 2C–D; −24, −66, 51; Z=5.32; extent 8; whole-brain FWEcorrected P=0.002; right middle IPS: Figs. 2C,E; 24, −69, 51; Z=3.35; extent 6; uncorrected Pb0.001; left posterior IPS: Figs. 2C,F; −30, −78, 27; Z=3.70; extent 11; uncorrected P b0.001; right posterior IPS: Figs. 2C,G; 27, −84, 36; Z=3.94; extent 15; uncorrected P b0.001).  When the data were analyzed according to a 2×2 design, a similar pattern was observed: increasing difﬁculty of access to VSTM (>1T versus 1T) increased activity in left middle IPS (−21, −69, 51; Z=4.09; extent 40; cluster-level FWE-corrected P=0.001), right frontal eye ﬁelds (FEF) (24, −3, 51; Z=4.59; extent 48; P b0.001) (Fig. 3A, black outline) and DMPFC (9, 27, 33; Z=4.84; extent 129; P b0.001). Increasing difﬁculty of visual selection (≥1D versus 0) increased activity in DMPFC (−3, 33, 39; Z=4.18; extent 30; P=0.001). The interaction between difﬁculty of selection and difﬁculty of access to VSTM was significant in left and right middle and posterior IPS (Fig. 3A; Table 1A): Activity in middle (Figs. 3B–C) and posterior (Figs. 3D–E) segments of left and right IPS increased as a function of target set size when no distracters were presented (>1T,0D in red versus 1T,0D in blue). However, this effect disappeared in the presence of multiple distracters (>1T,≥1D in magenta versus 1T,≥1D in cyan). Likewise, increasing distracter set size increased activity in middle and posterior IPS bilaterally in the case of a single target (1T,≥1D in cyan versus 1T,0D in blue), but this effect disappeared when multiple targets were present (>1T,≥1D in magenta versus >1T,0D in red) (Figs. 3B–E; Table 1A). The same effects were observed in the left occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS) (Figs. 3F–G).  The inverse interaction was signiﬁcant in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) (Fig. 3A): activity was higher for a single target without distracters than for multiple targets and/or distracters (Figs. 3H–I; Table 1B).  To evaluate any differences between left and right middle and posterior IPS (Figs. 3B–C; D–E), we deﬁned volumes-of-interest (VOIs) based on signiﬁcant clusters of activity in the interaction contrast (Table 1A). We analyzed the peak % signal change in these VOIs using an ANOVA with hemisphere (left versus right), VOI (posterior IPS versus middle IPS), difﬁculty of selection (≥1D versus 0D) and difﬁculty of access to VSTM (>1T versus 1T) as within-subject factors. We observed a signiﬁcant three-way interaction between VOI, difﬁculty of selection and difﬁculty of access to VSTM (F1,15=10.8, P=0.005), which did not depend on hemisphere (P=0.93). In the absence of distracters, increasing target set size yielded a stronger activity increase in middle compared to posterior IPS (P=0.001), but had a similar effect on middle and posterior IPS activity when distracters were present (P=0.15) (Figs. 3B–E).

Abbreviations: pIPS/mIPS/aIPS, posterior/middle/anterior intraparietal sulcus; OTS, occipitotemporal sulcus; TPJ, temporoparietal junction.  To evaluate the absence of an effect of early visual cortex activity, we lowered the signiﬁcance threshold to an uncorrected P b0.01. None of the contrasts reached signiﬁcance in early visual cortex.  TVA-based estimates of targets and distracters accessing VSTM  Activity in left and right middle IPS (Figs. 4A–B), FEF and DMPFC linearly increased with the trial-by-trial estimates of the number of targets accessing VSTM (Table 2A). When lowering the threshold to an uncorrected P b0.05, we additionally observed a correlation between the number of targets in VSTM and activity in left (−27, −84, 30; Z=3.69; uncorrected P b0.01) and right posterior IPS (30, −75, 33; Z=2.00; uncorrected P b0.05). Conversely, activity in left and right angular gyri (ANG) (Figs. 4A,C), among other regions, decreased with an increasing number of targets accessing VSTM (Table 2B).  Second, when the average number of targets and distracters accessing VSTM per condition was used as an independent variable, our generalized linear model yielded the following regression coefﬁcients (Fig. 5A) (mean±s.e.m.): left middle IPS: b0 =−0.67±0.15, b1=0.21±0.05, b2=0.13±0.05; right middle IPS: b0=−1.14± 0.24, b1=0.29±0.10, b2=0.18±0.10. This model where targets and distracters accessing VSTM receive differential weights resulted in a moderately good ﬁt (Figs. 5B,D). In conditions however with a relatively high number of targets and distracters accessing VSTM the model resulted in a systematic overshoot (Figs. 5C,E).  Analysis of interindividual differences in attentional parameters  Interindividual differences in storage capacity K were signiﬁcantly correlated with activity in right middle IPS (Fig. 6A), DMPFC (Fig. 6B) and left and right FEF (Figs. 6C–D). No other correlations survived the statistical threshold.  Control analyses  Consistent with previous reports in the literature, a whole-brain analysis conﬁrmed an effect of target set size in middle IPS when the display contained no distracters (Supplementary Figs. 2A–D) (Todd and Marois, 2004; Xu and Chun, 2006), and an effect of distracter set size when the display contained only a single target (Supplementary Figs. 2E–F) (Mitchell and Cusack, 2008; Molenberghs et al., 2008; Vandenberghe et al., 2005).  In order to establish whether or not the results were driven by the match or mismatch between the stimulus display and the probe display (Doricchi et al., 2010), we directly contrasted correct ‘change’ and correct ‘no change’ trials. The activity evoked by a matching probe was signiﬁcantly larger than that evoked by a non-matching probe letter in  right supramarginal gyrus, left and right basal ganglia and right insula (Supplementary Fig. 3). The cluster of activity in right supramarginal gyrus showed a small overlap with 3% (7 voxels) of the right TPJ cluster, but not with the right ANG cluster. The inverse contrast did not yield any signiﬁcant result.  In a third control analysis, we evaluated the relationship between the number of stimuli on the display and the fMRI response amplitude. Activity in DMPFC increased linearly with an increasing number of stimuli on the display (−3, 30, 36; Z=4.92; extent 166; P b0.001). No effects of number of stimuli on display were seen in the posterior or middle IPS, even when the threshold was lowered to an uncorrected P b0.05.  Discussion  While we expected a signiﬁcant main effect of both target set size and distracter set size, we mainly observed a strong interaction between target and distracter set size in both posterior and middle IPS (Figs. 2C–F, 3A–E): adding distracters to the display increased activity in case of a single target, whereas it suppressed activity in case of multiple targets. The activity increase in response to an increasing target set size disappeared in the presence of distracters. The inverse interaction was signiﬁcant in right TPJ, which showed the highest response to target singletons (Figs. 3A,H–I).  Our data cannot be explained by sensory effects arising in early visual cortex. The stimulus array was only brieﬂy presented and immediately followed by an effective mask (Vangkilde et al., 2011) covering all possible stimulus locations (Fig. 1A). As a consequence, we did not ﬁnd effects of target or distracter set size on activity in early visual areas. Furthermore, our principal ﬁndings were based on interaction effects (Figs. 2C–G, 3) and sensory differences are subtracted from the interaction contrasts.  Neither can general effects of task difﬁculty account for any of the parietal response proﬁles: the pattern of accuracy differences between conditions (Figs. 1B–D) was qualitatively different from the pattern of response differences in parietal areas (Figs. 2D–G, 3I). The response proﬁle of DMPFC, with a main effect of target and distracter set size but no interaction, however may reﬂect an increase in task difﬁculty (Barch et al., 1997).  Our estimates of K are lower than those previously reported (Cowan, 2001; Luck and Vogel, 1997). This is likely due to the use of an unforced choice response procedure, which stimulates a conservative guessing strategy and improves the reliability of parameter estimates (Kyllingsbæk and Bundesen, 2009).  1558  C.R.

To maximize sensitivity of the fMRI response for effects of target and distracter set size, we did not manipulate exposure duration during the fMRI experiment. The estimation of the individual attentional parameters (K, α, ωs) during the fMRI experiment was therefore constrained by the perceptual threshold (t0) and processing speed (C) derived from the behavioral experiment. This approach may have reduced the correlations between the attentional parameters and the fMRI response. The strength of the observed correlations (Fig. 6) suggests that the obtained parameters reliably capture individual differences in VSTM capacity and ﬁltering efﬁciency.  Our experimental manipulation revealed a functional dissociation between 3 parietal areas: the angular gyrus (Figs. 4A,C), the right temporoparietal junction (Figs. 3A,H–I), and the posterior and middle IPS segments bilaterally (Figs. 2, 3A–E, 4A–B). ANG belongs to a network of brain areas consistently deactivated in a wide range of cognitive tasks (Buckner et al., 2008), including working memory (Anticevic et al., 2010) and visual search tasks (Shulman et al., 2007). The response proﬁle of ANG in our study was in agreement with these previous reports: ANG deactivation was more pronounced when the number of targets accessing VSTM was high (Fig. 4C).  Right TPJ and IPS responded to increasing target and distracter set size in a qualitatively different manner (Fig. 3I versus Figs. 2D–G). IPS showed activity increases when either targets or distracters were added to the display (Figs. 3B–E). In contrast, right TPJ was selectively activated when a single target was presented in the absence of any other targets or distracters (Figs. 3H–I). In that condition, the sudden onset of a single highly relevant perceptual unit may have captured attention (Yantis and Jonides, 1984, 1990). Under all other conditions, when attention was divided across multiple units in both hemiﬁelds, right TPJ was deactivated or did not signiﬁcantly differ from baseline (Fig. 3I).

Abbreviations: mIPS, middle segment of the intraparietal sulcus.  2002; Vossel et al., 2006) cannot explain the right TPJ activation: expectancy was matched between all conditions. Neither can it be accounted for by differential responses to matching versus nonmatching probes (Doricchi et al., 2010): the activity levels in right TPJ were similar in correct ‘change’ compared to correct ‘no change’ trials. In a previous study, right TPJ activity correlated with the relative saliency of a target compared to other elements in the visual ﬁeld (Mavritsaki et al., 2010). Activity levels of right TPJ are also increased during oddball trials (Braver et al., 2001; Bledowski et al., 2004; Downar et al., 2000). Taken together, these studies provide converging evidence that right TPJ may be involved in ‘spotting target singletons’, deﬁned as targets which markedly and uniquely stand out against the background and are highly dissimilar from any other elements in the visual ﬁeld. In natural vision, right TPJ may be recruited when a unique stimulus stands out against all other stimuli in the visual ﬁeld by being perceptually or emotionally salient (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Corbetta et al., 2008).  With regard to the posterior and middle IPS, the overall response proﬁles were very similar between these two IPS segments (Figs. 2C–G).  There however were some subtle differences: when the display contained multiple targets without distracters, activity levels in middle IPS were higher than when the display contained a single target with multiple distracters (Figs. 3B–C). In posterior IPS, these two conditions closely overlapped (Figs. 3D–E). The posterior IPS segment probably corresponds to what has been called IPS0/1 (Silver et al., 2005; Silver and Kastner, 2009; Swisher et al., 2007; Wandell et al., 2007), a visually responsive area that also shows strong effects of contralateral orienting in the presence of bilateral stimulation (Gillebert et al., 2011; Vandenberghe et al., 2005). Possibly, the posterior IPS segment is involved in attentional enhancement of stimuli within the contralateral hemispace at a more global spatial scale. In contrast, the middle IPS may code for attentional weights at the more speciﬁc level of individual units.  To our surprise, adding distracters to a multi-target array lowered IPS activity levels compared to an array consisting purely of targets. Likewise, increasing target set size abolished the enhancing effect of adding distracters. The resulting interaction between target and  1560  C.R. Gillebert et al. / NeuroImage 62 (2012) 1551–1562  VSTM. Neither did the increased selection demands under these conditions lead to an IPS activity increase, in contrast to our a priori predictions. If the TVA-based VSTM estimates are correct, we have to conclude that during the selection phase multiple targets together with multiple distracters create a suppressive effect on IPS activity over and above any VSTM-related effects. In any case, the need to infer differential weights for targets and distracters within VSTM and the suppression elicited by high target and distracter set sizes call into question the neurobiological validity of the theoretical separation between an attentional selection and a VSTM access phase as far as IPS is concerned.  Monkey electrophysiological studies may shed further light on the middle IPS proﬁle: the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), the putative homologue of human middle IPS (Sereno et al., 2001; Vandenberghe and Gillebert, 2009), contains neurons whose ﬁring rate increases when a relevant stimulus appears in their receptive ﬁeld (Gottlieb et al., 1998), but is suppressed by an irrelevant stimulus (Ipata et al., 2006). Combining enhancement of target representation (Gottlieb et al., 1998) and distracter suppression (Falkner et al., 2010; Ipata et al., 2006) may result in a more sharply demarcated priority map and ultimately in the ability to better discriminate between targets and distracters. Although one has to be careful to infer fMRI response patterns from single neuron data, the middle IPS proﬁle observed here (Figs. 3B–C) may reﬂect the interaction between enhancement and suppression at the level of the attentional priority map.  Other hypotheses could be put forward which we consider less likely as they would require one to modify the TVA-based predictions of targets and distracters entering VSTM themselves. For instance, for an array containing multiple targets and distracters, the threshold for VSTM access may be increased to prevent distracters from entering VSTM. A trade-off may exist between optimal access of targets to VSTM and restricted access of distracters. The optimal balance between liberal access for targets and restricted access for distracters may depend on factors such as the similarity between targets and distracters, the utility of targets for the observer, and the cost incurred by distracters entering VSTM. Such a cost could for instance arise if distracters in VSTM interfere with response decision processes (Allport, 1993). Alternatively, when multiple targets and distracters are present, the selection between targets and distracters prior to VSTM access may consume more resources so that fewer items reach the threshold for VSTM access under these taxing conditions.  Conclusions  Overall, our results reﬂect the interaction between distinct attentional processes of biased competition (Bundesen, 1990; Bundesen et al., 2005; Desimone and Duncan, 1995). Selecting a target for access to VSTM is straightforward when the display contains one target and no other simultaneously competing and equally salient elements. TPJ may then act as a spotter of target singletons, increasing the amount of resources to the unique target stimulus. In contrast, when the display contains both relevant and irrelevant stimuli, particularly with high perceptual similarity, targets and distracters compete for access to VSTM. When multiple targets and distracters are displayed, the simple asymptotic relationship between number of items accessing VSTM and IPS activity levels breaks down. To approximate the IPS proﬁle, elements accessing VSTM needed to be weighted differentially depending on their behavioral relevance (Fig. 5). Furthermore, an additional suppressive effect must be inferred to account for the relatively low activity levels under conditions of multiple targets and distracters. Our empirical ﬁndings call into question the neurobiological validity of the theoretical separation between attentional selection and VSTM access as an account of IPS' response pattern. This reconciles the role of IPS in attentional selection between competing stimuli (Molenberghs et al., 2007, 2008; Vandenberghe et al., 2005, 2012) with its role in VSTM (Todd and Marois, 2004).  Fig. 6. Correlation between brain activity and attentional parameters. Correlation between K and activity in right middle IPS (A), DMPFC (B), left FEF (C) and right FEF (D). The activity is expressed in % signal change in the condition with a maximum proportion of targets (6T0D) relative to baseline. Abbreviations: IPS, intraparietal sulcus; DMPFC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; FEF, frontal eye ﬁelds.  distracter set size (Figs. 2C–G, 3A–E) was an unpredicted and novel ﬁnding. A role of middle IPS in attentional selection between competing stimuli had led us to predict that the activity levels would be highest when selection demands were maximal, i.e. in the presence of multiple targets and distracters. This prediction was only conﬁrmed when distracters were added to a single target. Neither can a simple account in terms of VSTM (Todd and Marois, 2004) account for the IPS ﬁndings (Fig. 1G compared to Figs. 2D–E): Although IPS reﬂects VSTM capacity relatively faithfully when the array exclusively consists of targets, as soon as multiple distracters are added, the linear or asymptotic relationship between the number of units accessing VSTM (Fig. 1G) and the IPS activity pattern breaks down (Figs. 2D–E).  According to the Theory of Visual Attention (Bundesen, 1990; Bundesen et al., 2005), the number of items loaded into VSTM reach ceiling as targets and distracters increase above the maximal individual capacity (Fig. 1G). Assuming that the TVA-based predictions correctly reﬂect VSTM access, an additional operation beyond the mere number of items accessing VSTM (Todd and Marois, 2004) must be invoked to explain the IPS proﬁle. Mathematically, we could approximate the middle IPS proﬁle by giving differential weights to the contribution of targets versus distracters accessing VSTM (Figs. 5B,D). Note that these differential weights for the VSTM phase differ from the attentional weights during the selection phase, which are already incorporated in the estimates of targets and distracters accessing VSTM. But even when we allowed for such differential weighting, the model produced a substantial overshoot compared to the actual middle IPS responses when multiple targets and distracters were present (Figs. 5C,E). Under conditions where multiple targets and distracters are simultaneously present, the IPS response cannot be explained purely based on VSTM: As target and distracter set size increased, activity was suppressed over and above what can be explained by differentially weighted targets and distracters accessing  C.R.

Introduction  Unintentional and uncontrollable processing of threat has been suggested to contribute to the pathology of social anxiety disorder (SAD). The present study investigated the neural correlates of processing task-irrelevant, highly ecologically valid, disorder-related stimuli as a function of symptom severity in SAD. Twenty-four SAD patients and 24 healthy controls (HC) performed a feature-based comparison task during functional magnetic resonance imaging, while task-irrelevant, disorder-related or neutral scenes were presented simultaneously at a different spatial position. SAD patients showed greater activity than HC in response to disorder-related versus neutral scenes in brain regions associated with self-referential processing (e.g. insula, precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) and emotion regulation (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), inferior frontal gyrus). Symptom severity was positively associated with amygdala activity, and negatively with activation in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dlPFC in SAD patients. Additional correlation analysis revealed that amygdala-prefrontal coupling was positively associated with symptom severity. A network of brain regions is thus involved in SAD patients' processing of task-irrelevant, complex, ecologically valid, disorder-related scenes. Furthermore, increasing symptom severity in SAD patients seems to reﬂect a growing imbalance between neural mechanisms related to stimulus-driven bottom-up and regulatory top-down processes resulting in dysfunctional regulation strategies. © 2017 The Authors.

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) describes the pathological fear of negative evaluation by other people. Patients suffering from SAD are characterized by anxiety in social interactions (e.g. small talk on parties, discussions) and performance situations (e.g. giving a speech, job interview) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). With a prevalence rate of 7–13% in Western countries (Furmark, 2002) and 12.1% in the USA (Kessler et al., 2005), SAD is one of the most frequent anxiety disorders. Automatic threat processing, that is, the attentional capture by, and the detection and processing of, threat stimuli that are outside the current attentional focus and/or task-irrelevant (Carretié, 2014; Moors and De Houwer, 2006), is considered a critical factor for the development and maintenance of SAD and other anxiety disorders (Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Morrison and Heimberg, 2013; Öhman and Mineka, 2001). Automatic processing as deﬁned here is often operationalized by engaging participants in a main task with neutral stimuli, while threat stimuli  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Institute of Medical Psychology and Systems Neuroscience,  University of Muenster, Von-Esmarch-Straße 52, D-48149 Muenster, Germany.  E-mail address: carina.heitmann@uni-muenster.de (C.Y. Heitmann).  are presented simultaneously, but remain task-irrelevant (Carretié, 2014). According to biased-competition models, the extent to which task-irrelevant stimuli are processed is strongly mediated by both topdown control and stimulus-driven bottom-up mechanisms (Beck and Kastner, 2009). Thus, unintentional processing of task-irrelevant threat stimuli may be caused by their strong exogenous inﬂuence on attention and enhanced sensory processing (bottom-up), which seems to be associated with increased amygdala activity in anxiety. Additionally, attentional control (top-down) may be reduced, due to altered prefrontal functioning (Bishop, 2008; Connor et al., 2004; Eysenck and Derakshan, 2011; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Öhman, 2005). This imbalance may well be aggravated with increasing anxiety (Bishop, 2009; Bishop et al., 2004b; Cisler and Koster, 2010; Eysenck and Derakshan, 2011), rendering the processing of threat more unintentional and uncontrollable, which represent two important indicators of automatic information processing (Bargh, 1994; Teachman et al., 2012).  Most functional imaging studies on brain responses during automatic processing of task-irrelevant threat stimuli in SAD presented emotional faces, which were judged with respect to emotion-irrelevant aspects such as gender discrimination (Blair, Shaywitz, et al., 2008; Campbell et al., 2007; Gentili et al., 2008; Stein et al., 2002; Straube et al., 2004). Other studies either used gender judgment on stimuli with  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2017.01.020 2213-1582/© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These studies particularly reported amygdala hyperactivation and less consistent hyperactivations in the insula, prefrontal regions (e.g. orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and superior temporal sulcus (STS) in SAD patients, suggesting emotional encoding even when the task does not focus on stimulus valence. These ﬁndings are in large parts compatible to those obtained when attention is not focused elsewhere (e.g. Heitmann et al., 2016; Klumpp et al., 2012; Straube et al., 2005). These studies without attentional restrictions present a neural network including amygdala, thalamus, insula, globus pallidus, ACC, mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, STS, cuneus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), associated with increased threat detection, abnormal self-referential processing and interoception in SAD patients (Brühl et al., 2014; Etkin and Wager, 2007; Freitas-Ferrari et al., 2010; Miskovic and Schmidt, 2012).  However, previous studies on automatic processing in SAD did not use a visually separated feature-based attention task with emotionally neutral stimuli (in the presence of task-irrelevant emotional distractor stimuli), or used emotional stimuli that were only partially relevant for SAD, such as faces (Schulz et al., 2013) or words, which are limited in their ecological validity. Thus, the question arises how patients with SAD process highly ecologically valid disorder-related stimuli, when these are task-irrelevant and presented spatially separate from the task stimuli. This situation, often encountered in real life outside the laboratory, is implemented in concurrent but distinct target-distractor (CDTD) tasks (Carretié, 2014). Previous studies in healthy participants (HC) could show that processing of task-irrelevant stimuli, although presented at a central position, is signiﬁcantly affected by a spatially non-overlapping main task (e.g. Mocaiber et al., 2010; Nordström and Wiens, 2012; Sand and Wiens, 2011; Wiens et al., 2012; Wiens et al., 2011). This task conﬁguration allows to investigate to which degree task-irrelevant emotional stimuli capture attention, and are processed even at task-irrelevant locations (Wiens et al., 2012).  The present study investigated neural correlates of such automatic, disorder-related scene processing in SAD patients and HC. We used visually complex, disorder-related scenes that depict situations SAD patients are afraid of (and neutral control scenes). We used such scenes as task-irrelevant stimuli in an attention-demanding CDTD task. The task-irrelevant scenes were presented at the center of the screen and the emotionally neutral task-stimuli above and below the scene.  Additionally, the inﬂuence of symptom severity was examined with correlation analysis. We expected increased automatic threat processing in SAD patients, reﬂected by hyperactivation in the regions related to affective processing in SAD (amygdala, insula, thalamus, globus pallidus, cingulate cortex, precuneus, STS and prefrontal cortex) (Brühl et al., 2014; Etkin and Wager, 2007; Freitas-Ferrari et al., 2010; Miskovic and Schmidt, 2012), relative to HC (interaction of Scene Type by Group: SAD patients N HC, disorder-related scenes N neutral scenes). Furthermore, we expected hyperactivations in SAD patients to increase with increasing symptom severity. Finally, based on biased-competition models suggesting diminished attentional control depending on interindividual differences in anxiety vulnerability (Bishop, 2008), we expected increasing symptom severity in SAD patients to be accompanied by reduced activation in prefrontal regions.  2. Materials and methods  2.1. Subjects  SAD patients were recruited via public notices, local paper ads and from a collaborating outpatient clinic. HC were selected from a volunteer database of the Collaborative Research Center “Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders” (TRR SFB 58; http://sfbtrr58.uni-muenster.de/) or were  recruited by means of ﬂyers and newspaper ads. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were right-handed (Oldﬁeld, 1971), met the general MRI-requirements, had no history of neurological diseases or psychotic disorders, did not currently take psychotropic medication, and were screened by a psychologist using the standardized clinical interview (SCID; Wittchen et al., 1997). SAD patients fulﬁlled the criteria for current generalized social anxiety disorder according to DSM-IV as main diagnosis. HC were free of any diagnosis. All participants completed the clinician-administered Liebowitz-Social-Anxiety-Scale (LSAS; Stangier and Heidenreich, 2005), Social Phobia Scale (SPS; Stangier et al., 1999b), Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; Stangier et al., 1999a), Fragebogen zur Selbstbeschreibung in sozialen Situationen (FSSS; Kolbeck, 2008), Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory (SPAI; Fydrich, 2003), and Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNE; Vormbrock and Neuser, 1983). To address depressive symptomatology all participants ﬁlled in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Hautzinger et al., 1995).  Out of 33 SAD patients, nine were excluded from statistical analysis due to a BDI score N 30 (n = 2), missing behavioral responses or technical problems (n = 2), misunderstanding of the behavioral task (n = 1), or b90% correct answers in the behavioral task (n = 4). Matched to the 24 SAD patients (17 female), a control group consisting of 24 HC (16 female), who had ≥90% correct answers in the behavioral task, was chosen. Patients and HC groups did not differ in gender, mean age, and educational attainment (see Table 1 for sample details).  Comorbid diagnoses in SAD patients (n = 9, multiple entries possible) were current Major Depression Episode (n = 2), speciﬁc phobia (n = 7), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (n = 1), and General Anxiety Disorder (n = 1). As expected, SAD patients scored higher than HC in all social anxiety-sensitive questionnaires (Table 1). BDI scores were also signiﬁcantly increased in SAD patients, but remained under the clinical signiﬁcance level, and were comparable to scores from other studies (e.g. Straube et al., 2004).  The study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Muenster, Germany. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the experiment. Participants received monetary compensation for participation.  2.2.

Heitmann et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 14 (2017) 323–333  325  and the rating procedure) were used in this study. Disorder-related scenes depict situations SAD patients are afraid of, for example giving a speech, a job interview, a discussion scene, or show persons with bodily symptoms due to anxiety. As in Heitmann et al. (2016), SAD patients in the current study rated the disorder-related versus neutral scenes as more unpleasant, arousing, and anxiety-inducing compared to HC (all P b 0.001, see Supplement ST1 and SF1).  The 50 disorder-related and 50 neutral scenes (with a resolution of 600 dpi, degree of visual angle: 6.3° × 4.73°) were each shown once in the center of a black screen for 800 ms in randomized order. Concurrently, two circles were presented, one above and one below the picture (distance between centers of circles: 7.79°), each with a horizontal or vertical bar inside (see Fig. 1). Participants had to solve a featurebased comparison task (in the style of CDTD-task; Carretié, 2014) and to push the left button on a response box when the bars in the circles had the same orientation, and the right button for bars with different orientation. The presented scenes were irrelevant for the task.  Stimulus presentation and response recording was controlled by Presentation software (version 17.2, Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA). Between stimulus presentations, a white ﬁxation cross was shown for an average time period of 3360 ms (jittered between 1280 ms and 12,200 ms; see Fig. 1). To increase signal discriminability (Dale, 1999), the random stimulus sequence was optimized using the “optimal sequencing” (optseq) algorithm (http://www.surfer.nmr. mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/). The duration of the experiment was approximately 7 min.  2.3. Behavioral data  To assess potential differences between SAD patients and HC in task performance, errors and reaction times (RT) were analyzed.  Incorrect answers, missing responses, trials with contradictory responses, outliers in RT (RT N mean + 2 SD; RT b 300 ms) were counted as errors. Only RTs of correct trials were included and logtransformed to compensate for skewness. Error and RT data were analyzed by means of repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with emotion (disorder-related or neutral) as withinsubjects factor and group (SAD or HC) as between-subjects factor. For the ANOVAs, a probability level of P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Post-hoc t-tests used to resolve interactions were Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons (corrected signiﬁcance level P b 0.0125). Furthermore, correlational analyses between symptom severity and number of errors as well as RTs were conducted. To account for the extensive and comprehensive symptomatology of SAD, a composite symptom severity score was calculated by averaging the standardized (z-transformed) scores in the six social anxiety-sensitive questionnaires used.  2.4. Functional MRI data  Anatomical and functional MRI data were acquired with a 3 T magnetic resonance scanner (“Magnetom PRISMA”, Siemens, Erlangen; GER) using a 20 channel head-neck coil. Functional data were measured using a T2*-weighted echo-planar sequence (TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, matrix = 92 × 92 voxels, FOV = 208 mm2, TR = 2080 ms). 215 volumes of 36 axial slices (thickness = 3 mm, 0.3 mm gap, in plane resolution = 2.26 mm × 2.26 mm) were acquired. To minimize susceptibility artifacts in inferior parts of anterior brain areas, the volumes were tilted approximately 20° from the AC/PC line. A shimming ﬁeld was applied before functional imaging, to reduce external magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneities.

Pre-processing and analysis of functional data were performed using Brain Voyager QX software (version 2.4, Brain Innovation, Maastricht, NL). The ﬁrst ten volumes were discarded from analysis to secure steady-state tissue magnetization. Volumes were realigned to the ﬁrst volume, to minimize effects of head movements on data analysis. No participant showed excessive head movement (N1 voxel). Further data preprocessing comprised spatial (6 mm full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel, FWHMK) as well as temporal (low pass ﬁlter: 2.8 s; high pass ﬁlter: 10 cycles in time course) smoothing. Anatomical and functional images were co-registered and normalized to Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). Finally, volumes were resampled to voxels of 2 × 2 × 2 mm and slice time correction was applied.  Multiple linear regression of the signal time course at each voxel was calculated. The expected blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal change for each predictor was modeled by a canonical doublegamma hemodynamic response function (HRF). In accordance with the behavioral analysis, only trials without errors (see above for deﬁnition of errors) were included in the functional analysis. The two predictors of interest were disorder-related scene and neutral scene (factor Scene Type). First, voxel-wise statistical maps were generated and predictor estimates (beta weights) were computed for each individual. Second, a random-effect group analysis of the individual contrasts was calculated.  Amygdala (dilated 1 mm in radius), insula (dilated 1 mm in radius), thalamus, globus pallidus, cingulate cortex, PFC, STS, precuneus, and cuneus served as Regions of Interest (ROIs), deﬁned a priori according to Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas (Maldjian et al., 2003; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) and transformed into Talairach space according to Lancaster et al. (2007) using ICBM2TAL in Matlab (version 8.2, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). Masks of all ROIs were combined into a single mask. In addition, we conducted an exploratory whole brain analysis to investigate reliable task-related activations outside the ROIs. Furthermore, a correlation between the composite symptom severity score and brain activity in the deﬁned ROIs during processing of disorder-related versus neutral scenes was calculated in SAD patients. To resolve the relationship between amygdala and prefrontal cortex, amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity was correlated with symptom severity in SAD patients. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was performed to explore emotion-dependent connectivity patterns between amygdala and prefrontal cortex in SAD patients for the contrast disorder-related N neutral scenes. The anatomical ROI for left amygdala for this contrast was deﬁned as seed region. PPI analysis was conducted with an interaction regressor that is the product of the HRF-convolved task regressor (psychological factor) and the seed region time course (physiological factor). In a second step, the relationship between amygdala-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity and symptom severity was analyzed by means of correlation analysis. Brodmann areas (BA) for all signiﬁcant activation clusters were identiﬁed with the Talairach client (Lancaster et al., 1997; Lancaster et al., 2000).  Statistical parametric maps resulting from voxel-wise analyses were considered signiﬁcant for clusters that survived cluster-based correction for multiple comparisons. For small-volume corrected analysis, a voxel-level threshold was initially set to P ≤ 0.005 (uncorrected, Lieberman and Cunningham, 2009), for whole-brain analysis to P ≤ 0.001. Cluster thresholds were calculated using a cluster-level statistical threshold plugin in Brain Voyager (Goebel et al., 2006) and carried out across the ROI mask (small-volume correction) and the whole-brain mask. Correction criteria were always based on the estimate of the maps' spatial smoothness and on an iterative procedure (Monte Carlo simulation) used to estimate cluster-level false-positive rates (Forman et al., 1995). After 1000 iterations, the minimum cluster size threshold that yielded a cluster-level false-positive rate of 5% was applied to the statistical maps.  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral data: Scene Type and Group  Analysis of errors yielded neither signiﬁcant main effects nor a signiﬁcant interaction (all P ≥ 0.118). The average number of errors was 5.88 ± 2.071 in SAD patients, and 5.08 ± 1.283 in HC (see Fig. 2). Thus, for both groups, ≥94% of all trials were included in fMRI data analysis. Similarly, analysis of RT in correct trials of the bar comparison task yielded neither signiﬁcant main effects nor a signiﬁcant interaction (all P ≥ 0.144; see Fig. 2). Correlational analyses in patients between the composite symptom-severity scores and number of errors (P ≥ 0.342) or RT (P ≥ 0.403) yielded no signiﬁcant effects.  3.2. fMRI data: interaction Scene Type by Group  Small-volume corrected analysis for the contrast disorder-related versus neutral scenes showed increased brain activation in SAD patients as compared to HC in the insula (BA13), STS (BA13, BA22), precuneus (BA7), and several frontal regions (BA6, BA8, BA9, BA32, BA45; see Table 2; Fig. 3).  Results of the exploratory whole-brain analysis are provided in Table 3. Activation patterns revealed by whole-brain analysis were largely consistent with activation clusters yielded by small-volume corrected analysis. Whole-brain analysis revealed additional activations in temporal lobe (BA13) and parahippocampal gyrus.  3.3. fMRI data: correlation analysis  Correlation analysis of brain activity within ROIs were calculated with a composite symptom severity score in patients, yielding higher activity in the amygdala and decreasing activity in the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC; BA8, BA9, BA10), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; BA32), posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC; BA31), and STS (BA13) with increasing symptom severity (see Table 4, Fig. 4).  To clarify the relationship between symptom severity and brain activation in SAD patients, amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity (seed: left amygdala) was correlated with symptom severity (see Table 5). This analysis yielded a positive correlation between symptom severity and amygdala-prefrontal coupling, with less affected SAD patients yielding more negative coupling, and thus an inverse relation between prefrontal activation and amygdala activation, and more severely affected SAD patients showing rather more positive coupling between these brain regions (see Fig. 5).  4. Discussion  The present study examined the neural correlates of unintentional and uncontrollable processing of disorder-related scenes and the inﬂuence of symptom severity in SAD patients by means of fMRI. For this purpose, SAD patients and HC had to solve a CDTD task (Carretié, 2014), in which the spatial orientation of bars at different screen positions had to be judged. At the same time, task-irrelevant disorder-related or neutral control scenes were presented. SAD patients and HC did not differ in task performance on the behavioral level, so behavioral differences cannot account for differences in brain activation. However, relative to HC, SAD patients exhibited increased activation in the insula, precuneus, STS and in several prefrontal regions during presentation of disorder-related versus neutral, task-irrelevant scenes. Moreover, correlation analysis in SAD patients showed that increasing symptom severity goes along with greater amygdala activity and decreased brain activity in prefrontal regions paralleled by a positive correlation between symptom severity and amygdala-prefrontal coupling. These results suggest enhanced automatic emotional processing of disorderrelated scenes in SAD in a broad neural network. Furthermore, differences in bottom-up and top-down emotional processes seem to be  C.Y. Heitmann et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 14 (2017) 323–333  327  Fig. 2.

In the following, the results will be discussed in detail.  Task-irrelevant disorder-related versus neutral scenes evoked hyperactivations in the insula, precuneus, STS, dmPFC, IFG, and dlPFC in SAD patients compared with HC, as shown by small-volume corrected analysis. These brain regions are considered to be part of the neural network involved in affective processing in SAD (Brühl et al., 2014; Etkin and Wager, 2007; Freitas-Ferrari et al., 2010; Miskovic and Schmidt, 2012). Their activation was observed especially under conditions without attentional restriction during emotional stimulus encoding (Heitmann et al., 2016; Klumpp et al., 2012; Straube et al., 2005), but some regions (insula, STS) also during automatic processing, such as with facial affect in gender discrimination tasks (Blair, Shaywitz, et al., 2008; Boehme et al., 2015; Gentili et al., 2008; Straube et al., 2004). Our results particularly indicate heightened self-referential processing in SAD patients in response to disorder-related versus neutral scenes, although the scenes were task-irrelevant and outside the focus of attention. Insula hyperactivation in particular was often reported in SAD studies (e.g. Amir et al., 2005; Gentili et al., 2009; Straube et al., 2004). It is associated with increased interoceptive processing and awareness of the subjective feeling of anxiety (Critchley et al., 2004; Menon and Uddin, 2010; Paulus and Stein, 2006), both assumed to be key elements in the pathophysiology of SAD (Clark and Wells, 1995; Rapee and Heimberg, 1997). Next to the insula, precuneus hyperactivation in SAD patients can also be interpreted as indicator of increased internal self-presentation and self-referential processing, involving episodic memory retrieval (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006). Note that precuneus activation was reported in SAD patients before (e.g. Gentili et al., 2015a,b; Gentili et al., 2009; Heitmann et al., 2016), but, to our knowledge, not yet under conditions of automatic processing. Together with the precuneus, the dmPFC is assumed to represent a critical structure of the Default-Mode Network (DMN) that plays an important role  in self-referential processing as well as in emotion regulation (Raichle et al., 2001; Schneider et al., 2008). Accordingly, mPFC hyperactivation is a common outcome in studies on affective processing in SAD, and is speciﬁcally attributed to enhanced self-focus and self-relevant memory retrieval (Blair, Geraci, et al., 2008; Gusnard et al., 2001; Heitmann et al., 2016; Moran et al., 2009; Northoff et al., 2006).  In addition to the structures described, which are mainly associated with self-referential processing, the present study also yielded hyperactivation of the STS in SAD patients during automatic disorder-related processing. STS hyperactivation in SAD patients was reported for emotional face processing (Gentili et al., 2015a; Gentili et al., 2008; Straube et al., 2005). STS activation is associated with social perception of visual cues, s in face perception and motion processing (Allison et al., 2000; Hein and Knight, 2008), and in the present study probably indicate the automatic processing of social attributes of disorder-related scenes. However, in addition to attentional capture by social stimulus attributes, STS activation is also taken to reﬂect top-down attentional control during attentional tasks, e.g. during irrelevant emotional face processing (Corbetta et al., 1998; Hopﬁnger et al., 2000; Narumoto et al., 2001; Tseng et al., 2014). Similarly, activations in the PFC, in particular dlPFC and IFG, may indicate that SAD patients engaged in topdown regulation and control of emotion concerning the distracting stimuli, to ensure appropriate task performance. First, the IFG is involved in a wide range of inhibitory cognitive control mechanisms, as required in CDTD tasks (Aron, 2007; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Tabibnia et al., 2011). Next, quite a few studies demonstrated dlPFC activation for emotion regulation and top-down attentional control (Cohen et al., 2000; MacDonald et al., 2000; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). In line with these observations, altered activation in prefrontal regions was reported in SAD, for example during emotion regulation (Brühl et al., 2013; Goldin et al., 2009; Ziv et al., 2013).  Whole-brain analysis supported the results of small-volume corrected analysis, and yielded additional hyperactivations in temporal  Table 2 Signiﬁcant hyperactivations for disorder-related versus neutral scenes in patients suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD) relative to healthy controls (HC) as revealed by small-volume corrected analysis (P ≤ 0.005 uncorrected, and P ≤ 0.05 corrected).

SAD patients display enhanced activation in the insula (z = 14), precuneus (x = 4), superior temporal gyrus (STS; x = 46), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; x = 36), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC; x = 5), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; z = 46) compared with HC.

The often reported amygdala hyperactivation as correlate of initial threat detection during automatic processing (Bishop, 2008; Schulz et al., 2013) could not be conﬁrmed by differential analysis in SAD patients in our study, but emerged in correlation analysis.  Correlation analysis yielded a strong positive correlation between symptom severity and brain activation in the left amygdala. In contrast, symptom severity correlated inversely, thus negatively, with activation in dlPFC, dACC, pMCC, and STS. The amygdala is described as a threat detector of incoming information (Bishop, 2008; Sergerie et al., 2008). It is assumed that amygdala activity contributes to facilitated attention and vigilance potentiation towards the salient stimulus, and to a subsequent  initiation of autonomic and behavioral responses (Janak and Tye, 2015; LeDoux, 2007; Öhman, 2005; Phelps and LeDoux, 2005). These functions of the amygdala explain its role in bottom-up, stimulus-driven processing during uncontrollable and unintentional stimulus processing and studies reporting heightened amygdala activity during automatic processing in SAD patients conﬁrm this (e.g. Boehme et al., 2015; Campbell et al., 2007; Gentili et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2010; Straube et al., 2004). Bottom-up emotional processing is stimulus-focused and depends on stimulus features such as personal signiﬁcance (McRae et al., 2012; Öhman and Mineka, 2001). When differences in bottom-up processing strength are reﬂected by amygdala activation, individual relevance of stimuli should matter. The personal relevance of  C.Y.

This interpretation is supported by studies in SAD patients reporting amygdala activity (Blair et al., 2008) or behavioral indices of attentional bias in dot-probe tasks (e.g. Pishyar et al., 2008; Stevens et al., 2009) to correlate with symptom severity. However, our behavioral data do not support this, since there was no correlation with symptom severity in reaction times, error or rating data. But note also that the reported studies used a different kind of experimental design to investigate attentional bias in SAD. Furthermore, effects of automatic processing are not necessarily observable on the behavioral level (Schulz et al., 2013; Teachman et al., 2012) and the rating procedure unlike the fMRI paradigm required an explicit emotion evaluation.  Biased competition models of attention suggest automatic stimulus processing to be mediated by bottom-up mechanisms as well as topdown attentional control (Beck and Kastner, 2009). Prefrontal regions such as dlPFC, IFG, and ACC are considered highly relevant for attentional control (Aron, 2007; Bishop, 2008; Bishop et al., 2004a; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). In the present study, differential analysis showed hyperactivations of dlPFC and IFG in SAD patients versus HC during disorder-related, task-irrelevant processing, which were interpreted as indicators of enhanced regulatory processing for disorder-related versus neutral scenes. Correlation analysis revealed that for disorder-related versus neutral scenes, prefrontal activation (dlPFC, dACC) decreased with increasing symptom severity in SAD patients. It should be noted that the same regions, which are involved in several executive control functions, also show increased activation in explicitly anxiety-inducing designs (Boehme et al., 2014; Crottaz-Herbette and Menon, 2006; Etkin et al., 2011; Straube et al., 2006, 2007), the role of activations seems to differ depending on explicit and implicit emotional experimental designs. While explicit tasks induce increased top-down processing of highly salient emotional stimuli, more or less adaptive anxiety responses and general behavioral activation, implicit tasks require stronger executive control and inhibition of emotional distractor  processing. Prefrontal activation, including activation in dACC helps to amplify task-relevant activation and to diminish task-irrelevant activation (Bishop, 2008; Crottaz-Herbette and Menon, 2006).  The present correlational results might be interpreted in terms of Bishop's (2008) model, in which decreased prefrontal activation is taken to reﬂect impoverished attentional control of task-irrelevant emotional information. In addition, more severely affected patients might exhibit low abilities to cope with emotional distress, for example by means of attentional control. Both impairments might explain the correlational results, and ﬁt with studies reporting decreasing attentional control with increasing anxiety in HC (Bishop, 2009; Bishop et al., 2004a; Bishop et al., 2007).  Furthermore, prefrontal regions are suggested to mediate emotional processing due to down-regulation of the amygdala (Kim et al., 2011a; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Quirk and Beer, 2006), which might explain the inverse association between brain activity in these brain regions and symptom severity in SAD patients. This assumption is conﬁrmed by the correlation analysis, showing amygdala-prefrontal coupling to be positively correlated with symptom severity, so that less affected SAD patients exhibited more negative connectivity, and more severely affected SAD patients more positive connectivity. Negative connectivity means a negative correlation in activation strength depending on stimulus condition, which might be related to suppression of amygdala activation by prefrontal cortex to disorder-related scenes (Gee et al., 2013). In line with this, less affected SAD patients exhibited even greater amygdala activity for neutral than for disorder-related scenes, which might be a result of down-regulation within the process of effective attentional control. In contrast, positive connectivity would relate to positively correlated activation increases in both regions depending on stimulus condition, and might indicate unsuccessful attempts to (down)-regulate amygdala responses and thus impaired regulatory functioning (e.g. Gee et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2011b).  Some limitations of the current studies need to be mentioned. Performance data did not yield an interference effect in SAD patients,  Table 4 Signiﬁcant correlation of beta-weights (disorder-related versus neutral scenes) with a composite symptom severity score of six social anxiety-sensitive questionnaires in patients suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD) as revealed by small-volume corrected analysis (P ≤ 0.005 uncorrected, and P ≤ 0.05 corrected).

This ﬁnding is not uncommon, and brain-activation data can inform on processing of distractors, even if these distractors do not overtly interfere with the main task.

Heitmann et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 14 (2017) 323–333  331  On the basis of the current fMRI data, it is not possible to decide whether our stimulus arrangement induced one automatic ﬁxation of the scene, or whether participants engaged in several short ﬁxations, for example when switching between the task stimuli. Thus, further investigations are needed to shed light on the speciﬁc mechanisms underlying task-irrelevant threat processing. Eye-tracking would allow to determine whether and how task-irrelevant stimuli are ﬁxated, and what impact ﬁxation has on disorder-related scene processing in a CDTD task design as used here.  Finally, our disorder-related stimuli contain more scenes in which the observer perspective was self-related (i.e. looking over someone's shoulder or being in the situation) than the neutral scenes, which was an intended manipulation. Future studies might investigate whether self-relatedness is a driving factor that is differentially processed in SAD as compared to HC.  5. Conclusions  In sum, results indicate that SAD patients process ecologically valid, disorder-related stimuli automatically, even when these are task-irrelevant and presented at a different spatial location than the task. The higher activations observed in SAD patients point to emotional processing mechanisms associated with particular higher cognitive functions (e.g. self-referential processing, emotion regulation) although the disorder-related stimuli were task-irrelevant. Furthermore, results suggest that increasing symptom severity is characterized by a growing imbalance between neural mechanisms related to stimulus-driven bottomup and regulatory top-down processes that is mediated by an impaired regulatory amygdala-prefrontal coupling.

Introduction  Affective   mentalizing   involves   the   integration   of  various   social   signals   in   order   to  infer   the   affective states   of   others.   Previous   neuroimaging   studies   have   shown   that   the   medial   prefrontal   cortex,   the precuneus/posterior   cingulate   cortex,   and   the   temporo-parietal   junction   constitute   the  core   affective mentalizing   network.   However,   the   relative   contributions   of   these   regions   to  affective   mentalizing   remain unclear.   We   used   functional   magnetic   resonance   imaging   to  investigate   which   of  these   nodes   are   involved in   the   integration   of   two   social   signals:   emotional   tears   and   facial   expressions.   We   assumed   that   this   integration   would   produce   a  supra-additive   effect,   indicated   by   greater   activity   than   the  sum   of   the   effects   of the   individual   social   signals.   Female   subjects   rated   the   sadness   of  faces   with   either   tears   or   tear-like   circles,   and   either   sad   or   neutral   expressions.   We   observed   the   supra-additive   effect   in   the   medial   prefrontal cortex   and  precuneus/posterior   cingulate   cortex   but   not   in   the   temporo-parietal   junction.   These   results indicate   that   the   medial   prefrontal   cortex   and   precuneus/posterior   cingulate   cortex   play   an   important role   in   integrating   tears   and   facial   expressions   during   affective   mentalizing.  ©   2015  The   Authors.

Social  cognition  involves  psychological  processes  that  allow humans  to  make  inferences  about  other  people.  Among  such  processes,  affective  mentalizing  (or  cognitive  empathy)  is  deﬁned  as the  process  of  inferring  another’s  affective  state  (i.e.,  “I  understand  how  you  feel”)  (Perry  and  Shamay-Tsoory,  2013).  Previous neuroimaging  and  lesion  studies  have  identiﬁed  a  number  of brain  regions  involved  in  affective  mentalizing  (Frith  and  Frith, 2003;  Samson  et  al.,  2004;  Saxe  and  Powell,  2006;  Mitchell, 2008;  Shamay-Tsoory  et  al.,  2009;  Atique  et  al.,  2011;  CorradiDell’Acqua  et  al.,  2014).  Among  these  regions,  the  medial  prefrontal cortex  (mPFC),  the  precuneus/posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC), and  the  temporo-parietal  junction  (TPJ)  are  considered  the  core  ∗ Corresponding  authors  at:  Division  of  Cerebral  Integration,  National  Institute   for  Physiological  Sciences,  Okazaki  444-8585,  Japan.

However,  the relative  contributions  of  these  nodes  to  affective  mentalizing  are not  well  understood.  One  possible  way  to  clarify  the  relative  contributions  of  these nodes  is  to  examine  the  brain  regions  that  are  involved  in  integrating  multiple  social  signals  to  infer  another’s  affective  state.  Here, we  deﬁne  the  integration  as  a  process  in  which  social  signals  are combined  to  infer  the  most  likely  affective  state.  In  the  ﬁeld  of multisensory  research,  if  two  different  types  of  social  signal  are integrated  in  a  region,  it  is  expected  not  only  to  be  activated  by each  separately  (convergence),  but  also  to  show  interaction  effects between  them  (Calvert  et  al.,  2000;  Raij  et  al.,  2000;  Stevenson  et  al., 2009).  Previous  neuroimaging  studies  have  consistently  found  that the  mPFC  contains  information  about  another’s  emotional  state, regardless  of  whether  the  social  signals  involved  facial,  body,  or vocal  expressions  (Peelen  et  al.,  2010),  or  whether  they  involved facial  expressions  or  situational  information  in  the  absence  of  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neures.2015.07.005 0168-0102/©  2015  The  Authors.

Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43   33  observable  expressions  (Skerry  and  Saxe,  2014).  These  ﬁndings indicate  that  the  mPFC  plays  a  key  role  in  representing  others’ affective  states  at  the  abstract  level  by  receiving  information  about distinct  social  signals.  However,  each  type  of  social  signal  was   presented  separately  in  previous  studies,  so  it  has  remained  unclear whether  the  mPFC  is  involved  in  the  integration  process.  Even  less  is  known  about  the  role  of  the  PCC  and  TPJ  in  the integration  of  social  signals.  In  particular,  the  function  of  the  PCC in  mentalizing  is  not  well  understood;  hence,  little  attention  has been  paid  to  its  role  in  integrating  social  signals.  Furthermore,  the function  of  the  TPJ  in  mentalizing  has  been  controversial  (Decety and  Lamm,   2007;  Mitchell,  2008;  Scholz  et  al.,  2009;  Cabeza  et  al., 2012),  and  its  role  in  the  integration  of  social  signals  has  not been  clariﬁed.  For  instance,  Peelen  et  al.  (2010)  showed  that  a region  adjacent  to  the  TPJ  also  contains  information  about  another’s emotional  state  across  different  types  of  emotional  expression (face,  body,  and  voice).  However,  a  subsequent  neuroimaging  study by  Skerry  and  Saxe  (2014)  utilizing  facial  expressions  and  situational  information  (e.g.,  social  exclusion)  showed  that  the  TPJ did  not  represent  another’s  emotional  state  at  an  abstract  level; more  speciﬁcally,  their  work  showed  that  a  classiﬁer,  which  was trained  to  discriminate  the  valence  of  one  social  signal  within the  TPJ,  did  not  successfully  classify  that  valence  for  the  other social  signals.  Understanding  another  person’s  affective  state  based on  situational  information  is  critically  different  from  interpreting emotional  expressions  (produced  by  the  face,  body,  and  voice),  in that  situational  information  can  be  interpreted  in  multiple  ways and  presents  an  ill-posed  inverse  problem  (e.g.,  a  person  might feel  happy  or  sad  when  he  or  she  is  separated  from  others).  Thus, understanding  situational  information  in  a  socially-appropriate manner  requires  knowledge  of  the  social  event  (e.g.,  that  separation  from  others  should  be  considered  a  sad  event;  Barbey  et  al., 2009;  Krueger  et  al.,  2009).  Thus,  we  anticipate  that  the  TPJ  plays a  minor  role  in  the  integration  of  social  signals  that  involve  social event  knowledge.  Given  this  background,  we  focused  our  investigation  on  the  integration  of  two  social  signals  from  facial  stimuli:  tears  and  facial expressions.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  neither  the  neural  mechanisms  underlying  the  processing  of  tears  as  social  stimuli  nor  the neural  bases  of  the  integration  of  tears  and  facial  expressions  has been  identiﬁed.  Emotional  tears  appear  to  be  unique  to  humans  and are  of  considerable  interest  in  the  ﬁeld  of  evolutionary  psychology (e.g.,  Murube  et  al.,  1999;  Provine  et  al.,  2009;  Balsters  et  al.,  2013). Like  social  situations,  understanding  another’s  affective  state  from tears  is  an  ill-posed  inverse  problem,  because  tears  can  be  shed  in response  to  many  different  emotions  (e.g.,  anger,  happiness,  and sadness;  Murube  et  al.,  1999).  Therefore,  tears  are  similar  to  social situations  in  that  they  require  social  event  knowledge  in  order  to achieve  the  most  appropriate  interpretation.  In  the  absence  of  contextual  information,  humans  tend  to  interpret  tears  as  a  symbol  of sadness  (i.e.,  the  tears  effect;  Provine  et  al.,  2009),  possibly  because such  an  interpretation  is  the  most  socially  appropriate.  As  the  mPFC can  represent  others’  emotions  at  an  abstract  level  across  different  social  signals  (Peelen  et  al.,  2010;  Skerry  and  Saxe,  2014),  we predicted  that  it  would  be  involved  in  integrating  tears  and  facial expressions.  The  present  study  used  functional  magnetic-resonance  imaging (fMRI)  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  the  mPFC,  but  not  the  TPJ,  integrates  tears  and  facial  expressions  during  the  evaluation  of  others’ sadness.  We   also  explored  the  role  of  the  PCC  in  this  integration process  without  a  speciﬁc  hypothesis.  We   manipulated  two  factors:  tears  (tears,  tear-like  control  objects,  and  no  object)  and  facial expressions  (sad  and  neutral).  We   initially  tested  our  assumption that  the  core  mentalizing  network  is  activated  by  the  presence  of tears,  and  then  examined  whether  this  network  shows  interaction effects  between  tears  and  facial  expressions.  We   predicted  that  the  mPFC  would  show  a  supra-additive  effect,  providing  evidence of  the  integration  of  information  on  tears  and  facial  expressions (Meredith  and  Stein,  1983;  Calvert  et  al.,  2000;  Raij  et  al.,  2000; Stevenson  et  al.,  2009).  In  other  words,  these  regions  should  show stronger  activation  in  response  to  a  sad  facial  expression  with  tears than  the  sum  of  the  activity  in  response  to  individual  presentations of  a  sad  facial  expression  without  tears  and  a  neutral  facial  expression  with  tears.  By  contrast,  we   predicted  that  the  TPJ  would  not show  the  same  effect.  2.  Materials  and  methods  2.1.  Subjects  Sixty-one  healthy  subjects  aged  18–44  years  (mean  age  =  22.1 years;  standard  deviation  [SD]  =  4.7  years)  participated  in  the  study. We  recruited  only  female  participants  because  they  tend  to  react to  crying  people  with  more  sympathy  and  support  than  males (Cretser  et  al.,  1982).  All  subjects  were  right-handed  according  to the  Edinburgh  Handedness  Inventory  (Oldﬁeld,  1971).  None  of  the volunteers  had  a  history  of  symptoms  requiring  neurological,  psychological,  or  other  medical  care.  All  subjects  gave  written  informed consent.  The  study  was  approved  by  the  ethical  committee  of  the National  Institute  for  Physiological  Sciences  of  Japan.  Thirty-eight subjects  participated  in  the  main  fMRI  experiment.  The  rest  of  the subjects  (n  =  23)  participated  in  a  separate  experiment  to  deﬁne  the regions  of  interest  (ROIs).  None  of  the  subjects  participated  in  both experiments.  2.2.  Data  acquisition  fMR   images  were  acquired  using  a  3T  scanner  (Verio;  Siemens Erlangen,  Germany)  with  a  32-element  phased-array  head  coil. Tight  but  comfortable  foam  padding  was  placed  around  each  subject’s  head  to  minimize  movement.  T2*-weighted  gradient-echo echo-planar  imaging  (EPI)  was   used  to  obtain  the  functional  images. The  sequence  parameters  were  as  follows:  repetition  time  (TR), 3000  ms;   echo  time  (TE),  30  ms;   ﬂip  angle,  83◦;  39  slices  of  3.0  mm thickness  with  a  17%  slice  gap,  which  covered  the  entire  cerebral and  cerebellar  cortices;  ﬁeld  of  view,  192  mm;   and  in-plane  resolu× tion,  3.0  mm    3.0  mm.   Oblique  scanning  was  used  to  exclude  the eyeballs  from  the  images.  For  anatomical  imaging,  a  T1-weighted three-dimensional  (3D)  magnetization-prepared  rapid-acquisition gradient  echo  (MP-RAGE)  sequence  was   obtained  (TR  =  1800  ms; TE  =  2.97  ms;   ﬂip  angle  =  9◦;  ﬁeld  of  view  =  250  mm;   and  voxel dimensions  =  0.9  mm   ×   1.0  mm).  ×   0.9  mm   2.3.  Stimuli  We  used  six  types  of  face:  those  portraying  sad  facial  expressions with  tears,  with  tear-like  circles,  and  without  tears;  and  those  portraying  neutral  facial  expressions  with  tears,  with  tear-like  circles, and  without  tears  (Fig.  1A).  Stimuli  were  produced  as  described below.  2.3.1.  Stimuli  production  We   followed  the  same  procedure  as  Provine  et  al.  (2009)  to produce  the  stimuli.  We   initially  obtained  90  images  of  faces  with tears  (Tears  images)  from  the  online  image  archives  Flickr  (www. ﬂickr.com)  and  Google  (www.google.co.jp).  We   limited  our  search to  images  of  female  adults  in  order  to  eliminate  gender  differences between  the  subjects  and  stimuli.  In  addition  to  facial  images,  we also  collected  45  landscape  images  from  Flickr  to  use  as  controls.  We   removed  the  tears  from  the  90  face  images  using  photoediting  software  (Adobe  Photoshop,  Adobe  Systems  Inc.,  San  Jose, CA)  and  deﬁned  them  as  NoTears  images.  We   then  produced  new  34   H.K.  Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43  Fig.  1.  Experimental  design.  (A)  Task  designs.  We  adopted  a  within-subjects  factorial  design  with  two  factors:  Tears  and  Facial  expression.  We  extended  the  task  design  of Provine  et  al.  (2009)  by  including  two  levels  of  facial  expressions  (Sad  and  Neutral)  and  three  levels  of  Tears  (Tears,  Circles,  and  NoTears).  Note  that  due  to  copyright  issues these   are  schematics  rather  than  the  actual  stimuli.  (B)  Task  schedule.  We   used  conventional  block  designs  in  which  three  trials  of  the  same  condition  (with  different  pictures) were   repeated  three  times  in  a  block  (18  s).  The  order  of  conditions  was   pseudo-randomized.  In  each  trial  (6  s),  the  subject  viewed  the  face  picture  for  3.5  s  and  evaluated  the extent  of  sadness  of  the  person  for  2.5  s.  images  by  adding  gray  circles  to  the  NoTears  images,  resulting  in  the Circles  images.  The  location  and  the  number  of  gray  circles  in  the Circles  images  were  matched  with  the  location  and  number  of  tears in  the  original  (Tears)  images.  We   did  not  include  natural  objects on  stimuli  (e.g.,  scars  or  saliva)  in  order  to  match  the  locations  of stimuli  and  to  avoid  any  possible  interpretation  of  affective  states (e.g.,  the  observed  person  is  hungry  because  of  saliva  on  the  face). Collectively,  we  created  three  sets  of  facial  images  (comprising  270 images  in  total):  90  Tears  images,  90  NoTears  images,  and  90  Circles images.  The  mean  differences  in  size  and  perceived  brightness  of the  images  for  each  condition  were  minimized  using  photo-editing software  (Adobe  Photoshop,  Adobe  Systems  Inc.,  San  Jose,  CA).  We  further  categorized  each  set  of  images  into  two   subsets (sad  and  neutral)  based  on  their  facial  expressions.  Eight  females, who  did  not  participate  in  the  fMRI  experiment,  rated  the  intensity of  sadness  in  the  images  on  a  visual  analog  scale  (VAS)  ranging  from  0  (“not  sad  at  all”)  to  100  (“extremely  sad”).  Initially,  we used  the  VAS  scores  from  the  same  eight  subjects  to  classify  the 90  NoTears  images  into  45  images  of  “sad”  expressions  and  45 images  of  “neutral”  expressions.  Then,  the  Tears  and  Circles  images were  categorized  into  “sad”  and  “neutral”  images;  the  images  for each  facial  expression  were  identical  except  for  the  presence  of tears  or  circles.  In  total,  we  produced  seven  types  of  image:  sad facial  expressions  with  tears  (Sad  Expression  +  Tears  [ST]  images), sad  facial  expressions  without  tears  (Sad  Expression  [S]  images), sad  facial  expressions  with  circles  (Sad  Expression  +  Circles  [SC] images),  neutral  facial  expressions  with  tears  (Neutral  +  Tears  [NT] images),  neutral  faces  without  tears  (Neutral  [N]  images),  neutral faces  with  circles  (Neutral  +  Circles  [NC]  images),  and  landscape images  (Baseline  [B]  images)  (Fig.  1A).  Fig.  1  shows  schematic  drawings  of  representative  stimuli  due  to  copyright  issues.  Each  image was  used  only  once  in  each  experiment.  H.K.  Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43   35  2.3.2.  Stimulus  presentation  Stimuli  were  back-projected  via  a  liquid  crystal  display  (LCD) projector  (CP-SX12000;  Hitachi,  Ltd.,  Tokyo)  onto  a  translucent screen  located  at  the  rear  of  the  scanner.  The  horizontal  and  vertical  viewing  angles  of  stimuli  were  5.3◦ and  7.4◦,  respectively.  The subjects  viewed  stimuli  via  a  mirror  placed  above  the  head  coil.  We used  Presentation  software  to  display  visual  stimuli  and  record  the subject’s  response  (Neurobehavioral  Systems,  Inc.,  San  Francisco, CA).  2.4.  Task  design  and  procedure  A  two-factor  within-subjects  factorial  design  was  used,  with  two levels  of  Facial  Expressions  (Sad  and  Neutral)  and  three  levels  of Tears  (Tears,  NoTears  and  Circles)  (Fig.  1A).  In  addition  to  these six  conditions,  we  included  a  baseline  (B)  condition,  during  which subjects  observed  landscape  images.  We   employed  a  conventional  block  design  (Fig.  1B)  with  ﬁve runs.  Each  run  consisted  of  the  ﬁrst  12  scan  volumes,  followed  by 23  blocks  that  lasted  for  18  s  (6  volumes  per  block),  and  the  ﬁnal × 6  volumes  (12  volumes  +  [23  blocks    6  volumes]  +  6  volumes  =  156 volumes  per  run).  Each  block  included  one  of  the  seven  task  conditions,  and  each  condition  was  repeated  three  times  (21  blocks). Each  block  included  three  trials  of  the  same  condition,  and  each × trial  lasted  6  s  (3  blocks    5  runs  =  45  trials  for each  condition  in  total).  The  order  of  the  conditions  was  pseudorandomized  in  each  repetition.  In  addition,  we  included  two  blocks of  the  rest  condition:  one  between  the  last  block  of  the  ﬁrst  repetition  of  a  condition  and  the  ﬁrst  block  of  the  second  repetition;  and the  other  between  the  last  block  of  the  second  repetition  and  the ﬁrst  block  of  the  third  repetition  (2  rest  blocks  +  21  task  blocks  =  23 blocks  in  total).  ×   3  trials  per  block   In  each  trial,  an  image  was  presented  for  3.5  s,  followed  by  the presentation  of  a  visual  analog  scale  (VAS)  for  2.5  s.  The  subjects used  the  VAS  to  evaluate  the  extent  of  sadness  of  the  presented facial  stimuli.  The  subjects  manipulated  a  two-button  response × box  (HHSC-2    2,  Current  Designs,  Inc.,  Philadelphia,  PA)  with  their right  hand  to  specify  the  location  of  the  vertical  line  on  a  VAS  (the index  ﬁnger  moved  the  line  to  the  left,  and  the  middle  ﬁnger  moved the  line  to  the  right).  The  VAS  scale  consisted  of  a  white-colored horizontal  bar  with  each  end  indicating  the  minimum  (i.e.,  not  sad at  all)  and  the  maximum  (i.e.,  extremely  sad)  of  the  intensity  of sadness  expressed  by  the  image.  The  end  of  the  minimum  and  maximum  was  counterbalanced  across  the  subjects.  In  the  baseline  (B) condition,  the  subject  was  asked  to  move  the  VAS  to  any  position they  wished.  All  of  the  subjects  performed  several  practice  trials in  order  to  familiarize  them  with  the  task  and  to  ensure  they  were able  to  utilize  the  VAS  easily.  2.5.  Imaging  data  processing  The  ﬁrst  six  volumes  of  each  fMRI  run  were  discarded  for  stabilization  of  the  magnetization,  and  the  remaining  150  volumes  per run  (a  total  of  750  volumes  per  participant)  were  used  for  analysis.  Image  processing  and  statistical  analyses  were  performed  using the  Statistical  Parametric  Mapping  (SPM8)  package  (Friston  et  al., 2007).  The  images  were  realigned  to  correct  for  head  motion,  then corrected  for  differences  in  slice  timing  within  each  volume.  After the  T1-weighted  anatomical  images  were  segmented  into  different  tissue  classes,  each  subject’s  T1-weighted  anatomical  image was  co-registered  with  the  mean  image  of  all  of  the  EPI  images for  each  subject.  Each  co-registered  T1-weighted  anatomical  image was  normalized  to  the  Montreal  Neurological  Institute  T1  image template  (ICBM  152)  (Evans  et  al.,  1994;  Friston  et  al.,  1995).  The parameters  from  this  normalization  process  were  then  applied  to each  functional  image.  The  spatially  normalized  EPI  images  were  ﬁltered  using  a  Gaussian  kernel  of  8  mm  full  width  at  half  maximum   (FWHM)  in  the  x,  y,  and  z  axes  (ﬁnal  smoothness:  x  =  11.8, y  =  11.9,  and  z  =  11.8  mm).   The  parameters  from  this  normalization process  were  then  applied  to  the  functional  images,  which  were resampled  to  a  ﬁnal  resolution  of  2   ×   2  mm3.  ×   2   2.6.  Statistical  analyses  2.6.1.  Individual  analyses  A  design  matrix  comprising  the  ﬁve  runs  was  prepared  for  each subject.  We   ﬁtted  a  general  linear  model  (GLM)  to  the  fMRI  data for  each  subject  (Friston  et  al.,  1994a;  Worsley  and  Friston,  1995). Neural  activity  during  each  condition  was  modeled  with  box-car functions  convolved  with  the  canonical  hemodynamic-response function.  Each  run  included  seven  task-related  regressors,  one  for each  condition.  The  time  series  for  each  voxel  was  high-pass  ﬁltered  at  1/128  Hz.  Assuming  a  ﬁrst-order  autoregressive  model, the  serial  autocorrelation  was   estimated  from  the  pooled  active voxels  with  the  restricted  maximum  likelihood  (ReML)  procedure, and  was  used  to  whiten  the  data  (Friston  et  al.,  2002).  Motionrelated  artifacts  were  minimized  by  incorporating  six  parameters (three  displacements  and  three  rotations)  from  the  rigid-body realignment  stage  into  each  model.  The  parameter  estimates  for each  condition  in  each  individual  were  compared  using  linear contrasts.  After  conﬁrming  face-related  activation  (e.g.,  activation in  the  fusiform  gyrus)  by  comparing  face  conditions  with  baseline  (B),  we   evaluated  the  following  contrasts  (Table  1):  ﬁrst, − Tears  minus  NoTears,  [(ST  +  NT)    (S  +  N)];  second,  Tears  minus  Cir− cles,  [(ST  +  NT)    (SC  +  NC)];  third,  Sad  minus  Neutral  expressions, − [(ST  +  S  +  SC)    (NT  +  N  +  NC)];  and  fourth,  the  interaction  effects, − − −   SC)].  The  supra  NC)]  and    (NT  [(ST  − − additive  effect  was   tested  by  the  contrast  of  [(ST    NC)]   SC)  (i.e.,  (ST   −   SC)  −   NC)  >  (SC   [(NT  −   NC)).  −   NC)  +  (NT   −   NC)   −   (ST   −   (NT   2.6.2.  Random-effects  group  analysis  In  the  ﬁrst-level  analysis,  we   obtained  images  that  represent  the normalized  task-related  increment  of  the  MR   signal  of  each  subject for  each  predeﬁned  contrast  (i.e.,  contrast  images).  These  contrast images  were  used  for  the  group  analysis.  For  each  predeﬁned  contrast  (Table  1),  a  one-sample  t-test  was  performed  for  every  voxel in  the  brain  to  obtain  population  inferences  (Holmes  and  Friston, 1998).  The  resulting  set  of  voxel  values  for  each  comparison  constituted  an  SPM  of  the  t  statistic  SPM{t}.  The  height  threshold  for  the SPM{t}   was  set  at  t(37)  >  2.72,  equivalent  to  p  <  0.005  uncorrected. The  statistical  threshold  for  the  spatial  extent  test  on  the  clusters was  set  at  p  <  0.05  and  corrected  for  multiple  comparisons  (familywise  error  [FWE])  over  the  whole  brain  (Friston  et  al.,  1994b,  1996). Brain  regions  were  anatomically  deﬁned  and  labeled  according to  probabilistic  atlases  (Amunts  et  al.,  2005;  Eickhoff  et  al.,  2005; Shattuck  et  al.,  2008)  and  a  previous  meta-analysis  study  (Van Overwalle,  2009).  In  order  to  avoid  the  ambiguity  of  the  anatomical  location  of  the  TPJ,  we   deﬁned  it  as  the  angular  gyrus  (Saxe and  Powell,  2006;  Scholz  et  al.,  2009;  Cabeza  et  al.,  2012).  Consistent  with  a  meta-analysis  (Van  Overwalle,  2009),  we   deﬁned  the mPFC  as  the  medial  wall  of  the  prefrontal  cortex:  that  is,  regions −20  to  20  and  the  y  coorin  which  the  x  coordinates  ranged  from  dinates  were  above  y  >  20  in  MNI   space  (Van  Overwalle,  2009).  We further  subdivided  the  mPFC  into  three  regions  (Van  Overwalle, 2009):  the  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC),  which  lies  above the  z  coordinate  of  20  mm;   the  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex −15  and  z  =  20  mm;   and  the  medial (vmPFC),  which  lies  between  z  =  orbitofrontal  cortex  (mOFC),  which  lies  below  z  =   −15  mm.  2.6.3.  ROI  analysis  After  the  whole-brain  analysis  was   completed,  we   conducted ROI  analysis.  The  assumption  was   that  the  supra-additive  effect  of  36   Table  1 Predeﬁned  contrasts.

Thus,  we  deﬁned  ROIs  based  on  the  brain  regions that  were  activated  by  the  Tears  condition  relative  to  the  NoTears condition.  The  use  of  the  same  dataset  for  the  deﬁnition  of  ROI  and  analysis of  response  patterns  in  the  ROI  can  lead  to  invalid  statistical  inferences  (i.e.,  the  double-dipping  problem;  Kriegeskorte  et  al.,  2009). To  avoid  this,  we  conducted  a  separate  experiment  to  compare  the Tears  condition  with  the  NoTears  condition,  as  described  below.  The  design  and  analyses  of  this  experiment  were  identical  to the  main  experiment  except  that  the  Circles  conditions  (SC  and  NC) × were  removed  (3  blocks  for  each  condition    5  conditions  +  2  rest blocks  =  17  blocks).  We   collected  9  volumes  before  the  ﬁrst  block × and  7  volumes  after  the  last  block  (9  +  [17  blocks    6]  +  7  =  118  volumes  per  run).  The  threshold  for  the  SPM{t}   was  set  at  t(22)  >  2.82 (equivalent  to  p  <  0.005  uncorrected,  which  was  the  same  height threshold  as  that  in  the  main  experiment).  The  statistical  threshold for  the  spatial  extent  test  on  the  clusters  was  set  at  p  <  0.05  and corrected  for  multiple  comparisons  (FWE)  over  the  whole  brain (Friston  et  al.,  1994b,  1996).  We  evaluated  only   the  Tears  minus  NoTears  contrast − [(ST  +  NT)    (S  +  N)].  We   chose  the  peak  coordinates  in  each  cluster in  the  mPFC,  PCC,  and  TPJ.  A  cluster  of  activation  could  include anatomical  regions  beyond  our  hypothesis  (e.g.,  the  fusiform  gyrus in  the  TPJ  ROI).  In  order  to  limit  the  ROIs  to  each  hypothesized region,  we  calculated  the  overlap  between  the  cluster  activated by  the  Tears  effect  and  a  12-mm-radius  sphere  with  the  peak coordinates  of  the  same  cluster.  This  radius  was  identical  to  the effective  resolution  (ﬁnal  smoothness)  of  the  statistical  parametric maps.  This  overlapping  region  in  each  cluster  was  used  as  the  ROI. We  analyzed  the  data  from  the  main  experiment  based  on  these ROIs.  We   used  unsmoothed  data  in  order  to  characterize  activation  patterns  without  blurring  and  to  maximize  the  sensitivity.  We averaged  the  contrast  estimates  in  all  voxels  within  each  ROI  and compared  them  between  the  four  conditions  of  interest  (ST,  SC,  NT, and  NC).  3.  Results  3.1.

Finally,  we   found  that  the  Circles  condition  showed greater  VAS  rating  scores  than  the  NoTears  condition  for  neutral expressions  (p  <  0.01),  but  not  for  sad  facial  expressions  (p  >  0.9).  Taken  together,  these  ﬁndings  conﬁrm  that  the  presence  of  tears  increased  the  sadness  ratings  (Provine  et  al.,  2009).  3.2.   fMRI  results  3.2.1.  Whole-brain  analysis 3.2.1.1.  The  main  effect  of  tears.  We   conducted  the  two  contrasts to  evaluate  the  brain  regions  by  the  presence  of  tears:  that  is,  the contrast  with  a  liberal  control  (NoTears)  and  a  stringent  control − (Circles).  The  contrast  of  Tears  minus  NoTears  [(ST  +  NT)    (S  +  N)] revealed  regions  of  signiﬁcant  activation  bilaterally  in  the  vmPFC, mOFC,  posterior  cingulate  gyrus,  TPJ,  superior  parietal  lobule,  superior,  middle  and  inferior  occipital  gyri,  middle  and  inferior  temporal gyri,  fusiform  gyrus,  and  caudate  nucleus  (Fig.  3  and  Table  2).  In addition,  the  same  contrast  revealed  signiﬁcant  activation  in  the  left hemisphere:  speciﬁcally,  in  the  dmPFC,  precuneus,  middle  frontal gyrus,  superior  temporal  gyrus,  amygdala,  hippocampus  and  brainstem.  The  contrast  of  Tears  minus  Circles  [(ST  +  NT)   revealed  no  signiﬁcant  activation.  −   (SC  +  NC)]  levels  of  Facial  Expressions   The  presence  of  tears  on  the  face  images  increased  the  VAS ratings  of  sadness  (Fig.  2).  A  two-way  repeated-measures  anal× ysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  (2    3 levels  of  Tears)  on  the  rating  scores  revealed  signiﬁcant  main effects  of  Facial  Expressions  [F(1,  37)  =  635.8,  p  <  0.001]  and  of Tears  [F(2,  74)  =  142.5,  p  <  0.001],  and  a  signiﬁcant  interaction [F(2,  74)  =  94.2,  p  <  0.001].  Post  hoc  pair-wise  comparisons  (with  a Bonferroni  correction)  showed  that  there  were  greater  VAS  ratings in  the  Tears  condition  compared  with  the  NoTears  and  Circles conditions  for  each  facial  expression  (p  values  <  0.001).

By  contrast,  activity  in  the  TPJ  showed  only  the  main effect  of  tears.  In  order  to  further  characterize  response  patterns  in these  regions,  we  conducted  the  following  ROI  analysis.  3.2.2.  ROI  analysis  In  the  whole-brain  analysis,  only  the  main  effect  of  tears  showed activation  in  all  nodes  of  the  core  mentalizing  network  (the  mPFC, PCC,  and  TPJ).  Thus,  we  functionally  deﬁned  ROIs  based  on  this effect.  In  order  to  avoid  the  double-dipping  problem  (Kriegeskorte et  al.,  2009),  we  conducted  a  separate  fMRI  experiment  to  localize  the  mPFC,  PCC,  and  TPJ.  We   found  six  clusters  of  signiﬁcant activation  (Supplementary  Fig.  1  and  Table  1).  Among  these,  the  following  ﬁve  clusters  corresponded  to  the  core  mentalizing  network:  one  cluster  in  the  superior  mPFC  (dmPFC  and  vmPFC);  one cluster  in  the  inferior  mPFC  (mOFC  and  vmPFC);  one  cluster  in  the PCC;  one  cluster  in  the  left  TPJ;  and  one  cluster  in  the  right  TPJ.  We used  these  ﬁve  ROIs  in  the  analyses  (Fig.  6A).  Fig.  6B  shows  the  contrast  estimates  (i.e.,  the  activity  relative to  the  Neutral  NoTears  [N]  condition)  for  the  four  conditions  of interest.  We   conﬁrmed  that  the  contrast  estimates  in  the  ST,  SC, and  NT  conditions  were  signiﬁcantly  greater  than  the  N  condition  in  all  ROIs  except  for  the  SC  condition  in  the  superior  mPFC (p  values  <  0.05,  one-tailed  one-sample  t  tests).  More  speciﬁcally, the  same  statistical  test  showed  a  tendency  toward  signiﬁcance  in the  SC  condition  of  the  superior  mPFC  (t(37)  =  1.6,  p  =  0.06).  The  PCC  and  two   clusters  in  the  mPFC  showed  greater  activity  in the  ST  condition  compared  to  the  other  three  conditions.  Two-way × ANOVAs  (2  levels  of  Tears    2  levels  of  Expressions)  on  the  contrast estimates  of  these  regions  showed  signiﬁcant  main  effects  of  Tears [F(1,  37)  =  8.9,  p  <  0.01  for  the  PCC;  F(1,  37)  =  8.7,  p  <  0.01  for  the inferior  mPFC;  and  F(1,  37)  =  10.3,  p  <  0.01  for  the  superior  mPFC] and  Expressions  [F(1,  37)  =  13.9,  p  <  0.01  for  the  PCC;  F(1,  37)  =  23.9, p  <  0.001  for  the  inferior  mPFC;  and  F(1,  37)  =  8.6,  p  <  0.01  for the  superior  mPFC].

Post  hoc  pairwise  comparisons  (with  a  Bonferroni  correction)  in  these  regions  showed  signiﬁcantly  greater contrast  estimates  in  the  ST  than  the  SC  condition  (p  values  <  0.01), whereas  there  were  no  such  differences  between  the  NT  and  NC conditions  (p  values  >  0.2).  In  contrast  to  the  midline  regions,  we  observed  no  such  differ× ences  in  the  TPJ.  The  same  two-way  ANOVAs  (2  levels  of  Tears  2  levels  of  Expressions)  revealed  neither  signiﬁcant  main  effects (p  values  >  0.06)  nor  interactions  (p  values  >  0.3).  We   conducted a  supplementary  analysis  to  examine  further  whether  the  spatial patterns  of  activation  in  the  TPJ  were  identical  between  tears  and circles  (see  Supplementary  Materials  and  Methods).  We   found that  spatial  patterns  were  more  similar  within  the  tear  condition than  between  the  tear  and  circle  conditions,  suggesting  that activation  patterns  in  the  TPJ  are  not  identical  between  the  two (Supplementary  Fig.  2).  4.  Discussion  In  the  present  study,  the  mPFC  and  PCC  showed  a  supra-additive effect  between  sad  facial  expressions  and  the  presence  of  tears, whereas  the  TPJ  showed  no  such  effect.  4.1.  Behavioral  performance  We  conﬁrmed  the  tears  effect  (Provine  et  al.,  2009)  by  showing that  the  observation  of  tears  increased  ratings  of  sadness  compared with  control  conditions  in  which  there  were  no  tears  (no  tears and  circles  conditions;  Fig.  2).  We   also  found  interaction  effects between  sad  facial  expressions  and  tears:  the  tears  effect  was smaller  for  sad  expressions  than  for  neutral  expressions.  In  other words,  a  signal  of  sadness  shows  a  reduced  effect  when  another indicator  of  sadness  is  already  present.  This  sub-additive  effect might  be  explained  by  Weber’s  law,  which  states  that  the  change  in stimulus  intensity  that  can  be  discriminated  is  a  constant  fraction of  the  intensity  of  the  original  stimulus  (e.g.,  facial  expressions,  Gao et  al.,  2013).  4.2.  Tears  effect  in  the  mPFC,  PCC,  and  TPJ  We  found  that  all  nodes  of  the  core  mentalizing  network  (mPFC, PCC,  and  TPJ)  were  activated  when  rating  the  sadness  of  faces  with tears  compared  to  faces  without  tears  (Figs.  3  and  6B).  To  the  best of  our  knowledge,  only  one  study  has  examined  the  brain  activity of  the  tears  effect.  More  speciﬁcally,  Hendriks  et  al.  (2007)  examined  an  early  event-related  potential  (ERP)  component  (N170)  in response  to  faces  when  the  subject  observed  crying  (with  tears)  40   H.K.

These  regions  were  deﬁned  by  comparing  Tears  minus  NoTears  [(ST  +  SC)    (NT  +  N)]  in  a  separate experiment  (see  Supplementary  Fig.  1  and  Table  1  for  more  information).  (B)  ROI  analysis.  We   averaged  the  contrast  estimates  of  all  voxels  in  each  ROI  and  examined ± their   patterns  across  the  four  conditions  of  interest  (ST,  SC,  NT,  and  NC).  Data  are  presented  as  the  mean    SEM.  Asterisks  above  each  bar  indicate  the  results  of  one-tailed one-sample  t  tests  on  the  contrast  estimate  (relative  to  the  N  condition).  Asterisks  between  bars  indicate  the  statistical  signiﬁcance  of  the  post  hoc  pairwise  comparisons (with   the  Bonferroni  correction).  Two-way  ANOVAs  on  these  contrast  estimates  showed  signiﬁcant  interactions  (the  supra-additive  effect)  in  the  PCC  and  inferior  mPFC (p   values  <  0.05).  The  interaction  term  in  the  superior  mPFC  showed  a  trend  toward  signiﬁcance  (p  =  0.06).  and  other  facial  expressions.  However,  neither  the  latency  nor  the amplitude  of  the  ERPs  differed  between  crying  and  other  facial expressions.  The  present  study  has  identiﬁed  the  neural  substrates underlying  the  tears  effect.  4.3.  Supra-additive  effects  between  tears  and  facial  expressions  in the  mPFC  and  PCC  We   found  that  the  inferior  mPFC  (covering  the  mOFC  and vmPFC)  and  the  PCC  showed  not  only  main  effects  of  facial  expression  and  tears,  but  also  supra-additive  effects  between  them.  As  in  the  ﬁeld  of  multisensory  research,  our  result  indicates that  the  mPFC  and  PCC  are  involved  in  integrating  tears  and  facial expressions  for  the  purpose  of  inferring  others’  sadness.  In  other words,  these  regions  might  be  engaged  in  combining  the  perceived social  signals  to  infer  the  most  likely  extent  of  others’  sadness.  Previous  lesion  studies  showed  that  damage  to  the  orbitofrontal cortex  (OFC),  a  part  of  the  mPFC,  produces  impairments  in  the recognition  of  social  signals  involving  emotional  facial  expressions  (Hornak  et  al.,  1996;  Blair  and  Cipolotti,  2000;  Rolls,  2004; Dal  Monte  et  al.,  2013;  Willis  et  al.,  2014)  and  emotional  vocal expressions  (Hornak  et  al.,  1996,  2003;  Rolls,  2004).  In  accord with  these  ﬁndings,  previous  neuroimaging  studies  have  indicated that  the  mPFC  contains  abstract  representations  of  others’  emotional  states  regardless  of  the  type  of  social  signal  (Peelen  et  al., 2010;  Skerry  and  Saxe,  2014).  However,  as  each  type  of  social signal  was  presented  separately  in  these  studies,  it  was  unclear whether  the  mPFC  showed  an  interaction  effect  between  multiple social  signals.  Moreover,  unlike  the  mPFC,  the  role  of  the  PCC  has been  poorly  investigated  in  the  context  of  mentalizing.  The  current  study  revealed  that  the  mPFC  and  PCC  showed  an  interaction effect  between  distinct  social  signals  during  affective  mentalizing,  H.K.  Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43   41  providing  more  direct  evidence  for  the  integration  of  social  signals in  these  regions.  One  explanation  of  our  result  is  that  the  integration  process  is conducted  in  other  brain  regions,  and  the  supra-additive  effect  in the  mPFC  and  PCC  represents  the  extent  of  others’  sadness  provided  by  such  an  integration  process.  However,  this  interpretation was  not  supported  by  two  ﬁndings:  ﬁrst,  only  the  mPFC  and  PCC consistently  met   the  criteria  of  convergence  (i.e.,  were  activated  by each  social  signal)  and  interaction;  and  second,  the  sadness  rating showed  the  sub-additive  effect,  but  not  the  supra-additive  effect (Fig.  2).  Thus,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  supra-additive  effect  in  these regions  simply  represents  the  extent  of  sadness.  Rather,  it  is  better explained  by  the  hypothesis  that  integrating  two  different  social signals  (for  the  purpose  of  affective  mentalizing)  imposes  greater processing  demands  in  the  mPFC  and  PCC  than  individual  signals. The  core  mentalizing  network  (such  as  the  mPFC  and  PCC)  and the  human  homologue  of  the  mirror-neuron  system  (e.g.,  the  inferior  frontal  gyrus  and  inferior  parietal  lobule)  are  both  active  during the  recognition  of  others’  facial  emotions  (Phan  et  al.,  2002;  Carr et  al.,  2003;  Winston  et  al.,  2003;  Lennox  et  al.,  2004;  Vytal  and Hamann,  2010;  Kitada  et  al.,  2013).  As  compared  to  the  mirrorneuron  system,  the  core  mentalizing  network  seems  to  be  active when  observers  reﬂect  on  the  cause  of  the  behavior  —  e.g.,  why  is this  person  shedding  tears?  (Van  Overwalle  and  Baetens,  2009).  The core  mentalizing  network  is  also  proposed  to  be  a  part  of  the  social “reﬂective  system”  (C  system),  a  slow  system  that  is  responsible  for taking  situational  constraint  information  and  other  prior  knowledge  into  account  for  mentalizing  (Satpute  and  Lieberman,  2006). In  order  to  determine  that  the  person  shedding  tears  is  sad,  we  rely on  knowledge  based  on  previous  experience.  Consistent  with  this view,  the  PCC  is  associated  with  long-term  memory  (Minoshima et  al.,  1997;  Ranganath  et  al.,  2004;  Wagner  et  al.,  2005;  Cavanna and  Trimble,  2006;  Matsuda,  2007).  For  instance,  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD)  is  characterized  not  only  by  medial  temporal  lobe  (MTL) atrophy,  but  also  by  a  reduction  of  glucose  metabolism  in  the cingulo-parietal  cortex,  including  the  precuneus  (Matsuda,  2007). Activity  in  the  precuneus  is  reduced  in  patients  with  very-earlystage  AD  who  exhibit  only  memory  impairment,  without  general cognitive  decline  (Minoshima  et  al.,  1997).  The  default  mode  network  (DMN),  including  the  PCC  and  mPFC,  is  often  associated  with mind  wandering,  which  can  result  in  the  retrieval  of  an  episodic memory  (Mason  et  al.,  2007;  Spreng  et  al.,  2009).  In  the  present study,  the  PCC  showed  activation  not  only  in  the  presence  of  tears, but  also  during  the  observation  of  sad  facial  expressions  (relative to  neutral  expressions;  Figs.  4  and  6B).  Therefore,  the  PCC  might be  involved  in  the  retrieval  of  the  social  meaning  of  tears  (i.e.,  as  a symbol  of  sadness)  from  long-term  memory,  and  the  integration  of the  retrieved  social  knowledge  with  the  sad  facial  expression.  In  addition  to  the  PCC,  we  found  the  supra-additive  effect  in the  inferior  mPFC,  including  the  mOFC  and  vmPFC.  Subregions  in the  mPFC  are  thought  to  play  distinct  but  complementary  roles  in mentalizing  (Amodio  and  Frith,  2006;  Krueger  et  al.,  2009).  Krueger et  al.  (2009)  proposed  that  the  inferior  mPFC  supports  inferences about  the  likely  affective  response  and  reward  value  accompanying  goal  achievement.  According  to  this  hypothesis,  the  process  of integrating  tears  and  facial  expressions  in  this  region  might  reﬂect the  evaluation  of  the  state  of  sadness  (i.e.,  how  sad  is  this  person?).  Lesions  in  the  OFC  can  lead  to  abnormal  social  judgments  in response  to  emotional  faces  (Willis  et  al.,  2010).  More  speciﬁcally, the  subjects  in  this  study  were  presented  with  faces  portraying emotional  expressions  and  asked  to  imagine  whether  they  would approach  them  to  ask  for  directions.  Compared  to  control  (intact) subjects  and  patients  with  damage  to  frontal  regions  sparing  the OFC,  the  patients  with  damage  to  the  OFC  tended  to  have  abnormal   approachability  judgments:  OFC  patients  rated  faces  displaying negative  emotional  expressions  as  signiﬁcantly  more  approachable  than  the  other  subject  groups.  We   also  found  that  the  superior  mPFC showed  a  tendency  toward  the  supra-additive  effect  (Fig.  6B).  The superior  mPFC  is  thought  to  support  inferences  about  the  likely actions  performed  by  others  for  goal  achievement  (i.e.,  why  is  this person  shedding  tears?)  (Krueger  et  al.,  2009).  As  such,  it  is  possible that,  along  with  the  PCC,  these  subregions  in  the  mPFC  might  work in  concert  to  infer  another’s  state  of  sadness  at  an  abstract  level.  We  also  observed  the  supra-additive  effect  in  areas  of  the  limbic system  such  as  the  MTL   and  amygdala  (Table  4).  The  supra-additive effect  in  the  MTL   is  consistent  with  our  speculation  that  the  social knowledge  of  tears  is  retrieved  from  long-term  memory  and  integrated  with  sad  facial  expressions  (Eldridge  et  al.,  2000;  Miyashita, 2004).  The  amygdala  is  considered  as  a  part  of  the  social  “reﬂexive  system”  (X  system),  which  automatically  and  quickly  evaluates others’  behavior  (Satpute  and  Lieberman,  2006).  Thus,  this  reﬂexive  system  (X  system)  might  be  engaged  in  the  integration  of  social signals  directly  (Morris  et  al.,  1998)  or  indirectly  via  the  top-down modulation  from  parts  of  the  reﬂective  system  (C  system),  such as  the  mPFC  and  PCC  (Ochsner  et  al.,  2002;  Pessoa  et  al.,  2002). However,  unlike  the  mPFC  and  PCC,  the  MTL   and  amygdala  were not  consistently  activated  by  the  presence  of  tears  in  the  two experiments;  they  were  not  activated  in  the  separate  experiment (Supplementary  Fig.  1  and  Table  1).  Therefore,  further  studies  are necessary  to  examine  whether  the  MTL   and  amygdala  are  important  for  the  integration  of  tears  and  facial  expressions.  4.4.  No  interaction  effect  in  the  TPJ  Like  the  mPFC  and  PCC,  the  TPJ  showed  greater  activation  when viewing  faces  with  tears  than  without  tears,  which  was  a  more  liberal  control  than  circles  (Figs.  3  and  6A).  However,  we  observed no  interaction  between  facial  expressions  and  tears  (Fig.  6B).  These results  indicate  that  the  TPJ  is  engaged  not  in  the  integration  of signals  related  to  tears  and  facial  expressions,  but  rather  in  the processing  of  tears.  The  TPJ  is  thought  to  be  a  hub  of  diverse  functions,  including perceptual/motor  reorienting  and  theory  of  mind  (Cabeza  et  al., 2012).  It  has  been  proposed  that  one  of  the  general  functions  of  the TPJ  is  to  detect  a  mismatch  between  our  expectations  and  actual outcomes  (Corbetta  et  al.,  2008;  Koster-Hale  and  Saxe,  2013).  More speciﬁcally,  the  TPJ  is  activated  when  a  target  is  presented  in  an unexpected  location  in  spatial  attention  tasks  (Posner  paradigm; Corbetta  and  Shulman,  2002).  False-belief  stories,  which  are  often used  in  mentalizing  tasks,  require  processing  information  detected outside  the  main  focus  of  attention  (Cabeza  et  al.,  2012).  Shedding tears  (in  adults)  and  circles  are  rarely  observed  in  our  daily  life, whereas  the  activation  pattern  between  tears  and  circles  differed  in the  TPJ.  Therefore,  it  is  possible  that  the  TPJ  is  involved  in  detecting and  perceiving  unusual  objects  such  as  tears.  4.5.  Limitations  −   SC)   −   (NT   Two   limitations  must  be  considered.  First,  we  utilized  pictures of  different  individuals  between  the  sad  and  neutral  conditions.  It is  unlikely  that  the  supra-additive  effect  is  also  affected  by  the  difference  in  facial  identity,  because  this  factor  is  subtracted  out  in  the − supra-additive  effect  [(ST    NC)].  However,  we   cannot rule  out  the  possibility  that  greater  activity  in  sad  expressions  (relative  to  neutral  expressions)  can  be  partially  explained  by  different facial  identity.  Second,  we   used  only  female  subjects,  because  they tend  to  react  to  crying  people  with  more  sympathy  and  support than  males  (Cretser  et  al.,  1982).  However,  future  studies  should test  whether  this  ﬁnding  can  be  generalized  to  male  subjects,  and examine  the  integration  of  facial  expressions  and  tears  in  genders that  are  different  from  the  subjects  (the  cross-gender  effect).  42   5.  Conclusions  H.K.  Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43  The  present  study  investigated  which  nodes  of  the  core  mentalizing  network  are  involved  in  the  integration  of  tears  and  facial expressions  that  are  used  to  infer  the  extent  of  another’s  sadness. We   found  that  the  mPFC  and  PCC  showed  a  supra-additive  effect between  tears  and  facial  expressions.  In  contrast,  the  TPJ  showed no  such  effect.  These  results  indicate  that  the  mPFC  and  PCC  are involved  in  integrating  distinct  social  signals  to  represent  others’ sadness  at  an  abstract  level.  These  results  highlight  the  differences in  the  contributions  of  the  mPFC,  PCC,  and  TPJ  to  affective  mentalizing.

Here, we explored whether inter-individual variation in levels of trait negative urgency was associated with inter-individual variation in regional grey matter volumes. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in a sample (n = 152) of healthy participants, we found that smaller volumes of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and right temporal pole, regions previously linked to emotion appraisal, emotion regulation and emotion-based decision-making, were associated with higher levels of trait negative urgency. When controlling for other impulsivity linked personality traits (sensation seeking, lack of planning/perseverance) and negative emotionality per se (neuroticism), these associations remained, and an additional relationship was found between higher levels of trait negative urgency and smaller volumes of the left ventral striatum. This latter ﬁnding mirrors recent VBM ﬁndings in an animal model of impulsivity. Our ﬁndings offer novel insight into the brain structure correlates of one key source of inter-individual differences in impulsivity.  © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Introduction  The personality trait of “impulsivity” has long been implicated as an important risk and maintaining factor across a diverse range of risky behaviours and mental health problems (DeYoung et al., 2010; Dalley et al., 2011). It is increasingly apparent, however, that there is no single impulsivity trait. Rather, there are separate personality traits underlying various forms of impulsive behaviour (Birkley and Smith, 2011; Sharma et al., 2013). According to one inﬂuential model, the UPPS model (Whiteside and Lynam, 2001), the construct of impulsivity encompasses four largely distinct “impulsigenic” (Sharma et al., 2013) traits or dispositions: sensation seeking (the tendency to seek excitement), lack of planning (the tendency not to plan or think ahead), lack of perseverance (the inability to sustain attention and motivation on boring tasks) and urgency (the tendency to act rashly when distressed). Subsequent revisions to this model (Birkley and Smith, 2011; Cyders and Smith, 2008; Sharma et al., 2013) have revealed that urgency has two facets (negative and positive urgency, referring to the tendency to act rashly when experiencing intensively negative or positive mood states, respectively) and that lack of planning and lack of perseverance represent two facets of a lack of conscientiousness.  A notable feature of the UPPS model is that it has drawn attention to emotion-related impulsigenic traits that were largely neglected previously. In particular, one facet of impulsivity, negative urgency, refers speciﬁcally to the disposition to act rashly in the context of intense  ⁎ Corresponding author. Fax: +44 29 208 74858.

After controlling for the other impulsivity-related traits (sensation-seeking, lack of planning/ perseverance) and for the tendency to experience negative emotions per se, negative urgency has been shown, across multiple populations, including adolescent, undergraduate, adult community and clinical samples, to be a uniquely important cross-sectional and prospective predictor of problematic involvement in several maladaptive and risky behaviours, including susceptibility to negative peer inﬂuence, risky sexual behaviour, reckless driving, intimate partner violence, smoking, alcohol problems and illegal drug use (Cyders and Coskunpinar, 2010; Dir et al., 2013; Settles et al., 2012; Stautz and Cooper, 2014). Additionally, negative urgency is the impulsigenic trait most strongly linked to the severity of psychopathology in clinical psychiatric disorders such as binge eating disorder (Racine et al., 2013), pathological gambling (Michalczuk et al., 2011) and borderline personality disorder (Whiteside et al., 2005). In particular, negative urgency is an important personality contributor across the spectrum of so-called externalizing or disinhibitory disorders (e.g. alcohol dependence, drug use, aggression and conduct disorders) (Settles et al., 2012), and may represent the personality “core” of the externalizing disorders (Clark, 2005). A critical issue for impulsivity neuroscience, then, is to determine the neurobiological underpinnings of the negative urgency trait.  Recent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have found that inter-individual variation in a number of behavioural traits – including personality traits – can be predicted from the local structure of grey matter as assessed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) (Kanai and Rees, 2011). Here, we used VBM to examine the relationship  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.061 1053-8119/© 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Lawrence / NeuroImage 115 (2015) 138–146  139  between trait negative urgency and local grey matter volumes in a sample of healthy individuals. Negative urgency can be considered to represent a personality process by which subjective distress leads to disagreeable, ill-considered rash action, and shares variance with the ‘big ﬁve’ personality traits of high neuroticism, low conscientiousness and low agreeableness (Cyders and Smith, 2008; Settles et al., 2012). DeYoung et al. (2010), using brain structure morphometry, found that lower local volumes of medial/superior frontal gyrus (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) were linked to high neuroticism, but also to low agreeableness and to low conscientiousness. Relatedly, negative urgency is thought to reﬂect, in part, underlying problems with emotion regulation (Carver et al., 2008; Cyders and Smith, 2008) and activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is associated with both instructed and spontaneous emotion regulation (Ochsner et al., 2004; Silvers et al., 2014a). Indeed, the dmPFC has been shown in a recent fMRI meta-analysis to be the region most consistently active across 48 studies of emotion regulation (Buhle et al., 2013). Hence, we predicted that, across individuals, higher levels of trait negative urgency would be associated with smaller local grey matter volume in the dmPFC. In addition, individuals with co-occurring cocaine dependence and personality disorder, characterised by very high levels of trait negative urgency, have recently been shown to have smaller grey matter volume of the right temporal pole (Albein-Urios et al., 2013). We therefore also examined potential associations between higher levels of negative urgency and smaller grey matter volumes in right temporal polar regions. To examine the unique variance explained by negative urgency, we additionally controlled for individual differences in the other impulsivityrelated traits of the UPPS model (sensation seeking, lack of planning/ perseverance) and negative emotionality per se (i.e. trait neuroticism). Our ﬁndings provide novel insight into the neurobiological variations that reﬂect inter-individual differences in tendencies towards rash, impulsive behaviours in the context of heightened negative emotions.  Methods  Sample  One-hundred and ﬁfty-two healthy right-handed participants, primarily undergraduate and graduate university students (109 females; mean age: 23.6 years [standard deviation: 5.4 years]), underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after providing written informed consent and screening for MRI contra-indications, including a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. The study was approved by the Cardiff University School of Psychology Research Ethics Committee.  Negative urgency  Trait negative urgency was measured using the UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (Whiteside and Lynam, 2001), a 45-item scale formed from a factor analysis of a wide-range of self-report impulsivity scales, and designed to assess urgency, lack of planning, lack of perseverance and sensation seeking. The 12-item negative urgency subscale contains questions such as “I am always able to keep my feelings under control” and uses a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (agree strongly) to 4 (disagree strongly). Higher mean scores reﬂect higher levels of impulsivity. It has excellent internal consistency, with Cronbach's alpha level typically exceeding 0.8 (in this study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.79). An extensive body of evidence supports the validity of the negative urgency scale. The scale has repeatedly emerged as uni-dimensional, scores converge across self-report and interview assessment methods (Smith et al., 2007), and the scale is gender invariant (i.e. measures the same trait in women and men) (Cyders, 2013). Further, trait negative urgency has excellent discriminant validity in comparison to measures of the other UPPS traits, and correlates with criterion variables as predicted  by theory (for a review, see Birkley and Smith, 2011; Cyders and Smith, 2008).  Here, mean scores (out of a maximum possible score of four) for negative urgency were calculated and used in all analyses. The other traits from the UPPS (lack of planning, lack of perseveration and sensation-seeking) were also scored and used as covariates.  Negative emotionality (neuroticism)  Trait neuroticism (the tendency to experience negative emotions) was measured using the neuroticism scale of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) 44-item version (John et al., 2008). This self-report personality scale was completed by a subset of 139 of the 152 participants described above (109 female, mean age: 23.2 years, standard deviation: 5.3). The neuroticism scale was not acquired in 13 subjects for logistical reasons. The BFI-44 neuroticism scale features eight short-phrase items, such as “I see myself as someone who is depressed, blue”, rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly). In this study, Cronbach's alpha for Neuroticism was 0.85, indicating excellent internal consistency.  MRI data-acquisition and pre-processing  MRI scans were obtained on a 3 T GE HDx signa MRI scanner at the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC) ﬁtted with an 8-channel head coil. High resolution T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient (FSPGR) coronal scans (TR = 7.9 ms, TE = 3 ms, inversion time = 450 ms, ﬂip angle = 200, 1 mm isotropic resolution) were acquired with 168 or 172 slices depending on head size.  Images were segmented using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London) into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal ﬂuid tissue classes using uniﬁed segmentation. Grey matter images were then normalised to a grey matter population template, generated from the complete image set using the diffeomorphic anatomical registration using exponentiated lie-algebra (DARTEL) registration method (Ashburner, 2007). This nonlinear warping technique minimises between-subject structural variations. All images were checked following segmentation and normalisation to ensure the accuracy of these steps. The ﬁnal voxel resolution was 1 × 1 × 1 mm3. Spatially normalised images were modulated by the Jacobian determinants so that intensities represent the amount of deformation needed to normalise the images, and then smoothed with an 8-mm full-width at halfmaximum Gaussian kernel.  Voxel based morphometry: statistical analysis  Voxel-based multiple regression analysis (based on the general linear model: GLM) was carried out using SPM8 with voxel-wise grey matter volume (GMV) as the dependent variable. Age and gender (known predictors of brain volume) were added as nuisance covariates to the GLM (Barnes et al., 2010). Negative urgency mean score was used as the predictor. Total intracranial volumes were calculated by summing the values of the native space tissue segmentations (grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal ﬂuid) using the ‘get_totals’ function in SPM8 and added as a global measure for proportional global scaling (Peelle et al., 2012). Resulting SPM tmaps were superimposed on the MNI single subject brain and labelling was carried out using the AAL atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) included in the MRIcron software package (http://www. mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/). Results were visualized using NeuroElf (www.neuroelf.net).  Statistical analysis was then carried out in the following stages.  1. Correlations between negative urgency scores and grey matter volumes were assessed using a region of interest (ROI) based approach, with ROIs sampled using 10 mm diameter spheres (drawn using the  140  N. Muhlert, A.D. Lawrence / NeuroImage 115 (2015) 138–146  WFU_PickAtlas, Maldjian et al. (2003)) centred on previously identiﬁed peak voxels in the following regions (see introduction): a. Associations with grey matter volume in the dmPFC (MNI coordinates: 3, 38, 39), based on the VBM study of personality by DeYoung et al. (2010).  b. Associations with grey matter volume in the right temporal pole (48, 11, −30), based on lower levels of volumes in this region reported in individuals with co-occurring cocaine dependence and personality disorder (Albein-Urios et al., 2013).  In each ROI, associations were corrected for multiple comparisons using Family Wise Error (FWE) correction based on Gaussian Random Field Theory (RFT) (p b .05, small volume corrected for a priori ROI). We then looked for any other regions throughout the brain that showed associations with negative urgency (p b .001, corrected for multiple comparisons based on cluster extent, accounting for nonisotropic smoothness [456 voxels]). To test for potential sex differences in the association between regional grey matter volume and negative urgency, we additionally formally tested for an interaction between gender and negative urgency scores in SPM using a full factorial model (which accounts for unequal variance) with the factor of gender, the covariates of negative urgency and age and the global factor of intracranial volume for proportional global scaling.  2. To assess the amount of unique variance captured by negative urgency, we repeated the regression after including mean [lack of perseveration and lack of planning] and sensation-seeking (as well as age and gender) as nuisance covariates. An averaged score combining (lack of) perseveration and (lack of) planning was used due to the high correlation between these two measures (r = .51, p b .001), consistent with previous ﬁndings that (lack of) perseveration and (lack of) planning are correlated facets of (low) conscientiousness (Birkley and Smith, 2011).  3. We then repeated the ROI analyses from (1) in the subset of participants (n = 139, see above) who had completed both the UPPS and the BFI-44 neuroticism scales, after including mean neuroticism score from the BFI-44 as a covariate of no interest. This analysis allowed us to examine the relation between regional grey matter volume and levels of emotion-driven rash impulsivity, controlling for inter-individual differences in the tendency to experience negative emotions per se.  Results  Mean scores on the UPPS traits, including negative urgency, together with mean levels of trait neuroticism are reported in Table 1. There was a broad range in reported trait negative urgency, with individual mean scores ranging from 1.08 to 3.58, spanning almost the entire range of possible scores (1–4). Mean levels of trait negative urgency (2.1) in our sample were comparable to those reported in a large (n N 1300) sample of undergraduate students from the USA (Cyders, 2013) (mean score = 2.3). Here, there was a non-signiﬁcant trend for women to report higher levels of negative urgency than men (t = 1.9, p = 0.06, Cohen's d = 0.3). Larger samples (e.g. Cyders, 2013) report no sex differences in mean levels of negative urgency.  ROI-based analysis  As predicted, negative associations between urgency scores and grey matter volumes were found in regions of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) (MNI coordinates x, y, z = −4, 33, 48, t = 3.67, cluster extent = 194 mm3) and in the right temporal pole (x, y, z = 26, 18, −38, t = 4.32, cluster extent = 1956 mm3), such that higher levels of negative urgency were associated with lower GM volumes in these regions (FWE corrected for multiple comparisons using Gaussian random ﬁeld theory, small volume corrected) (Fig. 1). There was no evidence for  Table 1 Mean (standard deviation) scores for UPPS impulsivity trait scales and for neuroticism (BFI-44) scores for the whole sample and for females and males separately. Values for each scale are given as mean scores for contributing items. Values in square brackets are those from the participants who completed both the UPPS and the BFI-neuroticism scale. As the number of females remained the same, this information is not repeated. The UPPS measures were scored from a possible 1–4, whereas the neuroticism measure was scored from a possible 1–5. Higher scores reﬂect higher levels of impulsivity or neuroticism, respectively.

No positive associations were observed between negative urgency  and grey matter volumes in either of the ROIs.  Both the relationship between negative urgency and dmPFC volume and the relationship between negative urgency and right anterior temporal pole volume remained signiﬁcant after controlling for the other UPPS traits. The same associations with negative urgency were seen within the dmPFC when controlling for levels of neuroticism in the subset of individuals who had completed the BFI-44 in addition to the UPPS (FWE, small volume corrected) (MNI coordinates x, y, z = −4, 34, 46; t = 3.71, cluster extent = 246 mm3).  Whole brain analyses  The whole brain analysis revealed a signiﬁcant negative association between urgency and grey matter volumes in the right temporal pole (x, y, z = 26, 20, −39, t = 4.4, cluster extent = 1874 mm3), after controlling for age and gender (Fig. 3). This was also demonstrated in the reduced subset of 139 participants (x, y, z = 26, 18, −39, t = 4.32, cluster extent = 1956 mm3). The relationship between negative urgency and grey matter volume in the right temporal pole remained signiﬁcant after additionally controlling for the other UPPS traits (x, y, z = 26, 18, −38, t = 4.15, cluster extent = 1839 mm3).  We then examined the relationship between negative urgency and grey matter volume after also controlling for levels of neuroticism in the reduced cohort of 139 participants. This revealed an additional region demonstrating a negative associations between urgency and grey matter volumes in the left ventral striatum (including nucleus accumbens) (x, y, z = −6, 10, −2, t = 4.03, cluster extent = 1393 mm3) (Fig. 4).  Discussion  In this study we provide new evidence on the unique brain structure correlates of inter-individual variation in dispositions towards rash, negative emotion-linked impulsivity (negative urgency) in a sample of healthy volunteers. In line with our a priori predictions, we found significant negative associations between trait urgency and grey matter volume in regions of the dmPFC, and in the right anterior temporal pole, such that individuals reporting higher levels of negative urgency (controlling for other UPPS impulsivity traits, age, and gender) showed smaller grey matter volumes in these brain regions. While some previous studies have linked variation in dmPFC volumes or cortical thickness to broad personality measures of impulsivity (Schilling et al., 2012), ours is the ﬁrst to speciﬁcally link variation in dmPFC volume to variation in one speciﬁc form of impulsivity, negative urgency, while controlling for levels of other impulsigenic traits.  N. Muhlert, A.D. Lawrence / NeuroImage 115 (2015) 138–146  141  Fig. 1. Regions showing negative associations between grey matter volume and urgency, after controlling for age and gender (n = 152) The left-most images show the regions of interest (10 mm diameter spheres set a priori based on previous studies, as detailed in the methods) with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex sphere at the bottom, and right anterior temporal pole sphere at the top. The images on the right (indicated by arrows) show the grey matter regions negatively associated with urgency scores within these ROIs (p b 0.05 FWE small volume corrected).  These brain–behaviour associations were also observed after accounting for levels of negative emotionality per se (trait neuroticism), indicating the unique association with negative urgency. Further, when controlling for negative emotionality, higher levels of negative urgency were associated with relatively less regional grey matter in the left ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, a ﬁnding that mirrors a recent VBM study of the brain–structure correlates of interindividual variation in impulsivity in rats (Caprioli et al., 2014).  Amongst the traits delineated in the UPPS model (Whiteside and Lynam, 2001), negative urgency is a uniquely important personality contributor to psychopathology, in particular for the broad spectrum of so-called externalizing or disinhibitory disorders (including various forms of addictive and aggressive disorders) (Birkley and Smith, 2011; Settles et al., 2012). It is therefore notable that lower levels of grey matter volume in the dmPFC, linked here to higher levels of negative urgency, are also seen in a number of different clinical externalizing disorders, including cocaine dependence (Moreno-Lopez et al., 2012; Ide et al., 2014), methamphetamine dependence (Schwartz et al., 2010), alcoholism (Grodin et al., 2013), attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (Almeida et al., 2010), and conduct disorder (Fairchild et al., 2011). Lower dmPFC grey matter volumes have also been seen in individuals with suicidality (Giakoumatos et al., 2013) and in those with borderline personality disorder (Rossi et al., 2013), where rash, negative emotiondriven impulsivity is a key feature, and which appear, in part, to be linked to the externalizing spectrum of disorders (Eaton et al., 2011). Thus, structural brain imaging studies suggest a potential shared (“trans-diagnostic”) pattern of relatively low grey matter volume in the dmPFC across several different externalizing disorders that are associated with high levels of rash impulsivity. Furthermore, lower medial frontal grey matter volumes are also seen in individuals at familial high risk for externalizing disorders, including alcohol dependence (Benegal et al., 2007). This latter ﬁnding is mirrored in the present  study, in that healthy individuals show a continuous relationship between local grey matter volume in the dmPFC and levels of a personality trait (negative urgency) thought to represent the personality “core” of the externalizing spectrum of disorders (Clark, 2005). Our ﬁndings are thus consistent with the idea that negative urgency and externalizing have shared neurobiological underpinnings and we suggest that negative urgency might represent an etiologically-relevant personality ‘endophenotype’ for the externalizing disorders, helping in part to explain their systematic co-occurrence (Clark, 2005; Robbins et al., 2012). Recent research suggests that negative urgency may be of even broader signiﬁcance to understanding risk for emotional disorders — with negative urgency acting as a prospective predictor of depression, as well as to risk for externalizing disorders (Smith et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2013). It is notable then, that both unipolar and bipolar depression have also been linked to lower grey matter volume in dmPFC (Ambrosi et al., 2013; Amico et al., 2011; Bora et al., 2012; Brooks et al., 2009), as has schizophrenia (Fornito et al., 2009). Furthermore, Caspi et al. (2013), by examining patterns of co-occurrence of major forms of psychopathology (internalizing, externalizing and thought disorders) in the longitudinal Dunedin birth cohort study, found evidence for a general liability to develop any and all forms of common psychopathology (a so-called ‘p factor’). Higher scores on this factor were associated with the personality traits of (low) conscientiousness, (low) agreeableness and (high) neuroticism — a pattern strikingly similar to that of negative urgency (Settles et al., 2012). Thus, we suggest that negative urgency is relevant to the broad cooccurrence between both externalizing and internalizing disorders, and their overlapping neurobiological substrates.  In addition to a relation with relatively smaller dmPFC grey matter volume, both the ROI-based and whole brain analysis revealed an association between lower grey matter volume in the right temporal pole and increased levels of negative urgency. Lower grey matter volume  142  A  B  Fig. 2.

Lawrence / NeuroImage 115 (2015) 138–146  or thickness in the temporal pole has previously been reported in individuals with attention deﬁcit/ hyperactivity disorder (Fernandez-Jaen et al., 2014), cocaine dependence (Albein-Urios et al., 2013) and in those with borderline and antisocial personality disorders (Bertsch et al., 2013; Boen et al., 2015). In addition, right temporal polar atrophy is observed in frontotemporal lobar dementia, where it has been associated an increase in rash impulsive behaviour (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2004; Chan et al., 2009). Our ﬁndings converge with this body of work, by demonstrating associations between inter-individual variation in trait levels of negative urgency and temporal pole grey matter volumes in healthy participants in the absence of either neurotoxic drug effects or neurodegeneration.  Theories of negative urgency conceptualize the trait in terms of inter-individual differences in emotion regulation (Carver et al., 2008), emotion-related decision-making and/or control over actions in the face of intense emotion (Cyders and Smith, 2008). Notably then, the dmPFC has been implicated in various aspects of emotion regulation (Etkin et al., 2011), including the regulation of intense negative emotions (Silvers et al., 2014b) and a recent meta-analysis of fMRI studies of emotion regulation found consistent activation in a region of dmPFC strikingly overlapping with the region in which smaller volumes were linked to higher levels of affect-driven impulsivity in our study (Buhle et al., 2013). The dmPFC is also implicated in the regulation of stress-induced craving (Seo et al., 2011). Furthermore, smaller grey matter volumes in dmPFC have been linked to higher levels of other personality traits aligned with negative urgency, including rumination and neuroticism (DeYoung et al., 2010; Kuhn et al., 2012). Focal lesions of dmPFC impair emotion regulation (Falquez et al., 2014) and also increase risky decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task (Manes et al., 2002), suggesting a broad role for dmPFC in emotion regulation and emotion-related decision-making. Perhaps most strikingly, Coombes et al. (2012) using fMRI found that dmPFC was involved in preventing emotional states interfering with on-going actions. Recently, variation in trait urgency has been linked to variation in serotonergic  Fig. 3. Regions showing a negative association between trait urgency and grey matter volume in the whole brain analysis (p b 0.001, cluster extent corrected for multiple comparisons [k = 456]).  N.

The role of the dmPFC in emotion regulation and decision making appears to be part of a broader role for this region in higher-level emotional appraisal (Etkin et al., 2011). The dmPFC forms part of the so-called “default mode network” and show increased activity when individuals have to attend to and label or evaluate their own emotional states (Gusnard et al., 2001; Ochsner et al., 2004; Doerig et al., 2013) or retrieve emotional memories (Bado et al., 2014). Further, individuals with depression show reduced activation in dmPFC both when appraising their emotions (Sheline et al., 2009) and in situations (e.g. frustration) when they must regulate their emotions (Schiller et al., 2013) to inhibit rash actions. The temporal pole, where smaller regional GM volumes were also associated with increased levels of negative urgency, is anatomically connected to the dmPFC (Saleem et al., 2008) and also plays a role in emotion regulation and higher-level appraisal of one's emotions. For example, the right temporal pole is activated both during emotion regulation (Ochsner et al., 2002) and when individuals have to verbally label their emotions (Lane et al., 1997). Right temporal pole damage, resulting from ischaemic stroke, anterior temporal lobectomy or frontotemporal dementia, is linked to impaired socio-affective processing including alexithymia (the inability to identify and describe emotions) (Olson et al., 2007). This link between negative urgency, alexithymia and the temporal pole is interesting given that negative urgency is a mediator of the relationship between alexithymia and rash, impulsive behaviours (Shishido et al., 2013). Relatively smaller right temporal polar volumes in individuals with high levels of negative urgency might relate to less effective higher-level cognitive processes relevant to appraising one's emotions and regulating one's emotions (Tavares et al., 2011).  We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association between urgency and grey matter volume of other regions linked to emotion regulation, in particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Cyders and Smith, 2008). A recent study of individuals with schizophrenia found that high levels of urgency were associated with lower cortical thickness in the medial, particularly ventromedial, prefrontal cortex (Hoptman et al., 2014). It is possible, however, that the ﬁnding in schizophrenia reﬂects at least in part the effects of antipsychotic medication and/or high levels of  substance misuse, which have been shown in animal models to inﬂuence MRI measures of cortical thickness (Wheeler et al., 2013; Vernon et al., 2014). Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis (Buhle et al., 2013) failed to ﬁnd an association between emotion regulation and activity of ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which may play a broader role in emotion generation as well as emotion regulation. Hoptman et al. (2014) did, however, ﬁnd that high levels of urgency were associated with reduced resting state connectivity of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, suggesting some similarities with the current ﬁndings.  The negative association between trait urgency and grey matter volume in the left ventral striatum, after controlling for levels of neuroticism is of particular note. Smaller ventral striatal volumes have been reported in a number of clinical externalizing disorders associated with markedly high levels of negative urgency, including alcoholism (Makris et al., 2008) and nicotine addiction (Das et al., 2012). In rats, lesions to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core) increase ‘waiting’ impulsivity, as indexed by an increase in premature responding in a 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) (Christakou et al., 2004) or a reduced ability to delay gratiﬁcation (Cardinal et al., 2001). In humans, inter-individual variation in negative urgency has been related to the ability to delay gratiﬁcation (Tsukayama et al., 2012). Further, low levels of ventral striatal dopamine d2 receptor binding are associated both with higher levels of negative urgency in humans (Clark et al., 2012) and with ‘waiting’ impulsivity in rats (Dalley et al., 2007). Most strikingly, a recent VBM study found that rats classiﬁed as high on ‘waiting’ impulsivity, as indexed by high-levels of premature responding on the 5-CSRTT, have smaller grey matter volumes in left accumbens relative to low-impulsive rats (Caprioli et al., 2014). This reduced volume was associated with corresponding reductions in levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) gene expression in this region. In humans, we have previously reported that lower levels of prefrontal GABA (measured using MR-spectroscopy) are related to higher negative urgency scores (Boy et al., 2011). Our ﬁndings thus point to potential similarities between the neurobiology underpinning the trait of negative urgency in humans, and that underpinning speciﬁc forms of impulsivity (‘waiting’ impulsivity) in animal models.  There are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting our results. First, as with all cross-sectional studies, there is no indication as to whether our correlations imply causal relationships. There are genetic inﬂuences on both negative urgency  144  N. Muhlert, A.D. Lawrence / NeuroImage 115 (2015) 138–146  (Villafuerte et al., 2012) and grey matter volumes within the dmPFC (e.g. Hulshoff Pol et al., 2006). Furthermore, genetic inﬂuences partly mediate the relationship between stress reactivity (indexed by salivary cortisol levels) and dmPFC cortical thickness (Kremen et al., 2010), suggesting that genetic factors resulting in relatively reduced functioning of dmPFC and temporal polar regions could result in higher levels of negative urgency. The similarities between our ﬁndings and those seen in animal models of impulsivity (Caprioli et al., 2014) would also be consistent with this account. At the same time, given that high levels of negative urgency may exacerbate stress exposure (Liu and Kleiman, 2012), grey matter volumes may be inﬂuenced by environmental inﬂuences, including stress, that could, over time, impact on regional grey matter volumes (Ansell et al., 2012; van Harmelen et al., 2010). Further, there is evidence to suggest that grey matter volumes are plastic, with increases following the learning of new skills (e.g. Woollett and Maguire, 2011), which could include emotion regulation skills. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that smaller grey matter volumes in those with high levels of negative urgency likely reﬂect a complex interplay between genetic and experience-dependent inﬂuences (see also Carver et al., 2011) that should be addressed in future longitudinal, genetically-informed studies.  Second, the cellular basis of the factors underlying VBM ﬁndings associated with structural MRI are unknown, as is the relationship between brain structure and brain activity as measured by functional MRI (see Kanai and Rees, 2011). Additional studies relating VBM ﬁndings to underlying structural and molecular variation in animal models of impulsivity (e.g. Caprioli et al., 2014), will facilitate further understanding of the neurobiology of this key personality trait.  Finally, our sample was not evenly matched for sex, with approximately twice as many females as males. Previous research has found that relations between negative urgency and risk outcomes do not differ by sex (Cyders, 2013), but there is some evidence for sex differences in the neural correlates of emotion regulation (e.g. McRae et al., 2008). While we did not see any signiﬁcant differences between males and females in the relationship between grey matter volumes and negative urgency scores in our study, we may have been underpowered to detect relatively subtle differences. Future large scale-studies could test potential sex differences in the neural substrates of negative urgency and other impulsigenic traits.  Conclusions  This study examined the brain structure correlates of rash, negative emotion-based impulsivity, demonstrating that relatively smaller grey matter volumes in the dmPFC, temporal pole and ventral striatum are associated with higher levels of negative urgency. The regional associations we found point to the importance of understanding the contributions of variation in both subcortical structures that likely mediate the overt behavioural manifestations of impulsivity, and within cortical regions that mediate higher-level cognitive processes, such as selfreﬂective emotional appraisal, to inter-individual variation in impulsivity, the latter of which has until recently been relatively neglected, particularly in animal models of impulsivity. Illuminating the neurobiological variation underpinning inter-individual variation in negative urgency can potentially offer novel insight into factors promoting resilience to problematic risky behaviours and diverse forms of emotional disorder.

Explanations   for this  exaggerated   reactivity   emphasize   attention,   executive   function,   and   affective   processes,   but   the associations   among   these   processes   are   rarely   investigated.   To   examine   these   interactions,   we   measure fear  potentiated   startle   (FPS;   Experiment   1)   and   neural   activation   (Experiment   2)   in   an   instructed   fear paradigm   that   manipulates   attentional   focus,   demands   on   executive   functioning,   and   emotion.   In  both studies,   exaggerated   emotional   reactivity   associated   with   externalizing   was   speciﬁc   to   conditions   that focused   attention   on  threat   information   and   placed   minimal   demands   on   executive   functioning.   Results suggest   that   a  crucial   cognition–emotion   interaction   affecting   externalizing   is   the   over-prioritization and   over-allocation   of  attention   to   motivationally   signiﬁcant   information,   which   in  turn,   may  impair executive   functions   and  affective   regulation.  © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction  The  externalizing  spectrum  encompasses  a  heterogeneous  mixture  of  behaviors,  such  as  reactive  aggression,  excessive  reward seeking,  and  low  distress  tolerance,  which  are  united  by  overlapping  genetic  variance  (Krueger  et  al.,  2005).  When  particularly severe  or  persistent,  these  behaviors  may   culminate  in  diagnosable disinhibitory  psychopathology,  including  conduct  disorder,  substance  use  disorders,  and  antisocial  personality  disorder.  Although externalizing  behaviors  may   result  in  diverse  diagnoses,  the essence  of  the  externalizing  construct  is  that  these  behaviors  and disorders  reﬂect  a  common  predisposition  or  temperament  associated  with  basic  personality  traits  (e.g.,  low  constraint,  impulsivity, negative  emotionality).  Thus,  specifying  the  risk  associated  with these  predisposing  personality  traits  has  far-reaching  implications for  understanding  and  preventing  a  diverse  array  of  externalizing behaviors  and  disinhibitory  psychopathology  (Iacono  et  al.,  2008; Krueger  et  al.,  2005;  Gorenstein  and  Newman,  1980;  Newman, 1997;  Patrick  and  Zempolich,  1998;  Zuckerman,  1978).  Clinical  descriptions  of  externalizing  highlight  an  exaggerated  emotional  reactivity  that  is  presumed  to  underlie  diverse  ∗ Corresponding  author  at:  University  of  Wisconsin–Madison,  1202  W  Johnson St.,   Madison,  WI   53706,  USA.

This  reactivity  plays  out  in  the  context  of  rewards  (Buckholtz  et  al., 2010a;  Endres  et  al.,  2011;  Martin  and  Potts,  2004;  Newman  et  al., 1985,  1990;  Nichols  and  Newman,  1986;  Patterson  et  al.,  1987), stressful  events  (Taylor  et  al.,  1999;  Verona  et  al.,  2002),  and  other motivationally  signiﬁcant  cues  (i.e.,  drug  cues;  Volkow  and  Li, 2004).  Prominent  explanations  for  the  exaggerated  reactivity  associated  with  externalizing  traits,  commonly  emphasize  cognitive dysfunctions,  such  as  poor  executive  functioning  (e.g.,  Finn  et  al., 2002;  Giancola  and  Tarter,  1999).  Such  explanations  highlight  the fact  that  limitations  in  cognitive  control  or  working  memory  capacity  can  undermine  a  person’s  ability  to  regulate  (i.e.,  bias)  attention and,  thus,  increase  the  likelihood  that  motivational  stimuli  will hijack  attention  and  control  behavior  (Bishop,  2009).  In  the  absence of  such  executive  control,  reactions  to  motivationally  signiﬁcant information  are  difﬁcult  to  inhibit  (e.g.,  negative  mood,  aggressive impulse,  drug  seeking)  and  become  distracting  regardless  of  their adaptive  relevance  (Bishop,  2009;  MacCoon  et  al.,  2004).  Consistent with  these  models,  there  is  considerable  evidence  that  externalizing  traits  are  associated  with  executive  functioning  deﬁcits  (Dolan et  al.,  2008;  Endres  et  al.,  2011;  Morgan  and  Lilienfeld,  2000;  Ogilvie et  al.,  2011).  To  the  extent  that  this  understanding  of  externalizing  traits  is  correct,  it  follows  that  individuals  with  a  high  level  of externalizing  traits  (i.e.,  externalizers)  would  be  especially  prone  to  A.R.  Baskin-Sommers  et  al.  /  Biological  Psychology  91 (2012) 48–  58  49  exaggerated  emotional  reactivity  under  conditions  that  pit  salient emotional  information  against  a  goal-directed  focus  (i.e.,  a  go/nogo  mixed-incentive  learning  task;  see  Endres  et  al.,  2011;  Patterson et  al.,  1987).  An  alternative  explanation  for  the  exaggerated  emotional  reactivity  and  disinhibited  behavior  associated  with  externalizing  traits involves  the  over-allocation  of  attention  resources.  Attentionbased  models  of  externalizing  commonly  assume  that  when  these individuals  encounter  information  in  their  environment  that  is motivationally  signiﬁcant,  they  allocate  attention  to  this  information  more  strongly  and  thus,  have  more  difﬁculty  reallocating attention  (Ávila  and  Parcet,  2001;  Derryberry  and  Reed,  1994; Farmer  et  al.,  2007;  Lubman  et  al.,  2008;  Pessoa,  2005;  Wallace  and Newman,  1997).  In  this  context,  the  strength  of  the  over-allocation of  attention  is  dependent  on  the  interaction  between  the  preexisting  priorities  (i.e.,  readiness  to  perceive  speciﬁc  information) and  the  stimulus  (i.e.,  what  is  actually  seen  in  the  environment). In  other  words,  information  that  matches  pre-existing  priorities, like  rewards,  threat,  or  drugs,  is  strongly  attended  to,  particularly when  the  individual  is  seeking  or  expecting  those  cues  (see  Bishop, 2009;  Fox  et  al.,  2002;  Wallace  and  Newman,  1990  for  examples of  this  attentional  process  in  other  populations).  Consistent  with this  attention-related  proposal,  a  number  of  studies  ﬁnd  strong attention  allocation  and  difﬁculties  re-allocating  attention  in  the presence  of  motivationally  signiﬁcant,  goal-relevant  cues  among individuals  high  on  externalizing  traits  (Ávila  and  Parcet,  2001; Baskin-Sommers  et  al.,  2010;  Derryberry  and  Reed,  1994;  Tiffany and  Conklin,  2000;  Wallace  and  Newman,  1997).  Moreover,  some theoretical  accounts  of  this  attentional  response  suggest  that  the over-prioritization  and  over-allocation  of  attentional  resources, in  turn,  may   impair  executive  functions  that  normally  moderate  responding,  including  inhibition,  shifting,  and  control  (Ellis and  Ashbrook,  1988;  Farmer  et  al.,  2007;  Keil  et  al.,  2007).  Thus, externalizing  traits  would  be  most  associated  with  exaggerated emotional  reactivity  when  anticipation  of  motivationally  significant  stimuli  increases  the  intensity  of  attention  responses  to environmental  cues  and  interferes  with  the  executive  functionbased  regulation  of  this  response.  Importantly,  such  a  process appears  to  play  an  important  role  in  disrupting  the  inhibition  of drug  craving  (Tiffany  and  Conklin,  2000;  Volkow  and  Li,  2004)  and violent  responses  (Blair,  2001).  In  light  of  growing  evidence  that  executive  functioning,  attentional,  and  emotional  processes  interact  to  yield  the  exaggerated emotional  reactivity  and  disinhibited  behavior  associated  with externalizing,  it  is  increasingly  important  to  clarify  the  speciﬁc and/or  differential  contributions  of  these  factors  for  the  disinhibited  reactions  associated  with  externalizing  traits  (see  also  Endres et  al.,  2011;  Handley  et  al.,  2011).  A  simple  explanation  for  the emotional  hyper-reactivity  of  externalizing  individuals  is  that  the intensity  of  their  emotion  reactions  is  so  powerful  and  pervasive  that  it  directly  gives  rise  to  this  emotional  reaction.  However, the  executive  functioning  perspective  suggests  that  deﬁcits  in regulating  competing  demands  (i.e.,  goal  versus  processing  motivationally  signiﬁcant  information)  impacts  emotional  reactivity,  such that  when  an  individual  does  not  have  the  capacity  to  maintain their  goal-directed  focus  and  resolve  the  competition,  motivationally  signiﬁcant  information  hijacks  attention  and  externalizers are  likely  to  over-react  to  that  emotional  information.  In  contrast  to  these  other  explanations,  the  attention-based  perspective attributes  the  exaggerated  emotional  reactions  of  externalizing individuals  to  the  interaction  between  their  motivational  priorities and  the  occurrence  of  stimuli  that  match  these  priorities.  When individuals  with  high  externalizing  traits  encounter  motivationally  signiﬁcant  stimuli  that  match  their  processing  priorities,  the stimuli  attract  strong  attentional  responses,  consume  resources, and  yield  emotional  reactions  that  are  dictated  by  the  pre-existing  processing  priorities  and  the  affective  signiﬁcance  of  the  information.  Although  each  of  these  psychobiological  explanations  is plausible,  they  predict  different  sources  of  emotional  and  behavioral  disinhibition.  Thus,  it  is  important  to  examine  the  differential contributions  of  emotional  hyper-reactivity,  executive  functioning, and  attention  to  the  disinhibited  emotional  reactions  of  externalizing  individuals.  The  goal  of  the  present  studies  is  to  examine  these  alternative explanations  for  the  exaggerated  emotional  reactivity  associated with  externalizing  traits.  To  this  end,  we  employed  an  instructed fear  paradigm  developed  by  Baskin-Sommers  et  al.  (2011)  (see Fig.  1).  In  all  conditions,  trials  contain  colored  boxes  that  are  associated  with  the  delivery  of  an  electric  shock  (red  box)  or  not  (green box).  Additionally,  this  paradigm  orthogonally  manipulates  two factors:  the  focus  of  attention  and  the  timing  of  goal-relevant  stimulus  presentation.  In  two   conditions  instructions  are  given  that establish  the  threat  information  as  goal-relevant  and  thus  the  primary  focus  of  attention  [Threat  Focus  conditions].  In  two  other conditions  the  threat  information  is  peripheral  to  the  primary goal  (i.e.,  the  primary  goal  is  to  categorize  the  case  of  a  letter, yet  the  box  predicting  shock  still  appears  in  the  trial)  [Alternative  Focus  conditions].  The  paradigm  also  manipulates  the  timing with  which  goal-relevant  and  distracting  stimuli  are  presented  (i.e., from  the  start  of  the  trial  (early)  or  after  a  distractor  is  presented (late)).  Together,  these  manipulations  result  in  four  conditions (Early  Threat  Focus,  Late  Threat  Focus,  Early  Alternative  Focus, Late  Alternative  Focus).  Based  on  this  paradigm  and  the  theoretical alternatives  outlined  above  (i.e.,  general  hyper-reactivity  to  emotion,  weak  executive  functioning,  and  over-allocation  of  attention), we  investigated  three  hypotheses  that  aim  to  characterize  and  disambiguate  the  cognition–emotion  interactions  that  culminate  in the  disinhibited  emotional  reactivity  associated  with  externalizing:  Hypothesis  1.  To  the  extent  that  externalizing  traits  are  associated  with  a  global  hyper-reactivity  to  motivationally  signiﬁcant information,  individuals  high  on  these  traits  should  display  greater emotion  in  all  conditions  (i.e.,  main  effect),  regardless  of  the demands  on  executive  functioning  or  attentional  focus.  Hypothesis  2.  To  the  extent  that  externalizing  traits  are  associated  with  a  fundamental  deﬁcit  in  executive  functioning  then emotional  hyper-reactivity  would  be  apparent  especially  under conditions  that  require  participants  to  maintain  a  goal-directed focus  of  attention  despite  competing  demands  to  focus  attention on  the  highly  distracting  threat  information  (i.e.,  the  two  Alternative  Focus  conditions).  By  contrast,  in  the  Threat  Focus  conditions the  goal  is  to  focus  on  the  threat  information  while  ignoring  an  irrelevant,  and  actually  meaningless,  letter.  Because  the  letter  lacks  the bottom-up  salience  of  the  threat  information  and  does  not  compete meaningfully  with  the  primary  goal  (i.e.,  focusing  on  the  threat), the  executive  functioning  hypothesis  does  not  primarily  predict emotional  dysregulation  in  the  Threat  Focus  conditions.  Hypothesis  3.  To  the  extent  that  emotional  hyper-reactivity  in externalizing  relates  to  over-allocation  of  attention  to  motivationally  signiﬁcant  stimuli,  this  problem  would  be  most  apparent  under conditions  that  activate  a  speciﬁc  motivational  focus  (i.e.,  focusing  on  threat)  and  then  initially  display  stimuli  that  match  that motivational  focus  (goal-relevant  threat  cues;  i.e.,  Early  Threat Focus).  Paradoxically,  though,  when  information  that  does  not match  the  motivational  set  appears,  the  over-allocation  of  attention  in  anticipation  of  perceiving  motivationally  signiﬁcant  stimuli would  reduce  the  ﬂexibility  of  attention,  interfere  with  reallocation of  attention  to  actual  goal-relevant  information  (i.e.,  threat),  and thus  diminish  emotion  responses  to  threat-relevant  stimuli  (i.e., in  the  Late  Threat  Focus  condition).  By  contrast,  in  the  Alternative Focus  conditions  the  threat  information  is  peripheral  to  the  primary  50  A.R.  Baskin-Sommers  et  al.  /  Biological  Psychology  91 (2012) 48–  58  Fig.  1.  Instructed  fear  paradigm.  The  task  consisted  of  four  conditions  in  which  focus  of  attention  and  timing  of  attentional  focus  was  manipulated:  (A)  Early  Threat  Focus,  (B) Late   Threat  Focus,  (C)  Late  Alternative  Focus,  and  (D)  Early  Alternative  Focus.  During  Threat  Focus  participants  attended  to  the  color  of  a  box  predicting  shock  administration (red   =  potential  shock,  green  =  safe).  For  Alternative  Focus,  participants  were  instructed  to  attend  to  the  case  of  a  letter  stimulus.  During  Early  trials  the  stimulus  to  be  attended to   was   presented  ﬁrst  and  during  Late  trials  it  was  presented  second.  For  Study  1  80  trials  of  each  condition  and  for  Study  2  60  trials  of  each  condition  were  presented  in a   blocked  format  with  the  order  counterbalanced  across  participants.  For  Study  1  only,  white-noise  startle  probes  were  presented  at  1400  ms   to  measure  fear  potentiated startle.  (For  interpretation  of  the  references  to  color  in  this  ﬁgure  legend,  the  reader  is  referred  to  the  web   version  of  the  article.)  goal,  thus  participants  with  high  and  low  levels  of  externalizing traits  would  be  expected  to  allocate  attention  to  both  goal-relevant (i.e.,  letters)  and  intrinsically  relevant  (i.e.,  colored  boxes)  stimuli  and  display  comparable  emotional  reactivity  in  the  Alternative Focus  conditions.  To  assess  these  alternative  hypotheses,  we  conducted  two studies.  The  ﬁrst,  used  fear  potentiated  startle  (FPS),  a  psychophysiological  measure  of  fear  reactivity,  to  examine  the  effect  of speciﬁc  cognitive-affective  interactions  on  externalizing-related differences  in  emotional  reactivity.  The  second  study  used  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI)  in  a  different  sample  as  a means  of  extending  the  ﬁndings  of  Study  1  and  evaluating  the  neural  correlates  associated  with  these  cognition–emotion  interactions and  reactivity.  2.  Study  1:  fear  potentiated  startle  2.1.  Methods  2.1.1.  Participants  Participants  were  84  male  inmates  from  a  maximum-security  prison  in  southern Wisconsin.  First,  participants  who  were  older  then  45  years  of  age  were  eliminated  because  the  expression  of  externalizing  traits  (i.e.,  impulsivity)  has  been found  to  decline  with  advancing  age  (Hare  et  al.,  1990).  Also,  some  research  suggests  that  memory  and  cognitive  functioning  begins  to  decline  starting  around age  45  (Singh-Manoux  et  al.,  2012).  Second,  to  increase  the  likelihood  that  participants  had  the  intellectual  aptitude  to  complete  self-report  measures  and  laboratory tasks,  we  excluded  those  with  scores  below  70  on  the  Shipley  Institute  of  Learning (Zachary,  1986)  estimate  of  intelligence.  Third,  based  on  institutional  records,  we disqualiﬁed  individuals  with  clinical  diagnoses  of  schizophrenia,  bipolar  disorder,  or  psychosis  NOS.  Lastly,  anyone  who  was  currently  using  psychotropic  medications was  excluded  because  this  class  of  medication  may   interfere  with  startle  reactivity (see  Table  1  for  descriptive  statistics).  assessed  using   the  Multidimensional   (MPQ-B),  a  155   Externalizing  was    item  self-report  questionnaire   Personality (Patrick Questionnaire-Brief  et   al.,  2002).  The  higher-order  factors  of  Constraint  (CON)  and  Negative  Affect (NA)  of  the  MPQ-B  are  related  to  externalizing  tendencies  (Eisenberg  et  al.,  2000; Krueger  et  al.,  2000;  Miller  et  al.,  2003).  Those  high  on  negative  emotionality  have tendencies  towards  stress  reactivity,  aggression,  and  alienation.  Individuals  low  on constraint  are  characterized  by  impulsivity,  low  harm  avoidance,  and  disinhibition (CON  reverse  scored).  Here,  we  standardized  and  mean-centered  NA  and  CON scales  so  that  each  was  weighted  equally.  Then,  we   created  a  composite  of  NA  and CON  (i.e.,  high  NA  and  low  CON)  as  an  index  of  externalizing  psychopathology (Cronbach’s  alpha  =  .84).  2.1.2.  Procedure  Individuals  meeting  the  inclusion  criteria  (see  Section  2.1.1)  were  invited  to participate  in  an  ongoing  study.  All  participants  provided  written  informed  consent  according  to  the  procedures  set  forth  by  the  University  of  Wisconsin–Madison Human  Subjects  Committee.  Participants  were  tested  by  one  of  two  male  experimenters  in  a  quiet  and  private  testing  room  on  prison  grounds.  Before  beginning the   main  task,  the  intensity  of  shocks  received  during  the  experimental  session  was calibrated  to  a  participant’s  subjective  shock  sensitivity  (see  Section  2.1.3).  Then, participants  were  given  verbal  instructions  about  the  instructed  fear-conditioning task.  During  the  main  task,  participants  were  reminded  on  the  computer  of  the instructions  for  each  condition  prior  to  the  start  of  that  condition.  2.1.3.  Shock  sensitivity  evaluation  To  control  for  individual  differences  in  shock  sensitivity,  the  intensity  of shocks  received  during  the  instructed  fear  task  was  calibrated  to  the  participants’  individual  subjective  shock  sensitivity  prior  to  the  beginning  of  the  task. A   series  of  electric  shocks  was   administered  in  increasing  intensity  to  the  ﬁngers   of  their  non-dominant  hand.  Participants  reported  two  intensity  anchors: the   ﬁrst  intensity  that  they  considered  uncomfortable  and  then  the  maximum  A.R.

The  series  was  terminated  when  they  reached their  maximum  intensity  level.  The  shock  intensity  administered  during  the  experimental  session  was   calibrated  to  the  reported  maximum  intensity  level.  2.1.4.   Instructed  fear-conditioning  task  Presentation  of  stimuli  and  recording  of  responses  were  controlled  by  DMDX (Forster  and  Forster,  2003)  and  NeuroScan  Synamps2  ampliﬁers  and  acquisition software.  The  instructed  fear  task  consisted  of  four  conditions  with  80  trials  per condition.  The  task  conditions  crossed  focus  of  attention  and  timing  of  goal-relevant information,  yielding  the  Early  Threat  Focus,  Late  Threat  Focus,  Early  Alternative Focus,  and  Late  Alternative  Focus  conditions  (Fig.  1).  At  the  start  of  each  condition participants  were  given  instructions  about  which  stimulus  was   goal-relevant.  In  the two  Threat  Focus  conditions,  participants  attended  to  the  color  of  a  box  predicting shock  administration  (red  =  potential  shock,  green  =  safe,  no  chance  of  shock).  In  the two  Alternative  Focus  conditions,  participants  were  instructed  to  attend  to  the  case of   a  letter  stimulus  and  the  case  of  the  letter  was  unrelated  to  administration  of electric  shocks.  In  both  condition  types,  the  intensity  of  shocks  was   calibrated  to participants’  subjective  tolerance  (a  procedure  administered  prior  to  the  task).  Also, each  condition  was  presented  in  a  blocked  format  with  the  order  counterbalanced across  participants  (Note:  Order  of  condition  did  not  interact  signiﬁcantly  with  the effects  reported  below).  In  each  trial  the  box  (red  or  green)  and  letter  (uppercase  “N”  or  lowercase  “n”) were  presented  sequentially  with  the  order  varying  according  to  condition.  During Early  trials  the  goal-relevant  stimuli  (i.e.,  stimuli  individuals  were  to  respond  to  at the  end  of  the  trial)  were  presented  ﬁrst  and  during  Late  trials  goal-relevant  stimuli were  presented  second  after  goal-irrelevant  information  was  on  the  screen.  Every trial  in  all  conditions  started  with  a  ﬁxation  cross.  The  ﬁrst  stimulus  appeared  alone at   200  ms,   and  then  the  second  stimulus  appeared  concurrently  with  the  ﬁrst  at 400  ms.   Following  the  offset  of  the  stimuli,  a  blank  screen  appeared.  Shocks  were presented  during  the  last  200  ms   of  the  blank  screen  (at  1400  ms).  Finally,  1600  ms after   the  onset  of  the  ﬁrst  stimulus  participants  were  signaled  to  press  a  button indicating  whether  a  probe  word,  “Red”  or  “Green”  for  the  Threat  Focus  conditions and  “Upper  or  “Lower”  for  the  Alternative  Focus  conditions  matched  the  stimulus presented  during  that  trial.  Across  conditions,  ﬁfteen  percent  of  the  trials  where  shocked.  In  addition  to  the shocked  trials,  sixty-four  startle-eliciting  noise  probes  (50  ms,   102  dB  white  noise burst  with  near  instantaneous  rise  time)  were  presented  1400  ms   after  the  onset  of the   ﬁrst  stimulus.  The  noise  probes  were  equally  distributed  across  threat/no-threat trials  in  all  four  task  conditions  so  that  each  participant  received  16  noise  probes (8   threat  and  8  no-threat)  per  task  condition.  Noise  probes  were  also  equally  distributed  across  upper/lower  case  trials.  Noise  probes  were  separated  by  a  minimum of   13  s  and  never  occurred  on  the  same  trial  as  shock  administration.  2.1.5.  Startle  measurement  Startle  eyeblink  electromyographic  activity  was  sampled  and  ampliﬁed  with Neuroscan  Synamps2  ampliﬁers  (Comupmedics  Inc.,  NC)  at  2000  Hz  with  a  bandpass ﬁlter  (30–500  Hz;  24  dB/octave  roll-off)  from  electrodes  placed  on  the  skin  overlaying   the  orbicularis  oculi  muscle  under  the  right  eye.  Data  reduction  and  processing followed  published  guidelines  (Blumenthal  et  al.,  2005).  Ofﬂine  processing  included signal  epoching  (−50  ms  to  250  ms   period  surrounding  noise  probe),  rectiﬁcation and  smoothing  (30  Hz  lowpass  ﬁlter  following  rectiﬁcation),  and  baseline  correction.   Trials  with  no  responses  (i.e.,  peak  of  startle  response  is  less  than  or  equal  to  ␮V the  maximum  response  during  the  baseline  period)  or  deﬂections  greater  than  10  (i.e.,   artifact)  in  the  50  ms  pre-probe  baseline  were  rejected.  Prior  to  arriving  at  the ﬁnal   sample  of  84,  two  participants  were  removed  from  the  sample  because  more than  20%  of  their  probe  trials  contained  excessive  artifact.  Peak  eyeblink  response between  20  and  120  ms  post-probe  onset  was  scored  relative  to  mean  50  ms  preprobe  baseline.  Fear  potentiated  startle  (FPS)  was  scored  as  the  difference  between the   threat  (red  box)  and  no  threat  (green  box)  trials.  2.1.6.  Data  analysis  All  analyses  were  performed  with  SPSS  software  (SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL)  and  were analyzed  in  a  General  Linear  Model  (GLM)  with  Focus  and  Time  as  within-subject categorical  factors  and  Externalizing  (Externalizing;  continuous  and  standardized) as   a  between-subject  quantitative  factor.  Fear  response  to  threat  cues  was  indexed by   FPS,  which  was  calculated  by  subtracting  blink-response  magnitude  to  probes  following  green  (no  threat)  boxes  from  blink-response  magnitude  to  probes  following red   (threat)  boxes.  Potential  outliers  were  detected  using  studentized  residuals  with Bonferroni  corrected  p-values  <  05  and  were  subsequently  excluded  from  analysis.  2.2.  Results  The  effect  of  Focus  on  FPS  was   not  signiﬁcant  (F(1,83)  =  .74, p  =  .39);  nor  was   the  effect  of  Time  (F(1,83)  =  1.87,  p  =  .18)  indicating that  FPS  was   comparable  across  these  task  manipulations.  The  main effect  of  Externalizing  was  not  signiﬁcant  (F(1,82)  =  .04,  p  =  .842), indicating  that  Externalizing  scores  were  not  consistently  related to  FPS  across  conditions  (Hypothesis  1).  However,  a  signiﬁcant  three-way  interaction  indicated  that  the Externalizing  effect  was   moderated  by  both  focus  of  attention and  timing  of  goal-relevant  information  (F(1,82)  =  8.84,  p  =  .004, p2 =  .097).  In  order  to  unpack  the  signiﬁcant  three-way,  we   examine  the  two-way  interaction  between  timing  and  Externalizing within  each  focus  (i.e.,  threat  and  alternative).  Additionally,  we report  the  linear  regression  coefﬁcients  as  an  index  of  effect  size within  each  interaction  (Table  2  shows  raw  startle  responses  as  a function  of  threat,  condition,  and  externalizing).1  In  contrast  to  the  predictions  based  on  the  executive  functioning hypothesis,  there  was  no  main  effect  of  Externalizing  in  the  Alternative  Focus  conditions  (F(1,82)  =  .11,  p  =  .74)  (Hypothesis  2).  Also,  1 Analysis  of  the  behavioral  data  revealed  that  there  were  no  externalizing-related effects  on  behavioral  performance  (reaction  time  (F(3,246)  =  1.69,  p  =  .17)  or  accuracy  (F(3,246)  =  .77,  p  =  .51)).  Additionally,  results  for  all  of  the  primary  analyses were  essentially  unaltered  when  measures  of  intelligence  (Shipley  WAIS-R  estimate,  Zachary,  1986)  or  working  memory  (score  on  digit  backwards)  were  entered into  the  models.  52  A.R.

There  was  a  signiﬁcant  difference  between  the  Threat  and  No  Threat  stimuli  across  conditions,  F(1,86)  =  46.72, p   <  .001,  p2 =  .35,  which  indicated  that  startle  was   greater  in  the  Threat  trials  than  the  No  Threat  trials.  Because  we  analyzed  externalizing  continuously  instead  of  using  an extreme-groups  design,  the  values  presented  are  point  estimates  (i.e.,  estimated  using  regression  analyses)  for  low  and  high  externalizing  points  (1.5  SD  below  and  above the   sample  mean  NA-CON  total  score,  respectively)  on  the  distribution.  Numbers  in  parentheses  are  standard  errors.  study  did  not  produce  such  evidence.  That  is,  across  conditions, externalizing  was  not  consistently  associated  with  exaggerated reactivity  to  emotion  stimuli.  Similarly,  although  research  frequently  identiﬁes  executive  functioning  deﬁcits  as  the  underlying process  responsible  for  externalizing  dysfunction,  in  the  current study,  individuals  high  on  externalizing  traits  were  as  able  as  individuals  low  on  externalizing  traits  to  focus  on  the  goal-relevant information  and  resolve  competing  demands  by  ignoring  distracting  emotion  cues  in  the  Alternative  Focus  conditions.  The  present  results  do,  however,  appear  consistent  with  the attention  hypothesis.  According  to  this  model,  externalizers  overprioritize  goal-relevant,  motivationally  signiﬁcant  information  and so  are  primed  to  allocate  attention  more  strongly  than  other individuals  to  that  information.  Thus,  when  the  presentation  of goal-relevant  information  coincides  with  their  pre-existing  priorities,  individuals  high  on  trait  externalizing  display  emotional hyper-reactivity  (i.e.,  signiﬁcantly  more  FPS  in  the  Early  Threat Focus  condition).  Conversely,  when  a  stimulus  occurs  that  is  at odds  with  this  goal  (i.e.,  mismatch  between  pre-existing  prioritization  of  motivationally  signiﬁcant  information  and  actual  stimulus), the  over-prioritization  of  attention  toward  motivationally  signiﬁcant  information  might  diminish  the  resources  available  for re-allocating  attention  (i.e.,  employing  executive  control)  to  facilitate  goal-directed  behavior.  Ultimately,  this  attentional  response would  inhibit  ﬂuent  processing,  disrupt  the  processing  of  goaldirected  motivationally  signiﬁcant  information,  and  undermine  the threat  response.  In  the  present  study,  there  was  some  evidence  of the  affective  disruption,  presumably  as  a  consequence  of  the  attentional  response,  in  the  trend-level  effect  found  in  the  Late  Threat Focus  condition.  Overall,  this  attentional  response  appears  to  exaggerate  emotional  reactivity  when  information  is  congruent  with pre-existing  processing  priorities,  but  interfere  with  resource  allocation  and  processing  when  information  is  incongruent  with  those priorities.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  effect  of  this  attention  response  is not  evident  in  the  Alternative  Focus  conditions,  suggesting  that the  speciﬁc  attentional  abnormality  operating  in  externalizing is  not  simply  associated  with  an  over-allocation  of  attention  to motivationally  signiﬁcant  information.  If  this  was  the  case,  then emotion  hyper-reactivity  should  have  been  apparent  when  the threat  appeared  ﬁrst  but  was  not  goal-relevant  (Late  Alternative  Focus),  but  there  were  no  externalizing-related  differences in  this  condition.  Rather,  the  results  indicate  that  the  attentional anomaly  is  only  apparent  when  motivationally  signiﬁcant  information  conforms  to  goal-related  expectations.  Such  ﬁndings  suggest the  match  between  pre-existing  priorities  and  the  presentation  of information  that  ﬁts  those  priorities  is  the  key  factor  responsible for  over-allocation  of  attention.  However,  it  is  possible  that  this over-prioritization  of  attention  is  also  present  in  the  Alternative Focus  conditions,  but  fails  to  engender  emotion  hyper-reactivity  in  Fig.  2.

Error  bars  represent  estimates  for  low  and  high  Externalizing.  there  was  no  difference  in  the  relationship  between  Externalizing and  FPS  in  the  Early  Alternative  Focus  versus  Late  Alternative  Focus condition,  F(1,82)  =  1.35,  p  =  .249,  p␩2 =  .016.  However,  in  line  with the  attentional  predictions  there  was  a  signiﬁcant  Externalizingrelated  difference  in  FPS  in  the  Early  Threat  Focus  versus  Late  Threat Focus  condition,  F(1,82)  =  11.62,  p  =  .001,  p2 =  .12  (Hypothesis  3). Moreover,  the  simple  effect  of  Externalizing  within  the  Early Threat  Focus  condition  was  signiﬁcant  (B  =  5.52  p  =  .027,  p2 =  .06), indicating  that  individuals  high  on  Externalizing  demonstrated  signiﬁcantly  greater  FPS  in  the  Early  Threat  Focus  condition  (Fig.  2). The  relationship  between  Externalizing  and  FPS  in  the  Late  Threat −5.55,  p  =  .084,  p2 =  .04),  suggestFocus  condition  was  a  trend  (B  =  ing  that  externalizers  displayed  diminished  FPS  in  this  condition.2  2.3.  Discussion  Based  on  previous  research,  we  might  have  expected  to  ﬁnd  a global  emotional  hyper-reactivity  in  externalizing,  but  the  present  2 Externalizing  traits  and  psychopathy  have  many  behavioral  similarities  and  are often  conﬂated  in  the  literature.  However,  recent  evidence  suggests  that  the  etiological   underpinnings  of  these  dimensions  are  different  (Baskin-Sommers  and  Newman, in   press).  In  light  of  their  symptom  overlap  and  some  overlap  in  participants  between this  and  the  Baskin-Sommers  et  al.  (2011)  study,  it  seemed  important  to  compare  and  control  for  their  respective  cognitive-emotional  interactions  in  this  study. Scores  on  Hare’s  Psychopathy  Checklist-Revised  (2003;  Hare,  2003)  were  entered into  the  statistical  model  as  a  covariate  in  order  to  control  for  the  effect  of  psychopathy  and  estimate  the  unique  effect  of  externalizing,  as  well  as  to  compare  the cognition–emotion  interactions  in  psychopathy  and  externalizing,  respectively.  The unique  effects  of  externalizing  remained  signiﬁcant  and  were  independent  of  the psychopathy-related  FPS.  A.R.  Baskin-Sommers  et  al.  /  Biological  Psychology  91 (2012) 48–  58  53  externalizing  individuals.  For  instance,  it  is  possible  that  individuals  with  high  externalizing  traits  initially  over-allocate  attention  to the  goal-irrelevant  threat  cues  (i.e.,  colored  box),  but  do  not  dwell on  the  threat-relevant  information  when  their  pre-potent  focus involves  detecting  goal-relevant,  neutral  cues  (i.e.,  letter  case). Thus,  motivationally  signiﬁcant  cues  may   be  less  likely  to  command  their  attention  when  they  are  actively  involved  in  pursuing alternative  goals.  Overall,  these  ﬁndings  specify  an  important  dynamic  underlying  the  dysfunctional  cognitive-affective  interactions  associated with  externalizing  traits.  Speciﬁcally,  an  over-prioritization  and over-allocation  of  limited  capacity  processing  resources  to  motivationally  signiﬁcant  stimuli  exacerbates  emotional  reactions  and may,  paradoxically,  decrease  cognitive  resources  available  for  regulating  executive  control  and  emotional  reactions.  Further,  the emotional  dysregulation  seems  most  apparent  when  emotion information  is  related  to  the  primary  goal  (e.g.,  in  this  task  during Threat  Focus  conditions,  in  real  life  possibly  when  drug  seeking, when  gambling  to  attain  money).  The  fact  that  the  response  to threat  mimics  the  exaggerated  responsivity  to  rewards  commonly seen  in  externalizing  suggests  that  this  attentional  response  may be  a  general  mechanism  operating  in  externalizing.  Given  that  this is  a  new  ﬁnding,  though,  it  is  important  to  replicate  it  and  expand our  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  at  play.  3.  Study  2:  fMRI  Results  from  Study  1  support  a  novel  framework  for  understanding  the  emotionally  reactive  disinhibition  associated  with externalizing.  In  light  of  the  newness  of  this  proposal  it  is  important to  replicate  the  ﬁndings  and  examine  the  neural  processes  implicated  in  this  cognition–emotion  interaction.  The  focus  of  Study  2  is to  measure  brain  activity  in  key  regions  associated  with  affective responding,  executive  functioning,  and  attention  during  performance  on  the  task  that  revealed  externalizing-related  differences in  Study  1.  The  amygdala  and  regions  of  the  prefrontal  cortex  play  an important  role  in  emotional  processing,  and  have  been  found  to be  differentially  activated  in  individuals  with  externalizing  psychopathology  (Lindquist  et  al.,  2012;  Phan  et  al.,  2003;  Walter  et  al., 2009).  The  amygdala  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  emotional  modulation  of  attention  (Anderson  and  Phelps,  2001)  and  the  extended amygdala  is  a  key  modulator  of  measures  such  as  fear  potentiated  startle  (Anderson  and  Phelps,  2001;  Davis  et  al.,  1993;  Davis and  Whalen,  2001;  Grillon  et  al.,  1994).  While  many  regions  of  the prefrontal  cortex  are  important  for  attention,  executive  function, and  detection  of  emotional  salience,  recently,  a  number  of  studies  have  identiﬁed  the  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC)  as  a key  region  in  the  allocation  of  attention  to  motivationally  signiﬁcant  information,  particularly  as  it  relates  to  the  expression  of  fear (Etkin  et  al.,  2011;  Hanson  et  al.,  2010;  Milad  et  al.,  2007;  Walter et  al.,  2009).  This  region  also  aids  in  the  monitoring  and  resolution of  conﬂict  in  the  environment  (Blair,  2008;  Cohen  et  al.,  2000).  Speciﬁcally  with  regard  to  externalizing,  some  research  highlights  an  externalizing-related  association  between  reduced  gray matter  volumes  in  the  right  amygdala  and  functional  amygdala hyperactivity  (Benegal  et  al.,  2007;  Coccaro  et  al.,  2007;  Raine et  al.,  1998;  Sterzer  et  al.,  2005).  Additionally,  studies  often  report prefrontal  (i.e.,  dmPFC)  abnormalities,  both  hypo-and-hyper  activation,  among  individuals  high  on  externalizing  traits  (Bufkin  and Luttrell,  2005;  Davidson  et  al.,  2003;  Herpertz  et  al.,  2008;  Raine et  al.,  2000).  In  the  present  study,  we  investigated  whether  the  pattern of  activation  in  key  regions  such  as  the  amygdala  and  dmPFC would  track  the  predictions  related  to  the  attention  model  and  results  reported  in  Study  1.  If  individuals  with  high  trait externalizing  are  associated  with  an  over-allocation  of  attention and  hyper-reactivity  to  goal-relevant-threat  cues  as  found  in  Study 1,  then  they  should  display  increased  amygdala  and  dmPFC  activation  in  the  Early  Threat  Focus  condition.  However,  in  the  Late Threat  Focus  condition  amygdala  and  dmPFC  activation  would  be reduced,  reﬂecting  a  disruption  in  attentional-affective  processing  when  information  that  does  not  match  the  motivational  set appears.  Lastly,  based  on  the  results  from  Study  1  and  the  attentional  hypothesis,  there  should  be  no  speciﬁc  externalizing-related effects  (i.e.,  comparable  amygdala  and  dmPFC  activation  in  low  and high  trait  externalizing  individuals)  associated  with  the  Alternative  Focus  conditions,  as  these  conditions  are  more  associated  with executive  functioning  demands  (i.e.,  competition  between  goalrelevant  focus  and  peripheral  goal-irrelevant  threat  information).  3.1.  Methods  3.1.1.  Participants  Participants  were  37  male  inmates  from  a  maximum-security  prison  in  southern  Wisconsin.  (Note:  This  sample  was   drawn  from  a  different  institution  than  the sample  in  Study  1.)  In  addition  to  the  exclusion  criteria  listed  in  Study  1,  participants  were  also  excluded  from  the  imaging  study  if  they  had  contraindications  for MRI   (e.g.,  ferromagnetic  or  electronic  implants).  The  fMRI  sample  was  collected  at  a  different  institution,  where  other  measures of   externalizing  were  administered.  For  this  sample,  externalizing  was  measured using  the  Externalizing  Spectrum  Inventory  (ESI;  Hall  et  al.,  2007).  The  ESI  is  a  100item  self-report  questionnaire  developed  to  assess  a  broad  range  of  behavioral  (i.e., substance  use)  and  personality  characteristics  (i.e.,  alienation,  rebelliousness,  and impulsivity)  associated  with  the  externalizing  spectrum  of  psychopathology.  The 100-item  version  was  derived  from  Krueger  et  al’s  (2007)  415-item  self-report  measure  and  is  correlated  r  =  .98  with  the  original  measure  (Krueger  et  al.,  2007).3 For this  sample  the  internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s  alpha)  was   .96.  3.1.2.  Shock  sensitivity  Prior  to  beginning  the  experiment,  the  intensity  of  shocks  received  during  the experimental  session  was  calibrated  to  a  participant’s  subjective  shock  sensitivity.  The  shock  sensitivity  procedure  was  the  same  as  Study  1.  However,  due  to  the scanner  environment  shocks  were  delivered  via  an  AC  source  (Contact  Precision Instruments,  Boston,  MA)   through  two  Ag/AgCl  electrodes  placed  over  the  right tibial  nerve  over  the  right  medial  malleolus  (right  ankle).  3.1.3.   Instructed  fear-conditioning  task  Presentation  of  stimuli  and  recording  of  responses  were  controlled  by  ePrime software  (Psychological  Software  Tools).  Stimuli  were  presented  via  a  rear  projection  screen  and  responses  were  recorded  with  a  ﬁber  optic  response  box.  The instructed  fear  task  was  essentially  like  the  one  presented  in  Study  1.  However,  in order  to  adapt  the  task  to  a  scanner  setting,  each  condition  had  only  60  trials  and  a ﬁxation  cross  was  displayed  for  400–1200  ms  (mean  =  800  ms)   at  the  beginning  of each  trial.  Twenty  percent  of  the  trials  where  shocked  and  no  white  noise  probes where  administered  in  the  imaging  study.  ×   24  cm,  64   ×   64  matrix,  3.75  mm   Image  acquisition:  Data  were  collected  on  the  Mind  Research  Network’s  1.5  T Siemens  Avanto  scanner  with  advanced  SQ  gradients  (max  slew  rate  200  T/m/s, 346   T/m/s  vector  summation,  rise  time  us)  with  a  12-element  head  coil.  EPI  echoplanar  functional  images  were  collected  according  to  the  following  parameters:  TR/TE × (2000/39  ms,   ﬂip  angle  75◦,  FOV  24  cm    3.75  mm in  plane  resolution,  5  mm  slice  thickness,  27  axial  oblique  slices).  Head  motion  was limited  using  padding.  High-resolution  MPRAGE  structural  images  were  obtained to   cover  the  whole  brain  with  128  1-mm  sagittal  slices,  8◦ ﬂip  angle  and  24  cm  FOV. Image  preprocessing:  All  fMRI  data  pre-processing  and  analysis  was   conducted with  AFNI  software  (Cox,  1996).  After  image  reconstruction  and  slice-time  correction,  rigid-body  motion  correction  was  done  in  three  translational  and  three rotational  directions,  with  all  images  registered  to  the  ﬁfth  functional  image.  The amount  of  motion  in  these  directions  was  estimated  and  then  included  as  regressors  in  subsequent  analyses.  Participants  with  more  than  3  mm  displacement  were excluded.  Functional  timeseries  were  deconvolved  using  a  tent  function  including  8  3 There  are  a  variety  of  psychometric  approaches  for  characterizing  externalizing (e.g.,  using  CON,  Impulsive  Antisociality,  NA-CON  difference  score,  ESI),  and  currently  there  is  no  agreed  upon  gold  standard.  There  is  existing  evidence  that  the  ESI and  MPQ   NA-CON  measures  tap  the  same  underlying  construct  and  are  moderately to   strongly  correlated  (Venables  and  Patrick,  2011).  In  our  dataset,  using  a  different sample  of  participants  who  recently  completed  both  measures,  but  did  not  complete  either  of  the  present  studies,  the  correlation  between  the  two   measures  was, r(326)  =  .60.  54  A.R.

A  spatial  blur  of  4  mm  full  width half   maximum  was   applied  and  images  were  resampled  to  1  mm3 voxels.  Anatomical images  for  each  participant  were  nonlinearly  transformed  to  Talairach  space  using the   TT  N27  template  and  each  functional  run  was  transformed  to  the  Talairachtransformed  anatomical  image.  One  participant  did  not  have  usable  anatomical scans  so  the  functional  images  were  transformed  to  a  standard  Talairach  (TT N27) template.

Data  analysis  Participants  were  grouped  into  high  and  low  externalizing  traits  based  on  a median  split  of  externalizing  scores  on  the  ESI  (N  =  19  individuals  low  on  external× izing;  N  =  18  individuals  high  on  externalizing).  First,  a  Group    Condition  ANOVA was   run.  Based  on  this  ANOVA,  parameter  estimates  for  regions  relevant  to  the hypothesized  mechanisms  were  extracted  for  signiﬁcant  clusters  identiﬁed  in  the ×   Condition  interaction.  Analyses  were  focused  on  amygdala  and  dmPFC  clusGroup  × ters,  however  Table  3  displays  all  clusters  with  a  signiﬁcant  Group    Condition interaction.  For  all  whole  brain  analyses,  cluster  thresholding  was   applied  to  correct  for  multiple  comparisons  using  the  Alphasim  procedure  in  AFNI  with  the following  input  parameters:  voxel-based  p  <  .025,  nearest-neighbor  selection  criteria,   and  estimated  smoothing  parameters  of  x  =  4.066,  y  =  4.621,  and  z  =  4.755.  Spatial smoothness  was  estimated  by  calculating  full  width  half  max   on  the  residual  timeseries  (noise)  generated  following  deconvolution.  3.2.  Results  and  discussion  Consistent  with  the  FPS  results,  there  was  no  main  effect of  externalizing  on  amygdala  (F(1,35)  =  .02,  p  =  .88)  or  dmPFC (F(1,35)  =  1.57,  p  =  .22)  activation.  Signiﬁcant  three-way  interactions  in  the  amygdala  (F(1,35)  =  6.77,  p  =  .01,  p2 =  .16)  and  dmPFC (F(1,35)  =  4.74,  p  =  .04,  p2 =  .12),  respectively,  indicated  that  the Externalizing  effect  was  moderated  by  both  focus  of  attention and  timing  of  goal-relevant  information.  Next,  in  order  to  unpack the  signiﬁcant  three-way  interactions,  we  examine  the  twoway  interactions  between  timing  and  Externalizing  within  each focus  (i.e.,  threat  and  alternative).  Of  note,  like  Study  1,  none × of  the  Group    Condition  interactions  in  the  Alternative  Focus  conditions  were  signiﬁcant  dmPFC:  F(1,35)  =  .59,  p  =  .45).  (amygdala:  F(1,35)  =  .40,  p  =  .53;  for  Group   −8,  y  =   ×   Condition   interaction  cluster:  x  =  15,  y  =   Moreover,  like  the  FPS  results  in  Study  1,  there  were  significant  amygdala  (F(1,  35)  =  28.55,  p  <  .001  uncorrected,  p2 =  .45; −6, peak  −12;  a  region  including  parahippocampal  gyrus)  and  dmPFC z  =  × (F(1,35)  =  13.63,  p  =  .001,  p2 =  .28;  peak  for  Group    Condition −18,  z  =  54)  differences  found  for interaction  cluster:  x  =  the  Early  versus  Late  Threat  Focus  contrast.  First,  in  the  Early Threat  Focus  condition,  individuals  high  on  externalizing  exhibited  signiﬁcantly  more  amygdala  activation  than  individuals  low on  externalizing  (F(1,35)  =  7.81,  p  =  .008,  p2 =  .18).  Conversely,  in the  Late  Threat  Focus  condition,  individuals  high  on  externalizing exhibited  signiﬁcantly  less  amygdala  activation  than  individuals  low  on  externalizing  (F(1,35)  =  8.69,  p  =  .006,  p2 =  .20;  Fig.  3). Second,  in  the  Early  Threat  Focus  condition  individuals  high  on externalizing  traits  also  exhibited  signiﬁcantly  more  activation  in the  dmPFC  than  individuals  low  on  externalizing  (F(1,35)  =  9.16, p  =  .005,  p2 =  .21),  whereas  in  the  Late  Threat  Focus  condition individuals  high  on  externalizing  exhibited  signiﬁcantly  less  activation  in  the  dmPFC  region  than  individuals  low  on  externalizing (F(1,35)  =  9.67,  p  =  .004,  p2 =  .22;  Fig.  4).4  The  results   imaging  study  are  consistent  with the  FPS  ﬁndings  from  Study  1  and  reinforce  the  tenets  of the  attention  hypothesis.  Again  there  was  no  evidence  for  an  from  this   4 Due  to  software  limitations  we   are  not  able  to  run  a  voxel-wise  continuous regression-based  reduction  (like  the  analyses  in  Study  1).  However,  we  recognize that  some  researchers  caution  against  the  use  of  a  median  split.  Thus,  we   identiﬁed the  amygdala  and  dmPFC  clusters  (region  of  interest  pairwise  approach),  extracted them,  and  ran  the  simple  effect  analyses  with  externalizing  as  a  continuous  covariate.  As  with  the  analysis  reported  in  the  main  text,  there  was  a  signiﬁcant  interaction between  externalizing  and  time  for  the  Threat  Focus  in  the  amygdala  (i.e.,  Early Threat  Focus  versus  Late  Threat  Focus,  F(1,35)  =  10.70,  p  =  .002,  p2 =  .23).  The  Early Threat  Focus  versus  Late  Threat  Focus  effect  in  the  dmPFC  was  reduced  to  a  trend, F(1,35)  =  2.93,  p  =  .09,  p2 =  .08.  There  were  no  main  effects  of  externalizing  or  effects of   externalizing  in  the  Alternative  Focus  conditions  for  either  region  of  interest.  A.R.

(B)  The  bar  graph  depicts  mean  threat  minus ×   Condition  interaction.  Error  bars  represent  standard  error  of  externalizing-related  difference  in  global  emotional  reactivity  (i.e., main  effect  across  conditions)  or  deﬁcit  in  executive  functioning (i.e.,  effects  in  the  Alternative  Focus  conditions).  However,  like  in Study  1,  individuals  with  high  externalizing  traits  compared  to  individuals  with  low  externalizing  traits  displayed  greater  amygdala and  dmPFC  activation  when  asked  to  focus  directly  on  the  threat and  the  threat  appeared  ﬁrst  (i.e.,  when  there  was  a  match  between pre-existing  priorities  and  presentation  of  motivationally  significant,  goal-relevant  information).  Both  amygdala  and  dmPFC  are important  neural  regions  reﬂecting  attention–emotion  interactions (Etkin  et  al.,  2011).  Given  the  role  of  these  regions  in  integrating  attentional  and  affective  responses,  increased  activation  in  the Early  Threat  Focus  condition  among  externalizing  individuals  may reﬂect,  at  a  neural  level,  the  dysfunctional  process  that  occurs  when there  is  a  match  between  pre-existing  priorities  and  goal-relevant stimuli.  Moreover,  in  the  Early  Threat  Focus  condition,  brain  regions implicated  in  the  mesolimbic  dopamine  system  (i.e.,  Caudate  and Substantia  Nigra,  see  Table  3),  a  system  involved  in  integrating information  about  motivational  salience,  were  hyper-activated  in the  high  externalizing  group.  This  evidence  is  consistent  with  previous  work  that  found  signiﬁcantly  greater  neural  activation in  this  system  among  externalizers  (i.e.,  high  impulsive  traits) during  the  presentation  of  “behaviorally  relevant  environmental reinforcers”  (p.  3,  Buckholtz  et  al.,  2010b).   Thus,  in  conjunction with  the  primary  analyses,  the  overall  pattern  of  neural  activation in  externalizers  suggests  widespread  hyper-reactivity  in  regions related  to  the  detection,  processing,  and  regulation  of  motivational salience,  particularly  when  the  motivationally  signiﬁcant  stimuli match  pre-existing  priorities.  Conversely,  in  the  Late  Threat  Focus  condition,  when  participants  were  primed  to  focus  on  threat  but  an  irrelevant  distractor appeared  ﬁrst,  deﬁcits  in  allocating  attention,  executive  control, and  affective  regulation  were  evident  in  high  trait  externalizing,  as indicated  by  decreased  amygdala  and  dmPFC  activation.  Previous studies  suggest  that  reduction  in  dmPFC  activation  is  prominent when  threat  processing  occurs  under  cognitive  load  (e.g.,  due  to conﬂict  in  the  environment;  Etkin  et  al.,  2011).  In  the  Late  Threat Focus  condition,  reduced  dmPFC  activation  may  indicate  that  externalizing  individuals  are  over-reacting  to  the  presence  of  conﬂict (i.e.,  mismatch  between  goal  and  environmental  stimuli).  That  is,  Fig.  4.

Baskin-Sommers  et  al.  /  Biological  Psychology  91 (2012) 48–  58  because  externalizing  individuals  prioritize  affective  stimuli,  they must  dedicate  more  resources  to  reorienting  attention  toward  goaldirected  information  when  distracting  or  irrelevant  information is  presented.  Ultimately  this  capacity-demanding  process  results in  a  disruption  in  emotion  responding  (i.e.,  reﬂected  in  reduced amygdala  and  dmPFC  activation;  Blair,  2007;  Corbetta  et  al.,  2008). One  issue  deserving  further  consideration  is  the  weak  amygdala activation  to  threat  versus  safe  stimuli  in  Early  Threat  Focus  condition  in  the  low  externalizing  group.  It  might  be  expected  that  when directly  focusing  on  threat,  amygdala  activation  in  the  low  externalizing  group  would  be  greater  to  the  threat  than  safe  stimuli. However,  two  factors  are  important  to  consider  in  this  case.  First, some  research  reports  decreased  response  to  threat  stimuli  and postulate  that  this  reﬂects  the  attentional  demands  associated  with regulating  affective  responses  (Delgado  et  al.,  2008).  The  present task  is  verbally  demanding  and  given  the  attentional  manipulations,  the  demands  on  regulating  attention  and  affect  may   have impacted  the  pattern  of  amygdala  activation  in  the  low  externalizing  group.  Second,  this  pattern  of  amygdala  activation  may   not be  surprising  given  the  nature  of  the  sample.  Virtually  none  of  the previously  published  fMRI  studies  examining  threat-  and  affectrelated  amygdala  activation  used  an  incarcerated  control  group (Birbaumer  et  al.,  2005;  Deeley  et  al.,  2006;  Muller  et  al.,  2003)  and fMRI  studies  using  incarcerated  samples  fail  to  show  a  consistent pattern  in  terms  of  amygdala  activation.  Thus,  it  is  unclear  what the  expected  pattern  of  amygdala  activity  in  incarcerated  samples is,  although  this  certainly  warrants  further  study.  Regardless,  the effects  within  the  high  externalizing  group  are  highly  consistent across  two  studies  and  with  a  theoretical  model  that  posits  an anomalous  attention  response  is  driving  emotion  dysregulation  in these  individuals.  4.  General  discussion  Across  two  studies  using  highly  similar  tasks  but  different  prison samples,  assessments  of  externalizing,  and  measures  of  emotional  reactivity,  we  traced  the  disinhibited  emotional  responses associated  with  externalizing  traits  to  the  same  dysfunctional cognitive-affective  interaction.  As  expected,  individuals  with  high levels  of  externalizing  displayed  exaggerated  emotional  reactivity,  but  this  ﬁnding  was  highly  speciﬁc  and  thus  provided  little support  for  the  hypothesis  that  externalizing  involves  global  hyperreactivity  to  motivationally  signiﬁcant  stimuli  (i.e.,  Hypothesis  1). Moreover,  we  found  no  support  for  the  hypothesis  that  a  deﬁcit  in executive  functioning  would  interfere  with  the  ability  of  externalizers  to  inhibit  emotionally  salient  distractors  while  performing  a task  that  required  them  to  maintain  a  goal-directed  focus  on  emotionally  neutral  stimuli  (i.e.,  Hypothesis  2).  In  contrast  to  these  more general  hypotheses,  the  association  between  exaggerated  emotion reactivity  and  externalizing  traits  was  found  to  vary  as  a  function  of  attentional  focus  and  stimulus  order.  That  is,  consistent with  Hypothesis  3,  our  results  indicate  that  the  over-allocation  of attention  to  anticipated  threat  stimuli  set  up  the  dysregulation  in executive  functioning  and  emotional  hyper-reactivity.  This  is  not  to deny  that  in  certain  contexts  externalizers  appear  to  have  executive functioning  deﬁcits  (e.g.,  Endres  et  al.,  2011);  but  the  results  of  the present  study  suggest  that  externalizing  traits  are  associated  with emotional  hyper-reactivity  largely  due  to  their  exaggerated  attentional  response  and  that  this  response  may   explain  the  apparent executive  functioning  deﬁcits  in  other  studies  (i.e.,  over-allocation of  attentional  resources  to  speciﬁc  stimuli  would  reduce  the  available  resources  for  executive  functions).  While  it  is  premature  to  specify  the  exact  attentional  mechanism  responsible  for  the  attentional  response  in  externalizing, it  interesting  to  speculate  about  the  type  of  attentional  is   processes  underlying  the  cascade  of  events  that  culminate  in  emotion  reactivity.  In  general,  models  of  selective  attention  hold  that information  competes  for  limited  processing  resources,  and  particularly  at  later  stages  of  attention,  this  competition  is  tightly coupled  with  demands  on  limited-capacity  cognitive  (i.e.,  executive  functioning)  resources  (Desimone  and  Duncan,  1995).  Emotion information  appears  to  be  privileged  in  this  respect  and  typically  takes-hold  of  perceptual  and  attentional  resources  (Pessoa, 2009).  Moreover,  individual  differences,  such  as  externalizing,  may modulate  responsivity  to  emotion  information.  Thus,  in  situations where  motivationally  signiﬁcant  stimuli  (e.g.,  threats  or  rewards) are  particularly  salient  or  intrinsically  important  to  an  individual,  the  emotion  information  commands  processing  resources  and reduces  the  resources  available  for  other  functions  (i.e.,  executive functions).  As  a  result,  the  engagement  of  executive  resources  to control  and  inhibit  the  response  to  emotion  information  is  hampered  (see  Wallace  and  Newman,  1997).  Overall,  the  regulation  of affective  reactions  will  depend  upon  the  application  of  resources associated  with  executive  control/function,  but  the  current  ﬁndings  suggest  that  for  externalizers  these  downstream  effects  begin with  an  over-allocation  of  resources  at  the  perceptual/attentional stage.  The  present  emphasis  on  attention  as  the  crucial/controlling process  underlying  externalizing-related  emotional  reactivity  ﬁts well  with  externalizers’  tendency  to  over-react  in  emotionally charged  situations.  To  illustrate  the  potential  relevance  of  such cognitive–emotion  interactions  for  behavior,  we  consider  their implications  for  aggressive  behaviors.  Individuals  high  on  externalizing  are  prone  to  display  reactive  aggression,  which  typically involves  a  reaction  to  frustration  or  threat  (Blair,  2001).  Models  for reactive  aggression  assume  roles  for  executive  functions  (i.e.,  cognitive  control;  Giancola  et  al.,  1996)  and  emotion  systems  (Blair, 2001;  Dougherty  et  al.,  2004).  In  essence,  the  combination  of  poor inhibitory  control  and  an  inability  to  process  and  manage  emotions  effectively,  particularly  frustration,  results  in  the  disinhibited expression  of  aggressive  responses.  One  implication  of  the  current ﬁndings  is  that  externalizers’  tendency  to  over-focus  attention  on motivationally  signiﬁcant  cues,  such  as  a  threat  or  an  insult,  may reduce  their  capacity  for  executive  functioning  and  emotion  regulation  (i.e.,  not  thinking  before  acting).  Research  suggests  that some  individuals  with  externalizing  are  hyper-sensitive  to  interpersonal  slights  and  provocations  (i.e.,  hostile  attribution  style; Dodge,  2006).  Thus,  if  an  individual  with  externalizing  experiences a  slight  or  insult  in  the  context  of  an  interpersonal  interaction, they  may   over-allocate  attention  to  that  insult,  have  difﬁculty  using executive  functioning  to  regulate  their  reaction  to  the  insult,  and behave  in  a  hyper-emotional  way  (i.e.,  display  reactive  aggression).  Furthermore,  this  reaction  may   exist  for  any  “trigger”  that  is over-prioritized  for  an  externalizing  individual  (e.g.,  a  substancedependent  externalizer  may   over-allocate  attention  to  drug  cues and  display  disinhibited  reactions  in  response  to  these  speciﬁc cues).  One  limitation  of  the  current  studies  is  that  our  assessment of  emotional  reactivity  was  restricted  to  fear  responses.  Given the  relationship  between  externalizing  and  hyper-reactivity  to rewards  and  drug  cues,  it  is  important  to  examine  emotion  dysregulation  in  the  context  of  appetitive  as  well  as  aversive  stimuli. However,  in  light  of  the  more  common  emphasis  on  reward stimuli,  the  present  results  indicating  dysregulated  reaction  in the  presence  of  aversive  stimuli  suggest  that  the  dysfunctional cognitive–affective  interactions  in  externalizing  may   be  more  general  than  previously  thought.  Second,  we  used  different,  albeit correlated  measures  of  externalizing  in  the  two   studies  (see  Footnote  3).  Be  that  as  it  may,  the  fact  that  the  two  studies  yielded consistent  results  speaks  to  the  robustness  of  our  ﬁndings  across diverse  externalizing  measures.  A.R.  Baskin-Sommers  et  al.  /  Biological  Psychology  91 (2012) 48–  58  57  interacting  attentional,  executive   In  conclusion,  cognition–emotion  interactions  involve  diverse and  function,  and  affectrelated  processes.  The  current  results  suggest  that  a  crucial interaction  affecting  the  disinhibited  emocognition–emotion  tional  reactivity  associated  with  trait  externalizing  involves  an over-prioritization  and  over-allocation  of  attention  toward  motivationally  signiﬁcant  cues.  This  attentional  response,  in  turn,  appears to  preclude  the  effective  utilization  of  executive  functions  (e.g.,  cognitive  control,  inhibition)  and  thus,  ultimately  culminates  in  the reactive  disinhibition  of  emotion  and  behavior.

Alterations in Theory-of-Mind (ToM), or mentalizing skills, are a hallmark feature of schizophrenia, and are also evident in individuals exposed to childhood trauma. However, the impact of childhood trauma exposure on brain function during social cognition in schizophrenia remains unclear. We thus examined the association between childhood trauma and brain function during the performance of a ToM task in 47 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an established visual-cartoon affective ToM task. Whole-brain multiple regression analysis was performed on ToM-related brain activation, with CTQ total score as regressor of interest, while accounting for the effects of age, sex, diagnosis, symptom severity, behavioural performance, intelligence and medications levels. First, using a small-volume correction approach within a mask made of key regions for ToM [including bilateral temporo-parietal junctions (TPJ), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/ precuneus], total CTQ scores were positively associated with activation of the PCC/precuneus. Second, exploratory analyses for the rest of the brain (i.e., ROIs masked-out), revealed a positive association between trauma exposure and activation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and a negative association with activation of the anterior section of the TPJ. These results suggest that childhood trauma exposure may, at least partially, contribute to functional alterations of brain regions essential for effective mental state inference in schizophrenia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction  Theory-of-Mind (ToM), or ‘mentalizing’, involves higher-order social cognitive processes to facilitate accurate understanding of others' thoughts, emotions and intentions (i.e., mental states), which in turn facilitates adaptive social behaviour (Wimmer and Perner, 1983). Deﬁcits in ToM are pervasive features of schizophrenia (Bora et al., 2009) that are known to impact social functioning (Couture et al., 2006) in both acute (Bora et al., 2009) and remitted patients (Sprong et al., 2007). Effective ToM processes are critically dependent on the functional  ⁎ Corresponding author at: School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales  Research Unit for Schizophrenia Epidemiology Randwick, NSW Australia.

The temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are common to both networks; however, the ‘affective ToM’ network also involves the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), ventral striatum, amygdala, temporal poles, while the ‘cognitive ToM’ network involves the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dorsal ACC (dACC) and the dorsal striatum (Abu-Akel and Shamay-Tsoory, 2011). A recent meta-analysis of neural activation in schizophrenia during ToM tasks (including 9 studies comparing 133 schizophrenia patients to 140 healthy controls) revealed increased activation of the PCC, the STS and somatosensory cortices, and decreased  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2017.02.012 0920-9964/© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Similarly increased activation in the PCC and the TPJ and decreased activation in the mPFC have been reported in unaffected ﬁrst-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia (Mohnke et al., 2016).  In non-psychotic populations, exposure to childhood trauma is commonly associated with deﬁcits on higher cognitive processes (executive functions, working memory or emotional processes) and associated brain regions (Hart and Rubia, 2012). Importantly, alterations of social cognitive skills are evident in maltreated youths (Benarous et al., 2015; Luke and Banerjee, 2013) and ostensibly healthy adults (Germine et al., 2015), and adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (Nazarov et al., 2014). Childhood maltreatment is associated with increased centrality (i.e., the importance of a node in a network) of the right precuneus and the right anterior insula, and reduced importance of the left ACC, in brain networks sustaining social cognitive skills (such as emotion regulation, mental state inference, ascribing intentions or beliefs to others; Teicher et al., 2014). Consistently, increased amygdala activation has been found in trauma-exposed patients with chronic depression performing an affective ToM task (Hentze et al., 2016), consistent with similar patterns of amygdala hyper-activation reported in trauma-exposed (healthy) individuals performing a facematching task (Dannlowski et al., 2012).  Exposure to childhood trauma is also a signiﬁcant risk factor for psychosis (Green et al., 2014; Read et al., 2014) that impacts morphology and function of key brain regions for cognition in these populations. In mixed samples of psychotic disorders (i.e., comprising schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic bipolar cases), exposure to sexual abuse has been associated with decreased grey matter in the left dlPFC and the ACC (Shefﬁeld et al., 2013), while exposure to any type of childhood trauma has been associated with increased activation of the left inferior parietal lobule when performing a working memory task (Quidé et al., 2016). In schizophrenia, exposure to emotional neglect has been associated with reduced grey matter volume of the right dlPFC (Cancel et al., 2015), while exposure to sexual abuse and physical neglect were associated with aberrant amygdala-PCC/precuneus functional connectivity during an emotion-processing task (Cancel et al., 2017). These regions show considerable overlap with brain regions implicated in ToM performance, suggesting that trauma-exposure may contribute to brain functional alterations associated with social cognitive impairments, as previously described in schizophrenia (Mrizak et al., 2016). Despite the high prevalence of trauma exposure in schizophrenia (Larsson et al., 2013; Matheson et al., 2013) and evidence for trauma-related ToM deﬁcits, the effects of childhood trauma on ToM brain function in schizophrenia have not yet been investigated.  We thus set out to investigate the effects of childhood trauma exposure on brain function associated with ToM processes in a sample of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Speciﬁcally, we investigated the associations between exposure to childhood trauma (Bernstein et al., 2003) and brain activation (blood oxygenation level dependent signal changes) occurring during the performance of a wellcharacterized and robust ToM task. Unlike its extended version (Schnell et al., 2011), the two conditions version of the ToM task used here, does not distinguish between affective and cognitive ToM processes (Mohnke et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2011). We expected that childhood trauma would be associated with increased activation within a mask of ToM-related key regions derived from van Overwalle's meta-analysis (Van Overwalle, 2009), including bilateral TPJ, the PCC/precuneus and the mPFC. We also explored the potential associations between childhood trauma exposure and activation of brain regions outside these regions.  2. Materials and methods  2.1. Participants  All participants provided informed consent according to procedures approved by the UNSW Human Research Ethics committees  (HC12384), the South East Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service (HREC 09/081) and St Vincent's Hospital (HREC/10/SVH/9). Participants were 47 clinical cases meeting ICD-10 criteria (W.H.O., 2008) for schizophrenia (n = 29) or schizoaffective disorder (n = 18), recruited from local area health services, the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB; Loughland et al., 2010) and by advertisement in the local community. Exclusion criteria included inability to communicate sufﬁciently in English, current neurological disorder, any history of head injuries with loss of consciousness, a diagnosis of substance abuse/dependence in the past six months, and having received electroconvulsive therapy in the previous six months.  2.2. Materials  Clinical diagnoses according to ICD-10 criteria were derived using the OPCRIT algorithm (McGufﬁn and Farmer, 1991) applied to interviewer ratings on the Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis (Castle et al., 2006). Current symptom severity was determined using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay et al., 1989), current Intellectual Quotient (IQ) levels were measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; Wechsler, 1999), and handedness was determined using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldﬁeld, 1971). Exposure to childhood trauma was measured using the short form (25 items) of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 2003). The CTQ is a self-report questionnaire that measures childhood (before age 12 years) trauma exposure on domains of emotional (EA), physical (PA) and sexual (SA) abuse, as well as physical (PN) and emotional (EN) neglect. For each domain, a score is calculated from 5 items, each rated with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 5 (very often true); responses within each domain were summed, and scores within the Moderate to Extreme range (i.e., EA N 12; PA N 9; SA N 7; EN N 14; PN N 9) on any one of these domains indicates signiﬁcant trauma severity (Mørkved et al., 2016; Quidé et al., 2016; Shannon et al., 2011). Due to high correlation among CTQ domains (Table 1) and because 38% of the present sample reported exposure to signiﬁcant trauma severity on multiple CTQ domains (Table 2), we used the CTQ total score for focal functional brain imaging analyses.  2.3. Theory-of-Mind (ToM) task  The ToM task was developed for use in functional neuroimaging studies (Schnell et al., 2011) and demonstrates excellent reliability (0.76 b ICC b 0.82) of ToM-related brain activity (Mohnke et al., 2014). In its shortened version with two conditions, that is, a control condition and an affective ToM condition (Mohnke et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2011), it does not distinguish between affective and cognitive ToM processes and is not particularly sensitive to behavioural performance (Mohnke et al., 2014). The task employed a block-design that alternates between 8 blocks of ‘ToM’ and 8 blocks of ‘Control’ conditions (total paradigm time: 480 s). Each block comprised 4 frames: an instruction frame (6.53 s), followed by a cartoon story in three consecutive frames (22.58 s; 7.53 s per image). For the control conditions, participants counted the number of living characters in the cartoon frames and determined if there was a change (same, more or less) between frames. For the ToM condition, participants were required to report whether the protagonist's affect would be expected to have changed according to the circumstances, by speciﬁcally indicating whether the affective state of the protagonist would be expected to be the same as, better, or worse than, the previous picture in the cartoon sequence. Pictures were free of direct emotional cues such as characters' facial expressions to avoid simple activation of emotion perception networks.  Stimuli were displayed on a Philips LCD monitor at the rear of the magnet, viewed by the participant via a standard head coil mirror. A Cedrus Lumina response box was used to measure behavioural responses. All participants underwent an “ofﬂine” task training session before the fMRI data acquisition. Accuracy in the different conditions  164  Y.

Images acquisition and processing  We acquired 240 whole-brain T2* weighted echo-planar images (EPI); slice thickness 4 mm, 0.3 mm gap, 32 axial slices in ascending order, TR 2000 ms, TE 30 ms, ﬂip angle 80°, matrix 96 × 96, ﬁeld of view 240 mm, on a Philips Achieva 3 T scanner, housed at Neuroscience Research Australia (Randwick, NSW, Australia). A high-resolution T1weighted anatomical scan (MPRAGE) was also obtained for each participant for registration and screening; TR 8.9 ms, TE 4.1 ms, ﬁeld of view 240 mm, matrix 268 × 268, 200 sagittal slices, slice thickness 0.9 mm (no gap).  Image processing and all analyses were performed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK; http://www. ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) in Matlab r2011b (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). The ﬁrst ﬁve volumes were automatically discarded to allow for magnetic stabilization. Following manual re-orientation to the AC-PC line, images for each participant were slice-timing corrected, realigned to the ﬁrst image in the sequence to help correct for head motion, and anatomical images were co-registered to the mean functional image. Scans were screened for stability (b2 mm head movement; b2° rotation), image artifact, and structural abnormalities and were then spatially normalised into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using a non-linear 12-parameter afﬁne transformation, re-sliced to 2 × 2 × 2 mm voxels and ﬁnally smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel set at 8 mm full-width half-maximum. After ﬁrst-level modeling, scans for all participants were additionally inspected for movements and intensity artifacts using the Artifact Detection Toolbox for SPM8 (ART; https://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/).

Only participants showing 10% or less outlier for each task condition separately, as well as for the whole run, were conserved for further analyses.  Finally, the data were high-pass ﬁltered using a cut-off of 128 s and the autoregressive (AR1) function was applied. To help account for movement and image intensity-related variance, the regressors obtained after ART inspection were added to the design matrix at the ﬁrstlevel; this includes regressors for movement (n = 6) and global signal intensity (n = 1) across all subjects, as well as individual potential outliers. Also, variance accounted for the instructions and the button presses were modelled as separate conditions and were added as regressors of no-interest to the design matrix. A ﬁrst-level (individual) step modelled contrasts for the different conditions (‘ToM’, ‘Control’, ‘ToM N Control’). Individual (‘ToM N Control’) contrasts were used in second-level steps.  2.5. Analyses  Whole-brain multiple regression analyses were performed on brain function during mentalizing (‘ToM N Control’), with CTQ total score as regressor of interest, and age, sex, diagnosis (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), behavioural performance (ToM accuracy and reaction time), PANSS total score, medication (imipramine and chlorpromazine equivalent dosages for antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, respectively, and mood stabilizer use) and IQ levels as covariates of no-interest. First, a family-wise error correction within an unique mask (small volume correction [p(SVC-FWE) = 0.05]) made of large functional regions-of-interest (ROIs; 545–692 voxels) generated for the bilateral TPJ, dmPFC and PCC/precuneus [see (Mohnke et al., 2016) for details] was applied to an initial voxel-level threshold of p b 0.001 (uncorrected). Brieﬂy, the ROIs were created literaturebased on coordinates reported by van Overwalle's meta-analysis (Van Overwalle, 2009) using the TWURoi toolbox (Schubert et al., 2008). Second, to identify ToM-related brain function associated with trauma exposure in regions located outside these ROIs, a cluster-level familywise error (FWE)-correction [p(FWEc) b 0.05] was applied to an initial voxel-level threshold of p b 0.001 (uncorrected), masked-out for the ROIs mask. Finally, potential associations between childhood trauma exposure (CTQ total score) and behavioural performance (ToM accuracy and reaction-time) and IQ levels – as previously found associated with ToM in schizophrenia (Bora et al., 2009) and following childhood trauma exposure (Hart and Rubia, 2012) – were evaluated using additional Pearson's correlation.  3. Results  Sociodemographic, clinical and behavioural data are presented in Table 3. For the full sample, the ToM task engendered signiﬁcant activation of the bilateral dmPFC, dlPFC, vlPFC, TPJ, ACC, PCC, STS and  Y.

The SVC analysis indicated a signiﬁcant positive association between CTQ total scores and activation within the PCC/precuneus [R2 = 0.156; peak MNI coordinates (6,−54,30), k = 165, t35 = 4.86, z = 4.22, p(SVC-FWE) = 0.031] (see Fig. 2). The exploratory whole-brain analysis (excluding voxels from the ROIs), indicated a signiﬁcant positive association between CTQ total score and BOLD signal (R2 = 0.107) in a cluster including the right medial superior frontal gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus and the supplementary motor area [dmPFC; peak MNI coordinates (14,16,50), k = 140, t35 = 4.33, z = 3.84, p(FWEc) = 0.038] that was located posterior to the dmPFC ROI. In addition, a signiﬁcant negative association between BOLD signal and CTQ total score (R2 = 0.380) was revealed in a cluster encompassing the right Rolandic Operculum, superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and posterior insula [TPJ; peak MNI coordinates (54,-28,20), k = 154, t35 = 4.11, z = 3.69, p(FWEc) = 0.026]; this cluster was located anterior to the right TPJ ROI. Changes in BOLD signal in these regions were not associated with any of the other covariates.  Additional Pearson correlation revealed no signiﬁcant associations between CTQ total score and task performance (ToM accuracy: r = −0.013, p = 0.930; ToM reaction-time: r = −0.176, p = 0.238) or IQ levels (r = 0.014, p = 0.926).  4. Discussion  This is the ﬁrst study to investigate the long-term effects of childhood trauma exposure on social brain function in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder during the performance of a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) task. Results indicate that greater levels of childhood trauma exposure are associated with increased activation of the PCC/precuneus and dmPFC, and reduced activation of the right TPJ, regardless of diagnosis.

Effective ToM is critically dependent on the integrity of key brain regions including the PCC/precuneus, dmPFC and TPJ (Abu-Akel and Shamay-Tsoory, 2011). Consistent with our hypothesis, ToM-related activation of both the PCC/precuneus and the dmPFC were positively associated with childhood trauma exposure independently of any effect of trauma on task performance. During ToM, the PCC/precuneus is implicated in processing self-related information (Abu-Akel and Shamay-Tsoory, 2011; Spreng and Grady, 2010; Spreng et al., 2009), as well as in contributing to mental state understanding using mental imagery skills (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Schurz et al., 2014), while the dmPFC is involved in processing social and/or emotional content about others (Saxe and Powell, 2006). Whereas the dmPFC cluster reported here was posterior to the dmPFC ROI from a meta-analysis of brain regions involved in social cognition (Van Overwalle, 2009), it overlapped with the dmPFC/supplementary motor area (cluster 2; ROI#3) ROI from a more recent meta-analysis (Schurz et al., 2014), which suggests this region is involved in trait judgements, especially about unfamiliar others (Schurz et al., 2014; Van Overwalle, 2009). Unexpectedly, trauma exposure was associated with decreased activation in the TPJ, a region representing the nexus between mental inference and salience detection (Carter et al., 2012) in order to establish a social context (Carter and Huettel, 2013). The interpretation of these ﬁndings should also consider that the TPJ cluster identiﬁed in the present study is anterior to the TPJ ROI in van Overwalle's meta-analysis (Van Overwalle, 2009), but overlaps with the anterior TPJ (TPJa; ROI#7) ROI from the Schurz et al. meta-analysis (Schurz et al., 2014), of which the latter is associated with social animation and rational action to understand human action or behaviour (Mars et al., 2012; Schurz et al., 2014). Together, these results indicate that trauma-exposure may, at least partially, account for the development of functional brain alterations contributing to abnormally self-oriented mental imagery (through increased PCC/precuneus activation), misrepresentation of others intentions (through increased dmPFC activation), and/or misunderstanding of the social context of an action/behaviour (through decreased TPJa activation) during ToM. These trauma-related functional brain alterations may thus contribute to abnormal mental state inference in individuals who later develop schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Interestingly, the TPJ, PCC and mPFC have been recently implicated as part of an extended default-mode network (eDMN), engaged in perspectivetaking and empathizing when social-emotional stimuli, in particular negative emotions, are displayed (Gottlich et al., 2017). Future use of a network analysis will be required to conﬁrm this interpretation, since trauma exposure is likely to impact an extended network of brain regions that includes, but is not limited to, ToM regions (Teicher et al., 2014; Teicher et al., 2016).  The present ﬁndings should be considered in light of the following limitations. Given the adult age of this sample, and the use of retrospective reports of childhood trauma, it remains unclear as to whether these functional brain alterations began to form during early child development, potentially underlying deﬁcits in social and emotional functioning that are antecedent to schizophrenia; longitudinal studies are required to clarify the extent to which childhood trauma can be regarded as a primary cause of these brain disturbances. In addition, we were unable to identify the effects of domain-speciﬁc trauma without contamination from other domains due to the strong correlations between each other. This was, however, not the case for sexual abuse, but as only 5 cases reported signiﬁcant exposure to sexual abuse uniquely (see Table 2), we did not investigate the speciﬁc effects of this traumatic domain on ToM brain function. Other limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size, the high levels of medication among schizophrenia participants; although the dosage equivalents of the major classes were accounted for in focal analyses. Although we attempted to account for diagnosis in the analyses, we acknowledge that the inclusion of cases with schizoaffective disorder may have inﬂuenced the patterns of affective processing and/or symptoms within the sample. Finally, the ToM imaging paradigm used in this  166  Y. Quidé et al. / Schizophrenia Research 189 (2017) 162–168  Fig. 1. Main effect of task (‘ToM N Control’) within the schizophrenia sample.

This may, at least in part, explain the lack of association between behavioural variables and trauma exposure.  In conclusion, we show here that signiﬁcant trauma experienced in childhood is associated with functional variations in key brain regions for effective ToM (TPJ, PCC, dmPFC) in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Future studies of effective connectivity within ToM networks using graph theory or dynamic causal modelling, in longitudinal studies beginning in childhood, would assist in understanding the impact of childhood trauma on the functional circuitry associated with social cognition dysfunction in schizophrenia.

However, it is not clear how the brain actually creates nonliteral language. Therefore, the present study for the ﬁrst time investigates the neural correlates of metaphor production. Participants completed sentences by generating novel metaphors or literal synonyms during functional imaging. Responses were spoken aloud in the scanner, recorded, and subsequently rated for their creative quality. We found that metaphor production was associated with focal activity in predominantly left-hemispheric brain regions, speciﬁcally the left angular gyrus, the left middle and superior frontal gyri—corresponding to the left dorsomedial prefrontal (DMPFC) cortex—and the posterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, brain activation in the left anterior DMPFC and the right middle temporal gyrus was found to linearly increase with the creative quality of metaphor responses. These ﬁndings are related to neuroscientiﬁc evidence on metaphor comprehension, creative idea generation and episodic future thought, suggesting that creating metaphors involves the ﬂexible adaptation of semantic memory to imagine and construct novel ﬁgures of speech. Furthermore, the left DMPFC may exert executive control to maintain strategic search and selection, thus facilitating creativity of thought. © 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Such nonliteral expressions are widely used to express symbolism in the arts (Kennedy, 2008) and convey imagery in everyday conversations (Carter, 2004). Psycholinguistic (Gibbs, 1994; Kintsch, 2000; Lackoff and Johnson, 1980) and neuroscientiﬁc (Mashal et al., 2007; Rapp et al., 2004) research has thoroughly investigated the cognitive processes and neural correlates of metaphor comprehension. Yet little is known about how new metaphors are produced. Recent behavioral research has begun to shed light on the cognitive abilities underlying metaphor production (Beaty and Silvia, 2013; Chiappe and Chiappe, 2007; Silvia and Beaty, 2012), and suggests an important role of controlled attention and strategic semantic search processes. Nevertheless, an investigation of how the brain produces new metaphors remains elusive. In the present study, we explored this question by taking a ﬁrst look at the neural correlates of ﬁgurative language production.  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Psychology, University of Graz,  Maiffredygasse 12b, 8010 Graz, Austria.

Metaphor comprehension involves forming an abstract connection between two concepts in semantic memory. Such a link, or attributive category, is established by extracting and relating similar properties of different concepts in memory (Glucksberg, 2001, 2003). For example, the metaphor music is medicine involves identifying the conceptual category “something that is healing”, abstracting the properties of music and medicine that are related, and inhibiting the properties that are unrelated. This model has also been used to conceptualize metaphor production. Recently, Beaty and Silvia (2013) examined the cognitive processes involved in producing conventional (i.e., familiar) and creative (i.e., novel) metaphors. The ability to produce creative metaphors was more strongly associated with ﬂuid intelligence and verbal ﬂuency, pointing to the involvement of executive functions; in contrast, the ability to produce conventional metaphors was associated with general vocabulary knowledge. The processes involved in verbal ﬂuency tasks mirror some of the theoretical functions of metaphor comprehension; for example, verbal ﬂuency requires the generation and maintenance of a semantic cue (e.g., searching memory for synonyms for “good”), which closely resemble the demands of an attributive category (searching memory for “something that is healing”). Taken together, metaphor comprehension and production thus seem to involve some of the same underlying cognitive processes.  Neuroscientiﬁc research on metaphor has, so far, largely focused on metaphor comprehension. Such studies typically contrast brain  1053-8119 © 2013 The Authors.

Benedek et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 99–106  activation during passive processing of literal with nonliteral statements (e.g., Rapp et al., 2004). Recently, a number of meta-analyses have tried to summarize ﬁndings across fMRI studies on ﬁgurative language processing (Bohrn et al., 2012; Rapp et al., 2012; Vartanian, 2012; Yang, 2012). These meta-analyses report consistent patterns of activation in frontal, temporal and parietal regions located predominately in the left hemisphere. The processing of nonliteral sentences was commonly related to activations in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left middle and superior temporal gyri (MTG and STG), and left inferior parietal cortex (IPC), and parahippocampal gyri.  These brain regions are believed to play discriminable roles for the comprehension of nonliteral language. Metaphors are usually not correct in a literal sense and thus can only be understood when the nonliteral meaning is extracted. Traditional views on metaphor processing assume that the literal meaning has to be processed and discarded in the ﬁrst place, paving the way for a subsequent recognition of the nonliteral meaning (e.g., Clark and Lucy, 1975). According to the “parallel hypothesis” both meanings are processed concurrently (McElree and Nordlie, 1999). In this context, the left IFG (BA45/47) is thought to be relevant for the selection of the appropriate meaning and the suppression of inappropriate or irrelevant meanings (Badre and Wagner, 2007; Glucksberg et al., 2001; Rapp et al., 2012). Metaphor processing was also consistently related to activations in the left MTG and STG. The MTG and STG are at the core of a richly interconnected language network reaching to frontal and parietal structures and thus are conceived to play a general role in language comprehension (Turken and Dronkers, 2011) that may be especially taxed during the probably more complex processing of ﬁgurative language. Finally, the left IPC, and more speciﬁcally the left angular gyrus (AG), are thought to play an important role for metaphor processing through its function to integrate individual conceptual representations into a coherent meaning (e.g., Bambini et al., 2011; Binder et al., 2009).  While language processing is traditionally known to be dominant in the left hemisphere, a number of studies examining ﬁgurative language processing deﬁcits in patients with unilateral brain damage suggested an important role of the right hemisphere for comprehending ﬁgurative language (Schmidt et al., 2010; Thoma and Daum, 2006). In this context, it was suggested that the speciﬁc neuroanatomic structure of righthemispheric language areas results in a coarser semantic coding of information that may facilitate coactivation between remote semantic concepts (Jung-Beeman, 2005). Findings from fMRI studies, however, have been inconsistent (e.g., Rapp et al., 2007) and meta-analytic evidence does not support a strong speciﬁc role of the right hemisphere in metaphor processing (Bohrn et al., 2012; Rapp et al., 2012).  A more consistent involvement of the right hemisphere has been observed in studies comparing the processing of novel versus conventional metaphors (Mashal et al., 2009; Rutter et al., 2012; Subramaniam et al., 2012). Unfamiliar metaphoric expressions appear to recruit different frontal brain regions, including the bilateral IFG and left middle frontal gyrus, as well as temporal regions of the right hemisphere (Bambini et al., 2011; Mashal et al., 2008, 2009; Rutter et al., 2012; Yang, 2012). This is in line with the “graded salience hypothesis” (Giora, 1997), which assumes that the right hemisphere is particularly involved in the processing of novel, non-salient ﬁgurative language. In contrast, in familiar metaphors, the metaphoric meaning is salient and hence does not depend as much on right hemispheric processing.  Metaphor and creative idea generation  The study of metaphor production offers a new approach to the longstanding problem of how people come up with new ideas. Previous neuroimaging studies have used a range of approaches to investigate the brain regions involved in different types of creative cognition, such as insight problem solving, creative idea generation (i.e., divergent thinking), story generation, and visual problem solving (e.g., AzizZadeh et al., 2012; Bowden et al., 2005; Fink et al., 2009; Goel and  Vartanian, 2005; Howard-Jones et al., 2005; for reviews, see Arden et al., 2010; Dietrich and Kanso, 2010; Fink and Benedek, in press). Studies focusing on divergent thinking usually ask participants to generate novel responses to open-ended problems. For example, Fink et al. (2009) compared performance on tasks with greater creative demands (i.e., generating novel uses for objects) with tasks involving lower creative demands (i.e., generating typical characteristics of objects). Generating novel ideas was associated with increased activation in the left angular gyrus and decreased activation in the right temporoparietal junction (see also Abraham et al., 2012).  Furthermore, Benedek et al. (2013) assessed the novelty of verbal responses to an alternate uses task during functional imaging. Generating novel uses—responses participants identiﬁed as unfamiliar to them prior to scanning—was related to stronger activation in the left inferior parietal cortex as compared to generating previously known uses—responses participants had retrieved from memory. The left inferior parietal cortex plays an important role in semantic integration (Binder et al., 2009) and mental simulation (Hassabis and Maguire, 2007). This region is thought to contribute to the brain's ability to ﬂexibly recombine stored information in memory into novel mental representations (e.g., episodic future thinking; Cabeza et al., 2008; Schacter et al., 2007, 2012). Finally, there is evidence that the generation of more creative ideas is related to activation of left prefrontal brain regions (Benedek et al., 2013; Fink et al., 2012), possibly subserving executive processes needed to inhibit dominant response tendencies. Taken together, several related literature provide converging evidence on how the brain integrates knowledge to produce novel ideas; however, the extent to which such processes contribute to the production of ﬁgurative language remains unknown.  The present research  The present study used fMRI to examine the neural correlates of ﬁgurative language production. We presented participants with brief phrases relating objects to characteristics (e.g., the lamp is [glaring]), and asked them to complete the phrases with metaphors or literal expressions. Responses were spoken aloud in the scanner, recorded, and later coded for accuracy and creative quality. The present research had two goals: (1) to provide a ﬁrst look at the neural correlates of metaphor production, and (2) to determine what brain regions are related to the creativity of responses. Based on the available evidence on metaphor processing and creative idea generation, metaphor generation should be associated with focal activity in the left hemisphere, especially the left inferior parietal cortex (IPC). Moreover, based on the evidence on metaphor novelty and creativity, we expected the creative quality of metaphor responses to be associated with activation in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and potentially with an additional recruitment of the right hemisphere.  Material and methods  Participants  The original sample consisted of 32 adults. Four participants were excluded, two for excessive head movements (N1.5 mm without online motion correction), one for noncompliance, and one for aborting the scanner session early. After exclusions, the ﬁnal sample consisted of 28 healthy adults (18 females; mean age: 26.2 years, age range: 19–49). The participants were drawn from a larger pool recruited via newspaper advertisement. All participants were right-handed native-German speakers, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no reported history of CNS-affecting drugs or neurological disease. Participants gave written informed consent and were paid for participation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee.  M. Benedek et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 99–106  101  Experimental task and procedure  Imaging procedure  Participants worked on a metaphor production task and a control task that required production of literal responses (i.e., synonyms). Both tasks presented short phrases relating a noun to an adjective in parentheses, e.g., “The lamp is (glaring)”. In the metaphor production task, participants were asked to produce a creative (i.e., novel and appropriate) metaphor that conveys the meaning of the adjective, and thus may replace it in the phrase (e.g., “a supernova”). In the literal control task, participants were asked to produce a synonym that conveys the meaning of the adjective as closely as possible, and thus may replace it in the phrase (e.g., “bright”).  The sentences were presented in white letters at the middle of a black screen. In both tasks, participants had 10 s to think of a response. If they produced a response in less than 10 s, they were encouraged to come up with an even more creative metaphor, or a more adequate synonym, respectively. After 10 s, the stimulus turned green for 5 s, indicating that participants should now vocalize their response (see Fig. 1). The temporal separation of idea generation and response periods is commonly employed in neuroscientiﬁc studies on creative idea generation to avoid artifacts related to overt responses (Fink and Benedek, in press). Participants were told to respond only with the new continuation of the sentence, not to repeat the entire sentence (e.g., “a supernova,” not “The lamp is a supernova.”). If they were unable to come up with a response, they were asked to respond with “don't know”. The responses were recorded by means of an MRI-compatible microphone and transcribed for further analyses.  Participants performed a total of 48 trials using 48 different stimulus phrases (see Appendix). Some of the phrases were adapted from previous behavioral studies on metaphor production (Beaty and Silvia, 2013; Chiappe and Chiappe, 2007) and others were devised by the authors. For each participant, half of the phrases were randomly assigned to either task (i.e., metaphor and literal). To maximize the power of the task contrast, trials were grouped to eight task blocks (four metaphors, four synonyms) in an ABBAABBA/BAABBAAB fashion, with each block containing six trials of one task.  Fig. 1 depicts the experimental paradigm. A block started with a ﬁxation period (5 s), followed by a cue (5 s) indicating the task to be performed in that block (metaphor or synonym). After the cue, six trials were presented separated in time by jittered (3–7 s) ﬁxation null periods. Additional 10-s ﬁxation periods were presented at the beginning and end of the session.  Before the scanner session, participants received thorough task instructions explaining the difference between metaphoric and literal responses followed by eight exercise trials. Participants then performed the tasks in a single fMRI run, a T1-scan, and another unrelated task. After the scanner session, participants rated the difﬁculty of the metaphor and synonym task on a 5-point rating scale from 1 (very easy) to 5 (very difﬁcult).  Whole brain imaging was performed on a 3T Siemens Skyra MRI system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) using a 32channel head coil. BOLD-sensitive T2*-weighted functional images were acquired using a single shot gradient-echo EPI pulse sequence (TR = 2400 ms, TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, 35 axial slices, 3.5 × 3.5 × 3.5 mm, distance factor 20%, FoV = 240 × 240 mm, interleaved slice ordering) and corrected online for head motion. The ﬁrst two volumes were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Head motion was restricted using ﬁrm padding that surrounded the head. Visual stimuli were presented using the software Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA) onto a screen and viewed through a mirror attached to the head coil. Verbal responses were recorded by means of a MRI-compatible noise canceling microphone (FOMRI-III; Optoacoustics, Mazor, Israel) also attached to the head coil.  Analysis of response behavior  All responses were transcribed to a spreadsheet and pooled for each item and task across participants, resulting in 48 item-speciﬁc response lists for both tasks. Responses were examined for validity by two raters who attained consensual agreement on the accuracy of responses. The raters marked responses as invalid when participants responded “don't know” or when they gave a literal response in the metaphor task, or vice versa.  Metaphor responses were also scored for creative quality using the subjective scoring method (Benedek et al., 2013; Christensen et al., 1957; Silvia et al., 2008). Three raters scored responses independently using a three-point scale (1 = not at all creative, 3 = very creative). The raters were trained to score responses based on criteria of remoteness, novelty, and cleverness (Christensen et al., 1957). Remoteness reﬂected the conceptual distance of the response from the topic; novelty reﬂected originality; and cleverness reﬂected whether a response was witty, funny, or interesting. The three criteria were factored into a single, holistic score and applied to each response (Beaty and Silvia, 2013; Silvia and Beaty, 2012).  Functional imaging analysis  Functional MRI data analysis was performed using SPM 8 software (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK). For each participant, approximately 450 functional images were obtained. Preprocessing steps included slice time acquisition correction, motion correction, spatial normalization to an averaged EPI template in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and smoothing with a 10-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel.  Effects were estimated with a subject-speciﬁc ﬁxed effects model including the conditions CUE (i.e., task cue), METAPHOR (i.e., generating  Fig. 1. Schematic sequence of ﬁrst trial within a task block. After an initial ﬁxation period a cue indicated whether participants should generate metaphors or synonyms (literal control task) in this block. In each trial, participants had 10 s to complete the sentence by generating a metaphor, or a synonym. Responses were given in the subsequent response period (5 s) indicated by the stimulus word changing its color to green. Trials were separated by jittered ﬁxation periods.  102  M. Benedek et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 99–106  metaphor responses), LITERAL (i.e., generating synonym responses), and SPEECH (i.e., vocalization of responses). Generation periods (metaphor or literal) that did not result in valid responses were modeled as separate regressors of no interest, as were motion parameters. Linear contrasts were used to obtain subject-speciﬁc estimates for each effect. These estimates were entered into a second-level analysis treating subjects as a random effect with a one-sample t-test against a contrast value of zero at each voxel.  The brain activation speciﬁc for metaphor production was examined with the contrast of METAPHOR N LITERAL and LITERAL N METAPHOR, respectively. Moreover, we performed a parametric analysis to examine the brain regions sensitive to the creativity of metaphor responses. To this end, we added a regressor to the ﬁrst-level model coding the average creativity rating (averaged across raters) of each valid metaphor response. Voxel-based results are reported when they are signiﬁcant at a level of p b .05, corrected for multiple comparisons by means of family-wise error (FWE) correction. Finally, the direction (activation or deactivation) and amplitude of the signal change over time was explored for all signiﬁcant task effects using MarsBaR 0.43 (Brett et al., 2002).  Results  Behavioral results  On average, participants were able to produce valid responses in 87% of metaphor trials and 90% of the literal control trials, thus showing no signiﬁcant performance differences between tasks, t(27) = 1.50, p = .15. Moreover, self-reported task difﬁculty did not differ between tasks (mean difﬁculty rating: 2.18, and 1.96 for metaphor and literal, respectively; t(27) = 1.24, p = .23). The metaphor creativity scores from the three raters were averaged to form a composite for analysis (mean rating = 1.63, SD = 0.15).  Neural correlates of metaphor production  The whole-brain contrast of the tasks (METAPHOR N LITERAL; p b .05, FWE corrected, k N 20) revealed that metaphor production was associated with stronger brain activation than the control condition in seven clusters (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). The strongest effect was observed in the left inferior parietal cortex, peaking in the left angular gyrus (AG) and extending to posterior parts of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and adjacent occipital regions. Signal change analyses showed that activation in the left AG increased during metaphor production but decreased during the literal control task (see Fig. 2).  Metaphor production was also related to stronger activation in a left-hemispheric cluster comprising the dorsal–medial middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and dorsal superior frontal gyrus (SFG) which has been labeled dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC; cf. Binder et al., 2009). To analyze signal change in the left DMPFC separately for the MFG and the SFG subregions, we generated ROIs at their local peaks (see Table 1) with a sphere of 5 mm. In the left MFG, brain activation strongly increased from the beginning during both tasks; however, this activation was stronger during metaphor production than during the control task. In the SFG, a signiﬁcant activation increase was only observed during metaphor production and especially towards the end of the task. Metaphor production was also related to signiﬁcantly stronger bilateral activation of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the adjacent ventral precuneus. Finally, metaphor production was related to stronger activations in bilateral parahippocampal and fusiform gyri, as well as in the left lingual gyrus and the right posterior cerebellum. The reversed contrast (LITERAL N METAPHOR) did not reveal further signiﬁcant effects.  Neural correlates of metaphor creativity  A parametric analysis was used to analyze the brain activation related to the creative quality of metaphor responses (p b .05, FWE corrected). This analysis revealed that brain activity linearly increased with creativity ratings in the central dorsomedial part of the left SFG, corresponding to the anterior DMPFC (peak coordinates x, y, z = − 15, 42, 52; k = 3, Tmax = 6.28), as well as in the right anterior middle temporal gyrus (MTG; peak coordinates x, y, z = 48, 0, −22; k = 8, Tmax = 5.88). Notably, the activation cluster in the DMPFC overlapped with the signiﬁcant DMPFC cluster from the task contrast (METAPHOR N LITERAL). Metaphor creativity was not associated with any signiﬁcant decreases in brain activation.  Task-general effects  For reasons of comparison with other studies of idea generation, we also report the task-general activation pattern related to both tasks (metaphor production and synonym production; METAPHOR & LITERAL N 0; p b .05, FWE corrected). The tasks were associated with brain activation in extended brain areas, most prominently in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), bilaterally in the insula, the precentral gyrus, the lingual gyrus, and the posterior cerebellum, and with deactivations (METAPHOR & LITERAL b 0) in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and, to a weaker extent, in the left inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and the anterior cingulate (AC).  Discussion  The present study investigated the neural correlates of metaphor generation. Participants generated novel metaphors or literal responses in the scanner, and functional imaging was used to explore the brain regions unique to producing metaphors. We found that metaphor production was associated with increased activation in predominantly left-hemispheric brain regions, speciﬁcally the left angular gyrus (AG), the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Moreover, brain activation in the left DMPFC and the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) increased as a function of the creative quality of responses. These results are discussed in the context of the literatures on metaphor processing and creative cognition.  Neural correlates of metaphor production  As expected, metaphor production was related to a left-lateralized activation pattern, including activation of the left AG. The left AG is part of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and has been consistently implicated in metaphor processing (Rapp et al., 2012) as well as creative idea generation (Fink et al., 2009). In a recent meta-analysis of 120 imaging studies, the left AG was identiﬁed as the most consistently activated region during tasks involving semantic processing (Binder et al., 2009). Due to its involvement in a variety of semantic processes, the left AG has been conceived as a supramodal association area, one that plays a key role in strategic knowledge retrieval and complex information integration. Further overlap with regions involved in metaphor processing was observed in the parahippocampal gyri. The parahippocampal gyri are considered part of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a system that is essential for declarative memory (Squire et al., 2004). Together, these regions appear to be relevant for nonliteral language processing in general—both comprehension and production—by activating and relating shared semantic information between remotely associated concepts.  Meta-analyses on metaphor processing also consistently report brain activation in left IFG and left MTG (e.g., Bohrn et al., 2012; Rapp et al., 2012; Vartanian, 2012; Yang, 2012). Although these brain regions were found to be activated during both metaphoric and literal response  M. Benedek et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 99–106  103  Fig. 2.

Signiﬁcant activation clusters (p b .05, FWE corrected, k N 20) are shown at different axial slices (z = −15, −5, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55). Additional, signal change is plotted over time (TR 1 to TR 6 after onset of idea generation period, corresponding to 2.4 to 14.4 s, respectively) for signiﬁcant activation clusters.

The left IFG is conceived to be relevant for the evaluation and selection of meaning (Badre and Wagner, 2007; Turken and Dronkers, 2011). A central difference between metaphor comprehension and metaphor production tasks is that the former requires the extraction of the relevant semantic property conveyed by the metaphor, whereas in the latter, the relevant semantic feature is explicitly cued, and it requires ﬁnding a metaphor that serves as a vehicle for it. Therefore, since metaphor production does not primarily require the extraction of meaning behind a given metaphor but rather its generation, this may provide one explanation for the absence of activation differences in the left IFG.  While our results suggest that metaphor comprehension and production share some common neural substrates, we found several brain regions that appear to be unique to production. The most notable regions include the left DMPFC, the PCC, and the left lingual gyrus. The DMPFC encompasses the dorsal SFG extending to the posterior-medial part of the left MFG, roughly corresponding to BA 8 (Binder et al., 2009). Lesion studies have shown that damage to this region causes transcortical motor aphasia (Alexander and Benson, 1993; Freedman et al., 1984). Patients suffering from this condition can normally repeat words and name objects, but they are unable to generate responses from a larger set of possibilities (Robinson et al., 1998). Therefore, it was suggested that the DMPFC is speciﬁcally relevant for  104  M. Benedek et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 99–106  Table 1 Whole-brain task effects (METAPHOR vs. LITERAL).

This observation may provide a key insight into the nature of ﬁgurative language production. In this study, the DMPFC showed increased activation in both the main contrast of interest (i.e., METAPHOR N LITERAL) and as a function of response quality (i.e., creativity ratings). The metaphor production task was open-ended, and thus the range of possible responses was large. The range of responses to a given prompt appeared to be limited solely by the verbal ability and creative potential of the participants, which is a central characteristic of creative idea generation tasks. The DMPFC may therefore play an important role in the generation—or response invention (cf., Binder et al., 2009)—of new and meaningful ﬁgurative language, by supporting the effective goalmaintenance required for controlled semantic retrieval and the selection (and inhibition) of responses from a larger set of possibilities. We also found that metaphor production was related to stronger activation in the left PCC. The PCC has been implicated in episodic memory retrieval (e.g., Vincent et al., 2006) and visuospatial mental imagery (e.g., Hassabis and Maguire, 2007). It is also worth noting that the AG showed the strongest effect in this study but only a minor effect in a recent meta-analysis on metaphor processing (Rapp et al., 2012). This suggests that the left AG could be even more relevant for metaphor production than for metaphor comprehension. The PCC and the left AG have both been conceived as central components of the semantic memory system (Binder et al., 2009). On the other hand, these regions have also been tied to the brain's default mode network (e.g., Raichle et al., 2001; see also, Seghier et al., 2010). It was proposed that taskunrelated and self-directed thoughts—trademarks of default mode activity—are essentially semantic cognitions because they involve the activation and manipulation of acquired knowledge (Binder et al., 2009). Furthermore, the activation of default mode network regions are also observed during forms of mental simulation involving spatial navigation or taking the perspective of others (Buckner and Carroll, 2007). Recent research on episodic memory has shown that the PCC and the lateral parietal cortex—together with medial–frontal and temporal regions—show comparable activation when participants are asked to recall an event from their past or imagine an event in the future (Addis et al., 2007; Schacter et al., 2007, 2012; Szpunar, 2010). These ﬁndings helped to inform the constructive hypothesis of episodic memory (cf., Hassabis and Maguire, 2007; Schacter et al., 2007), and led to the notion that retrieving information from past experiences is essential for constructing novel representations of the future. Similarly, theories of creative cognition are grounded in the assumption that novel ideas result from the recombination of relevant memory elements (Koestler, 1964; Mednick, 1962). When conceiving metaphor generation as a creative idea generation task (Beaty and Silvia, 2013; Silvia and Beaty, 2012), it becomes obvious that this task relies on the retrieval of  acquired knowledge from memory which needs to be integrated to form a novel ﬁgures of speech.  Similar reasoning has been applied in another recent study on the neural basis of creative idea generation (Benedek et al., 2013). This study found that creating novel uses for objects elicited strong activation in the left inferior parietal cortex—a region tied to mental simulation and “mental time travel” (e.g., Nyberg et al., 2010; Schacter et al., 2007). Moreover, activation of the left AG was also found to be stronger during divergent thinking tasks that involve higher creative task demands (Fink et al., 2009). Taken together, metaphor production and mental simulation may both rely on common generative processes, drawing on stored knowledge to imagine and construct novel mental representations.  Neural correlates of metaphor creativity  Our analysis took a ﬁne-grained approach to examining the role of novelty in metaphor production. We examined brain activation related to creative quality at the level of single ideas. Parametric analyses showed that activation linearly increased with creative quality in the left anterior DMPFC (dorsomedial part of SFG) and the right MTG. The cluster in the DMPFC overlaps with the DMPFC cluster observed the general task contrast (METAPHOR N LITERAL), suggesting that activity in this area is associated with creativity-related demands at both task and idea levels. The parametric effect in the left DMPFC supports our hypothesis that creativity of metaphors should be associated with activation of the left prefrontal cortex (PFC). Similarly, Fink et al. (2012) found greater activation in the same SFG region within the DMPFC after stimulating creativity by confronting people with common ideas generated by other people. In yet another related study, cognitive stimulation during creative idea generation also led to higher relative brain activation in the left medial superior frontal gyrus (Fink et al., 2010). Finally, Benedek et al. (2013) observed parametric effects of idea creativity in the alternate uses task located in the orbital part of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Taken together, converging evidence suggests that the left PFC might play a key role for the creativity aspect of novel ideas. The present study may also be seen to provide parallels to behavioral studies of creative cognition. For example, the ability to generate creative ideas has been linked to higher-order cognitive abilities such as ﬂuid intelligence (Beaty and Silvia, 2013; Jauk et al., 2013, in press), and executive processes such as pre-potent response inhibition (Benedek et al., 2012a). Such abilities are thought to play a key role in providing top-down control of attention and cognition during creative idea generation, by maintaining the task goal, exerting cognitive inhibition, and deploying strategic semantic search processes (Beaty and Silvia, 2012; Benedek and Neubauer, 2013; Benedek et al., 2012b; Gilhooly et al., 2007; Nusbaum and Silvia, 2011). The DMPFC has previously been implicated in goal-maintenance and uncued semantic retrieval during tasks that involve the ﬂexible, non-formulaic use of language (Binder et al., 2009). Activation of the DMPFC during metaphor generation could thus reﬂect executive mechanisms needed to inhibit dominant responses or meanings (e.g., inhibiting literal in favor of nonliteral interpretations; Glucksberg et al., 2001; Thoma and Daum, 2006) and maintain the semantic search process en route to an original ﬁgurative response. Interestingly, signal change analysis indicated that activation in the anterior DMPFC increased only at the very end of the task. This delayed effect may correspond to an inﬂuence of executive processes at a later stage in the production process, whereby a larger number of competing responses are inhibited once a more adequate response is found. Alternatively, the DMPFC may also play an evaluative role, such as determining whether an idea ﬁts the goal of the task (i.e., discernment; Silvia, 2008). Future research should further examine the DMPFC's role in creative thought.  The creative quality of metaphors was also related to greater activation of the right anterior MTG. Several studies reported that the right hemisphere plays a role for the processing of novel metaphors or non M. Benedek et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 99–106  105  salient meaning in language (e.g., Bambini et al., 2011; Bottini et al., 1994; Giora et al., 2000; Mashal et al., 2008; Pobric et al., 2008; Rapp et al., 2012; Yang, 2012). This ﬁnding is in line with the hypothesis that the generation of novel, creative metaphors may likewise lead to an additional recruitment of right-hemisphere regions. Speciﬁcally, it was proposed that right hemisphere regions are involved in coarse semantic processing (Jung-Beeman, 2005) and related to processing of non-salient semantic meanings as stated by the graded salience hypothesis (Giora, 1997).  The process of idea generation  The generation of metaphors and synonyms can be generally considered as divergent thinking tasks (i.e., idea generation tasks), since these tasks have various possible solutions that differ in quality (Guilford, 1967). The present results replicated the ﬁnding that divergent thinking is generally associated with strong activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and with deactivation in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ; Abraham et al., 2012; Benedek et al., 2013; Fink et al., 2009). The IFG is known to be involved in general semantic processing and has been especially associated with verbal ﬂuency (Binder et al., 2009; Costafreda et al., 2006). The sustained deactivation of the right TPJ is thought to indicate focused attention which helps to prevent reorienting to distracting bottom-up stimuli during divergent thought (Berkowitz and Ansari, 2010; Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Corbetta et al., 2008). This is in line with consistent reports of increased EEG alpha activity (i.e., alpha synchronization) over the right parietal cortex during different types of divergent thinking tasks (Benedek et al., 2011; Fink and Benedek, 2013, in press).  Strengths, limitations, and future directions  The present study was strengthened by our ability to capture verbal responses in the scanner. This allowed us to monitor the accuracy of task performance, a methodological approach not possible in studies employing silent response generation. Moreover, recording verbal responses enabled a unique look at the creative quality of each idea, and a further examination of how quality related to brain activation. Our design was somewhat limited, however, by allowing only very brief periods of time for responses to be developed. Past research has found a strong correlation between time-on-task and creative quality of novel metaphors (Silvia and Beaty, 2012). The present design was constrained by the need to use a brief task that affords associating brain activity with well-deﬁned cognitive processes. Nevertheless, this did not seem to compromise the results, as we were still able to capture an adequate range of differences in task performance and isolate regions speciﬁc to metaphor quality.  Our study suggests interesting parallels between the neural correlates of metaphor production and comprehension, but the basis for making inferences regarding such processes is limited. It certainly would have been interesting to directly contrast metaphor production with comprehension in the scanner; however, this was complicated by the fact that the generation of metaphors usually takes substantially longer than comprehension of metaphors. Future research should attempt to equate metaphor production and comprehension tasks, to allow for a direct comparison within the same experimental paradigm. Finally, one might assume that generating metaphors is more difﬁcult than generating synonyms which might bias the contrast of these two tasks. However, pilot tests suggested that generating semantically accurate synonyms can also be quite difﬁcult. This was conﬁrmed by analyses of behavioral performance in the scanner showing that the tasks did neither differ in self-rated difﬁculty nor in the number of valid responses. We conclude that task difﬁculty does not have a major effect on our ﬁndings.  Conclusion  The present study examined the neural correlates of ﬁgurative language production. Our ﬁndings suggest that the generation of novel metaphors particularly relies on the left AG and the PCC, supporting the ﬂexible integration of knowledge for the construction of novel semantic representations. Furthermore, the left DMPFC, which was activated during both metaphor production and as a function of metaphor creativity, is assumed to exert executive control to facilitate strategic retrieval processes and inhibit dominant or literal concepts. Taken together, this study provides a ﬁrst investigation of the neural correlates of ﬁgurative language production, and points to an important role of left prefrontal and lateral parietal brain regions for the generation of new metaphors.

Here, we examined sex diﬀerences and neural bases of depression in chronic ketamine users. Compared to non-drug using healthy controls (HC), ketamine-using females but not males showed increased depression score as assessed by the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). We evaluated resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), a prefrontal structure consistently implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. Compared to HC, ketamine users (KU) did not demonstrate signiﬁcant changes in sgACC connectivities at a corrected threshold. However, in KU, a linear regression against CES-D score showed less sgACC connectivity to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with increasing depression severity. Examined separately, male and female KU showed higher sgACC connectivity to bilateral superior temporal gyrus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), respectively, in correlation with depression. The linear correlation of sgACC-OFC and sgACC-dmPFC connectivity with depression was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in slope between KU and HC. These ﬁndings highlighted changes in rsFC of the sgACC as associated with depression and sex diﬀerences in these changes in chronic ketamine users.  1. Introduction  First synthesized as a derivative of phencyclidine in 1960s, ketamine has been used as an anesthetic in medicine. Ketamine has powerful psychological eﬀects and recent studies including many clinical trials have focused on its potential as an antidepressant. On the other hand, ketamine elicits euphoria and dissociation ("out-of-body" experiences) and has increasingly become one of the major substances of abuse in many parts of the world, including Asia (Huang et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Sassano-Higgins et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2015). In animal studies, ketamine induces selfadministration and conditioned place preference (Botanas et al., 2015; De Luca and Badiani, 2011; Guo et al., 2016a; Suzuki et al., 1999; van der Kam et al., 2009; Venniro et al., 2015; Winger et al., 2002; Young and Woods, 1981). The potential of ketamine abuse may have to do  with its action on the dopaminergic systems (Hancock and Stamford, 1999; however, see Can et al., 2016). On the other hand, ketamine is an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, and the neural bases underlying ketamine addiction likely involve more than the dopaminergic circuits.  Drug abuse leads to cognitive and aﬀective dysfunction. Studies in humans have characterized deﬁcits in attention, working memory and executive functions and changes in emotion and aﬀective behavior in substance abusers. In particular, brain imaging has provided an important venue to investigate the neural bases of these cognitive and aﬀective deﬁcits (Li and Sinha, 2008). Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), which captures the organization of functional brain networks, has been widely used to unravel changes in circuit functions in various neuropsychiatric conditions including addiction. Numerous studies implicated the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC, or  ⁎ Correspondence to: Connecticut Mental Health Center S112, 34 Park Street, New Haven, CT 06519-1109, USA. ⁎⁎ Correspondence to: Department of Health Promotion and Health Education, National Taiwan Normal University, 162 Section One, He-Ping East Road, Taipei 10610, Taiwan.

Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 269 (2017) 1–8  Brodmann area 25) in depression on the bases of functional imaging, lesioning, and electromagnetic stimulation (see Berlim et al., 2014; Dunlop and Mayberg, 2014; Savitz and Drevets, 2009 for a review). For instance, compared to controls, adolescents with depression demonstrated elevated connectivity between the sgACC and insula as well as amygdala, and decreased connectivity between the sgACC and precuneus in association with the severity of depression (Connolly et al., 2013). Compared with controls, unmedicated young adults with remitted depression demonstrated hyperconnectivity of the left sgACC to the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and left hippocampus (Jacobs et al., 2016). Children at risk in developing major depression exhibited hyperconnectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and sgACC, and the magnitude of connectivity correlated positively with individual depression symptom scores (Chai et al., 2016). In a randomized sham-controlled trial, responders to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment of depression showed signiﬁcantly stronger anti-correlated rsFC between the sgACC and left superior medial prefrontal cortex at baseline (Baeken et al., 2014). Vasopressin, a modulator of mammalian social behavior reduces sgACC activity and its connectivity with the amygdala and other limbic regions implicated in emotional regulation (Zink et al., 2010). Together, these ﬁndings highlight sgACC connectivity as a neural marker of depression and response to depression treatment.  increased cortical/subcortical-hippocampal  Many studies examined the eﬀects of acute ketamine administration on rsFC in healthy volunteers and clinical populations (Abdallah et al., 2016; Li and Vlisides, 2016; Wong et al., 2016) as well as in non-human primates (Gopinath et al., 2016; Lv et al., 2016). In healthy humans, ketamine connectivity (Grimm et al., 2015; Khalili-Mahani et al., 2015) and thalamic connectivity with the somatosensory and temporal cortex (Hoﬂich et al., 2015). In contrast, ketamine decreased DMN connectivity with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Scheidegger et al., 2012), fronto-temporal functional connectivity (Kraguljac et al., 2016) and sgACC connectivity with the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, and thalamus (Wong et al., 2016). Increasing the depth of ketamine sedation suppressed anticorrelated activity between the DMN and other regions in healthy adults (Bonhomme et al., 2016). In rats the strongest ketamine eﬀects were dose- and exposure-dependent increases in functional connectivity within the prefrontal cortex and in connectivities between the posterior hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and prefrontal regions (Gass et al., 2014). Task-based imaging studies have also demonstrated the eﬀects of ketamine on regional responses in healthy participants (Kleinloog et al., 2015; Lehmann et al., 2016; Scheidegger et al., 2016; Steﬀens et al., 2016) and clinical populations (Becerra et al., 2015) in a variety of cognitive and aﬀective paradigms. These ﬁndings together characterized a wide range of acute eﬀects of ketamine on cerebral activity.  On the other hand, few studies have examined changes in cerebral structure, activation and connectivity in chronic ketamine users (Hoﬂich et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013), who frequently suﬀer comorbid depression (Chang et al., 2016). Women are  Table 1 Clinical characteristics of the participants.  more vulnerable than men to depression (Kessler, 2003). In a survey of over 1600 chronic ketamine users females presented signiﬁcantly more discontinuation symptoms such as anxiety, dysphoria, and tremors and reported more severe cognitive impairment compared with male users (Chen et al., 2014). Preclinical work also suggested sex diﬀerences in the behavioral eﬀects of ketamine. For instance, female SpragueDawley rats appeared to be more sensitive to ketamine-induced conditioned place preference than male rats (Guo et al., 2016b). In another study male and female rats were exposed to a single intraperitoneal injection of ketamine of varying dosages and tested 30 min later on forced swim and novelty suppressed feeding (Carrier and Kabbaj, 2013). Compared to male rats, female rats demonstrated greater sensitivity to the antidepressant eﬀects of ketamine, and the eﬀects were contingent on female sex hormones. In a recent study both male and female rats showed depression-like behavior after chronic social isolation as well as synaptic and postsynaptic changes in the medial prefrontal cortex. However, a single ketamine injection reversed these changes in male but not female rats (Sarkar and Kabbaj, 2016). Together, these studies suggest important sex diﬀerences in the depression-related behavioral eﬀects of ketamine.  Here, we combined clinical assessments and fMRI  to explore changes in rsFC of the sgACC in relation to depression in ketamine users. We broadly hypothesized that female ketamine users will demonstrate more signiﬁcant depression and altered sgACC connectivity in link with depression, as compared to male users.  2. Methods  2.1. Subjects and clinical assessments  The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the China Medical University Hospital (CMUH103-REC2-052). Candidates were assured at screening that their decision to participate in the study or not would not aﬀect their right to medical care, that all personal information would be kept conﬁdential, and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. Each participant provided a written informed consent prior to data collection.  Ketamine users (KU) and healthy control (HC) participants were recruited through posters at hospitals and online advertisements in the greater area of Taichung City, Taiwan. After consenting to the study, participants completed a clinical interview, questionnaire assessment, behavioral test, and magnetic resonance imaging.  KU met International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) criteria for ketamine use disorders and tested positive for ketamine in urine toxicology. A positive test result for other substances including methamphetamine, opioids, ecstasy, or marijuana, was an exclusion criterion. All HC participants denied use of any illicit substances and showed negative urine test results. None of the KU or HC participants had any major medical or neurological illnesses, history of brain concussion that resulted in loss of consciousness, or psychotic disorders.

Table 1 summarizes the key clinical characteristics of the participants.  2.2. Magnetic resonance imaging: procedures and parameters  Participants underwent an MRI scan, consisting of 6- to10-minute resting-state fMRI and high-resolution structural imaging. MR image data were acquired using a 3-Tesla scanner (Signa HDx, GE, Milwaukee, USA) at the Department of Radiology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. The high-resolution structural images were acquired in transverse plane along the AC-PC line. A three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled protocol with inversion recovery pulse prepared (3D-SPGR-IrP) sequence was used (parameters: TE = minimal; prep time = 450 ms; ﬂip angle = 12 degree; image matrix = 224 × 224; FOV = 224 mm × 224 mm; slice thickness = 1 mm; NEX = 1). The resting-state fMRI data were acquired using a gradient echo singleshot echo planar imaging sequence (parameters: TE = 35 ms; TR = 2000 ms; slice thickness = 4.4 mm; slice number = 32; image matrix = 64 × 64; FOV = 240 mm; total scan time = 10 min). Four dummy scans acquired at the beginning of EPI were discarded.  2.3. Imaging data pre-processing  Brain imaging data were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, U.K.). We followed standard procedures in image preprocessing, as in our recent work (Kann et al., 2016; Kline et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016a, 2016b). Images of each individual subject were ﬁrst realigned (motion corrected) and corrected for slice timing. A mean functional image volume was constructed for each subject per run from the realigned image volumes. These mean images were co-registered with the high resolution structural image and then segmented for normalization with aﬃne registration followed by nonlinear transformation (Ashburner and Friston, 1999; Friston et al., 1995). The normalization parameters determined for the structure volume were then applied to the corresponding functional image volumes for each subject. Finally, the images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm at Full Width at Half Maximum.  Additional preprocessing was applied to reduce spurious BOLD variances that were unlikely to reﬂect neuronal activity (Fair et al., 2007; Fox and Raichle, 2007; Fox et al., 2005; Rombouts et al., 2003). The sources of spurious variance were removed through linear regression by including the signal from the ventricular system, white matter, and whole brain, in addition to the six parameters obtained by rigid body head motion correction. First-order derivatives of the whole brain, ventricular and white matter signals were also included in the regression.  Cordes and colleagues suggested that BOLD ﬂuctuations below a frequency of 0.1 Hz contribute to regionally speciﬁc BOLD correlations (Cordes et al., 2001). Thus, we applied a temporal band-pass ﬁlter (0.009 < f < 0.08 Hz) to the time course in order to obtain low-frequency ﬂuctuations, as in previous studies (Fair et al., 2007; Fox and Raichle, 2007; Fox et al., 2005; Lowe et al., 1998).  As extensively investigated in Van Dijk et al., 2012, micro head  +  +r|  = ∆  + ∆  + ∆  +  d (t) z  d (t) x  d (t) y  γ(t) |  r β(t)  r α(t)  FD(t)  motion (> 0.1 mm) is an important source of spurious correlations in rsFC analysis (Van Dijk et al., 2012). Therefore, we applied a “scrubbing” method proposed by Power et al. (2012) and successfully applied in previous studies (Power et al., 2012; Smyser et al., 2010; Tomasi and Volkow, 2014) to remove time points aﬀected by head motions. Brieﬂy, for every time point t, we computed the framewise displacement given by , where z and (α, β, γ) are the translational and rotational movements, (d , d , d ) x respectively, and r ( = 50 mm) is a constant that approximates the mean distance between center of MNI space and the cortex and transform rotations into displacements (Power et al., 2012). The second head movement metric was the root mean square variance (DVARS) of the diﬀerences in % BOLD intensity I(t) between consecutive time points DVARS voxels, across (t) 1)|2 , where the brackets indicate the mean across = brain voxels. Finally, to compute each subject's correlation map, we removed every time point that exceeded the head motion limit FD (t) > 0.5 mm or DVARS(t) > 0.5% (Power et al., 2012; Tomasi and Volkow, 2014). On average, 1% of the time points were removed across subjects.  brain I(t  computed  follows:  |I(t)  −  y  −  as  2.4.

For individual subjects, we computed the correlation coeﬃcient between the averaged time course of seed region and the time courses of all other brain voxels. To assess and compare rsFC, we converted these image maps, which were not normally distributed, to z score maps by Fisher's z transform (Berry and Mielke, 2000; Jenkins and Watts, 1968): = . The Z maps were used in group, random eﬀect analyses. We performed a two-sample t-test to compare the Z maps of HC and KU and one-sample t-test on the Z maps of sgACC for HC and KU combined. We also performed analysis of variance with group and sex as two factors as well as covariance analysis to include variables of nicotine and alcohol use as covariates. Additionally, we performed whole brain simple regression analyses with CES-D as a regressor for KU. All results were examined with a voxel p < 0.05, corrected for family-wise error (FWE) of multiple comparisons or a combination of uncorrected voxel p < 0.001 and cluster p < 0.05, FWE corrected, on the basis of Gaussian random ﬁeld theory, in SPM, following current reporting standards (Eklund et al., 2016). Eﬀect sizes of regions of interest were derived with MarsBar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/) for additional analyses.  3. Results  3.1. Clinical assessments  For all clinical measures, we conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with group (KU vs. HC) and sex (men vs. women) as factors. The p values for main and interaction eﬀects are shown in Table 1. Compared to HC, KU showed higher CES-D score (p = 0.005); women also showed higher CES-D score as compared to men (p = 0.0004). Further, there was an interaction eﬀect (p = 0.002), with female KU showing a signiﬁcantly higher CES-D score than female HC (16.5 ± 6.2 vs.7.6 ± 4.8, p = 0.003, two-sample t-test) but no diﬀerence in men (6.3 ± 4.6 vs. 6.8 ± 4.8, p = 0.77). KU also showed signiﬁcantly higher cigarette and alcohol use than HC (Table 1).  3.2. Resting state functional connectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex  In a two-sample t-test we observed that KU and HC did not show diﬀerences in rsFC at a corrected threshold. Thus, we combined KU and  3  C.-S.R. Li et al.  Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 269 (2017) 1–8  Fig. 2. (A) One-sample t-test of whole brain functional connectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), p < 0.05 FWE, in all subjects. Positive and negative connectivities are shown each in warm and cool color. Scale represents voxel T value. Neurological orientation: R = right. ACC: anterior cingulate cortex; aTh: anterior thalamus; Bilat: bilateral; IFG/ AI: inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula; L: left; MFG: middle frontal gyrus; OC: occipital cortex; OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; R: right; STG: superior temporal gyrus; TP: temporal polar cortex; vmPFC: ventromedial prefrontal cortex. ANOVA showed (B) greater activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area (dACC/SMA) and midcingulate cortex (mCC) in men, as compared to women; and (C) an interaction eﬀect, with men showing greater connectivity than women in HC, as compared to KU, in bilateral occipital cortex (OC). Results of ANOVA were examined at a threshold of p < 0.001 uncorrected, combined with cluster p < 0.05, FWE corrected.  HC in a one-sample t-test of whole-brain connectivities of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC, Fig. 2A). The sgACC showed positive connectivity to the rostral ACC/medial prefrontal cortex/medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral temporal poles/superior temporal gyri, bilateral caudate head/ventral striatum/anterior thalamus, and negative connectivity to bilateral occipital cortex, bilateral inferior frontal cortex/anterior insula (rIFC/AI), bilateral middle frontal gyrus and left angular gyrus.  In an ANOVA of the z maps, we included group and sex as two factors. At a corrected threshold, KU and HC did not diﬀer in sgACC connectivity, consistent with the results of two-sample t-test. However, compared to women, men showed greater sgACC connectivity to the dorsal ACC/supplementary motor area (dACC/SMA, x = − 6, y = 20, z = 31, voxel Z = 4.97) and mid-cingulate cortex (mCC, x = 6, y = − 13, z = 34, voxel Z = 4.96) with a total volume of 21,411 mm3 (Fig. 2B). Further, an interaction eﬀect with KU (men – women) < HC (men – women) was observed in bilateral occipital cortices (x = −30, y = −88, z = 7, voxel Z = 4.46, 8127 mm3 and x = 36, y = − 73, z = −8, voxel Z = 4.21, 9288 mm3), with men showing greater connectivity than women in HC, as compared to KU (Fig. 2C).  3.3. Depression and sgACC connectivity  3618 mm3) and bilateral medial OFC (x = 3, y = 50, z = − 11, voxel Z = 3.63; 6156 mm3) for all KU. We also performed the analyses separately for men and women. At the same threshold, CES-D score positively correlated with sgACC connectivity to bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG, x = 66, y = − 37, z = 19, voxel Z = 3.97; 3834 mm3; and x = − 60, y = − 61, z = 4, voxel Z = 3.68; 2916 mm3) in male KU. CES-D score positively correlated with sgACC connectivity to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, x = − 6, y = 29, z = 52, voxel Z = 4.87; 3267 mm3) in female KU.  We derived the eﬀect sizes of connectivity of these three regions and tested for diﬀerences between KU and HC in the correlation with CES-D score (Fig. 3). The results showed that, with men and women combined, sgACC connectivity to the OFC was negatively and signiﬁcantly correlated with the CES-D (p = 0.00001, r = −0.66) in KU, but not in HC (p = 0.58, r = 0.13). Further, KU and HC signiﬁcantly diﬀered in the slope of the regressions (p = 0.001). For men, sgACC connectivity to the STG showed positive correlation with the CES-D both in KU (p = 0.00002, r = 0.74; n = 26 KU men) and in HC (p = 0.009, r = 0.74; n = 11 HC men). There was no diﬀerence between KU and HC in the slope of the regressions (p = 0.13). For women, sgACC connectivity to the dmPFC showed positive correlation with the CES-D in KU (p = 0.00003, r = 0.97) but not in HC (p = 0.69, r = −0.16); and the two groups diﬀered signiﬁcantly in the slope of the regressions (p = 0.03).  We performed whole brain simple regression of sgACC connectivity maps on CES-D scores in KU. At a combined threshold of uncorrected voxel p < 0.001 and FWE-corrected cluster p < 0.05, CES-D score negatively correlated with the sgACC connectivity to the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, x = 36, y = 20, z = −14, voxel Z = 4.97;  3.4. sgACC connectivity: cigarette and alcohol use as potential confounds  KU and HC diﬀered in the extent of cigarette and alcohol use (Table 1). We examined whether the ﬁndings described above were  4  C.-S.R. Li et al.  Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 269 (2017) 1–8  Fig. 3. sgACC connectivity in relation to depression.

We correlated the eﬀect size of sgACC connectivity of the OFC, STG, and dmPFC with days of cigarette use in the past month, years of cigarette use in life, days of alcohol use in the past month, and years of alcohol use in life. The results showed that there were no signiﬁcant correlations (all p's > 0.14) except for a trend-level negative correlation between the eﬀect size of STG and days of cigarette use in the prior month (p = 0.05, r = −0.39) as well as years of smoking (p = 0.07, r = −0.36) in men. None of these correlations were signiﬁcant when examined at a corrected threshold (of p < 0.05/12 = 0.0042).  We also conducted analysis of covariance for whole brain sgACC connectivity with group and sex as two factors and alcohol and nicotine use variables as covariates. The results were nearly identical (Section 3.2). There were sex main eﬀect and group by sex interaction eﬀect. Compared to women, men showed greater sgACC connectivity with the dACC/SMA (x = −6, y = 23, z = 31, voxel Z = 4.91) and mid-cingulate cortex (mCC, x = 6, y = −13, z = 34, voxel Z = 4.83) with a total volume of 19,980 mm3. There was an interaction eﬀect in bilateral occipital cortices (x = −30, y = −88, z = 7, voxel Z = 4.24, 4617 mm3; and x = 36, y = −73, z = −8, voxel Z = 3.98, 7263 mm3).  4. Discussion  Compared to non-drug using controls (HC), ketamine users (KU) did not demonstrate signiﬁcant changes in sgACC connectivity at a corrected threshold. However, in KU, a linear regression of sgACC connectivity against CES-D demonstrated less connectivity with the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and bilateral medial OFC (mOFC) in association with depression severity. Examined separately, male and female KU showed higher sgACC connectivity with bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), respectively, in correlation with depression. The sgACC connectivity to the OFC and dmPFC in relation to depression signiﬁcantly diﬀered between KU and HC. These ﬁndings are discussed in the below.  4.1. sgACC connectivity and depression in ketamine users  In KU the severity of depression is associated with decreased sgACC connectivity with lateral and medial OFC in men and women combined. The lOFC is involved in aﬀective regulation and emotional experience. For instance, ratings of subjective emotion were correlated with activation in the right lOFC during viewing of negative versus neutral  emotional images (Garrett and Maddock, 2006). The lOFC appeared to be speciﬁcally involved in reappraisal of negative emotions (Golkar et al., 2012). Higher neuroticism and introversion was associated with activation in the lOFC during losses in a card choice task to maximize proﬁts (Fujiwara et al., 2008). Individual diﬀerences in negative urgency (impulsive behavior under negative emotional states) was associated with lOFC activation during exposure to negative as compared to neural emotional images (Cyders et al., 2015). The mOFC plays an important role in determining the aﬀective tone of unconstrained thoughts (Tusche et al., 2014) and processing stimuli of positive affective value and those learned to be associated with stimuli of positive aﬀective value (Shenhav et al., 2013). Being in a congruent emotional state, irrespective of the valence of emotion, activates the mOFC (Kuhn et al., 2011). The medial and lateral OFC were each related to counterfactual thinking and regret in economic decisions (Sommer et al., 2009). Thus, lOFC and mOFC appears to respond to distinct emotional states. The ﬁnding of altered sgACC connectivity to both lOFC and mOFC suggest the possibility of dysregulation of both positive and negative emotions in chronic ketamine users.  4.2. Sex diﬀerences in sgACC connectivity in KU  Increased sgACC connectivity with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was associated with higher CES-D score in women but not in men. Previous studies have shown increased sgACC connectivity with the dmPFC in patients with major depressive disorder (Davey et al., 2012; Hamilton et al., 2011; Sheline et al., 2010). Increased sgACC connectivity with the dmPFC may be related to depression symptoms such as self-reproach and guilty rumination (Davey et al., 2012), in relation to the role of the dmPFC in autobiographical recall and self-referential analyses (Bado et al., 2014). Importantly, guilty rumination ﬁgured more prominently in women than in men with depression (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2012; Shors et al., 2017). A study combining fMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed a signiﬁcant negative correlation between GABA concentration in the dmPFC and BOLD signals in sgACC during exposure to sad face in contrast to control images (Stan et al., 2014). In individuals with treatment-refractory depression undergoing a 4-week course of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the dmPFC, higher baseline sgACC to dmPFC connectivity was associated with better treatment outcomes (Salomons et al., 2014). The latter ﬁnding support the importance of sgACC-dmPFC connectivity as a clinical biomarker of depression. However, as suggested by the current ﬁndings of sex  5  C.-S.R. Li et al.  diﬀerence, more work is warranted to elucidate whether and how sgACC-dmPFC connectivity inﬂuences cognitive and aﬀective functions diﬀerently in men and women with depression.  The superior temporal gyrus (STG) along with the dmPFC is involved in evaluating emotional facial and vocal expressions (Dricu and Fruhholz, 2016). Adults with childhood maltreatment exhibited increased STG activity during emotional processing (Hein and Monk, 2016). A meta-analysis associated an inter-connected network of brain regions including the STG during experiences of guilt (Gifuni et al., 2016). Individuals with social anxiety disorder demonstrated increased activation in the STG, insula, and medial frontal cortex during exposure to facial emotions (Binelli et al., 2014). An earlier study reported changes in sgACC activity and connectivity to a swath of cortical and subcortical structures including the STG and dmPFC during facial emotional processing in individuals exposed to mood deterioration induced by typhoid vaccination (Harrison et al., 2009). Algorithm of machine learning showed that sgACC connectivity with the STG may represent a diagnostic marker of major depression (Zeng et al., 2014). However, as with work on the dmPFC, none of these studies described how men and women diﬀered in STG responses or sgACC-STG connectivity during emotional processing. As men and women showed diﬀerences in sgACC connectivity with a wide limbic circuit that supports nociception (Wang et al., 2014) and with the saliency network in association with shyness (Yang et al., 2015), it is important to examine sex diﬀerences in sgACC activity and connectivity in association with emotion regulation and depression.  4.3. Limitations of the study and conclusions  A number of limitations are worth considering. First, we did not include a group of non-substance abusing individuals with depression for comparison, so it remained unclear whether the current ﬁndings were speciﬁc to chronic ketamine users or related broadly to depression. Second, although regression analyses largely ruled out an eﬀect of alcohol and cigarette use on the current ﬁndings, it remained unclear how these comorbidities may inﬂuence sgACC connectivity, particularly in terms of the interacting eﬀects with sex diﬀerences. That is, while the analyses did not reveal a signiﬁcant relationship between imaging ﬁndings and smoking/drinking variables, we could not conclude that the current ﬁndings are speciﬁc to ketamine misuse. Third, we did not assess history of childhood trauma, which can dispose individuals to depression, and this issue may be most relevant in the context of sex diﬀerences. Fourth, a few subjects underwent resting state fMRI for only 6 min; a longer scan duration would be needed to minimize within-subject variability in connectivity metrics (Tomasi et al., 2016). Finally, we targeted the sgACC in the current study, but other regions of the limbic circuit need to be investigated in future work for their role in the pathogenesis of depression in chronic ketamine users (Downey et al., 2016). In conclusion, we demonstrated altered sgACC connectivity in association with depression and sex diﬀerences in the altered patterns of connectivity in chronic ketamine users. These ﬁndings add to a growing literature of the addiction neuroscience of ketamine misuse.

This research suggests attentional control and reappraisal may engage similar midline and lateral areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, ﬁndings are largely based on separate studies. Therefore, the extent to which mechanisms of implicit versus explicit regulation are independent or overlapping is not clear. In the current study, 49 healthy participants completed well-validated implicit and explicit regulation tasks in the form of attentional control and cognitive reappraisal during functional magnetic resonance imaging. During implicit regulation, participants identiﬁed a target letter in a string of letters superimposed on threatening faces. To manipulate attentional control, the letter string either consisted of all targets (‘Threat Low’ perceptual load), or was embedded among non-target letters (‘Threat High’ perceptual load). During cognitive reappraisal, participants were shown aversive images and instructed to use a cognitive approach to down-regulate negative aﬀect (‘Reappraise’) or to naturally experience emotions without altering them (‘Look-Negative’). Order of administration of tasks was counterbalanced across participants. Whole-brain results regarding frontal activity showed ventromedial PFC/ rostral In contrast, Reappraise > Look-Negative resulted in engagement of the dorsolateral PFC, ventrolateral PFC and dorsomedial PFC. In addition, results showed no relationship between accuracy during attentional control and self-reported negative aﬀect during cognitive reappraisal. Results indicate attentional control in the context of threat distractors and the reappraisal of negative images are supported by discrete, non-overlapping neurocircuitries.  recruited during Threat Low > Threat High.  anterior  cingulate  cortex was  1. Introduction  Negative stimuli are preferentially attended to (LeDoux, 1998; Öhman and Mineka, 2001; Yiend, 2010), therefore, the ability to adaptively manage emotional response to salient negative cues has a positive eﬀect on day-to-day functioning and psychological health (Gross and John, 2003; Gross and Muñoz, 1995; Koole and Rothermund, 2011). As such, understanding the neural underpinnings of eﬀectual emotion regulation is an intensive area of study, due in part to its relevance in psychiatric illnesses that are characterized by disturbances in aﬀect and maladaptive behaviors to cope with negative emotions. Emotions unfold over time and various strategies exist for modulating the emotion-generative process (Gross, 2002; Gross and John, 2003). One way to conceptualize diﬀerences in emotion regulation strategies is through a dual-processes framework, which considers  regulation in the context of two distinct, yet related, processes deﬁned by implicit and explicit operations (Gyurak et al., 2011). Distinction between the two forms stem from variations in the eﬀort used to alter an emotional experience (Mauss et al., 2007).  Implicit regulation refers to processes that modify an emotional response without deliberate intent or conscious supervision (Hopp et al., 2011; Koole and Rothermund, 2011). An important aspect of implicit regulation is attentional control (e.g., resolution of emotional interference), an antecedent-focused strategy as it inhibits an emotional response to a stimulus before it becomes fully activated (Gross and Thompson, 2007). Due to processing capacity limits (Desimone and Duncan, 1995), sensory-driven, bottom-up stimuli compete with higher-order cognitive goals for neural representation and the stimulus that ‘wins’ the competition guides action and behavior (Pessoa et al., 2002). Factors that impact attentional control include the salience of  ⁎ Correspondence to: University of Illinois at Chicago, 1747 W, Roosevelt Rd. (M/C 747), Rm 246, Chicago, IL 60608, USA.

Neuropsychologia xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx  distractors (e.g., negative versus neutral task-irrelevant cues) and task demands as demonstrated with paradigms that vary in perceptual load. For instance, according to load theory, when perceptual load is low (e.g., when cognitive goals are easy to execute), task-relevant resources are available (i.e., ‘leftover’) to process emotional distractors (Lavie et al., 2009). Conversely, when a cognitive goal exhausts capacity limits (e.g., when goals are diﬃcult to execute), the processing of salient distractors is attenuated (Lavie et al., 2004, 2009). Put another way, the higher the cognitive eﬀort directed at completing a goal, the lower the emotional interference linked to task-irrelevant stimuli.  At the neural level, eﬀectual implicit regulation is implicated when frontal regions are recruited [e.g., anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC), lateral areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)] and activity in central emotion processing regions (e.g., amygdala) are reduced (Etkin et al., 2011a; MacDonald, 2000). In support of load theory, Bishop and colleagues showed ACC, dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC), and parietal regions were engaged during high perceptual load relative to low perceptual load in the context of brieﬂy-presented threat and neutral face distractors (i.e., 200 ms (milliseconds)), indicating the high load condition was demanding of processing resources (Bishop et al., 2007). Diﬀerences in cognitive eﬀort were also observed at the behavioral level as accuracy was higher and response times shorter in the low relative to high load condition (Bishop et al., 2007). Moreover, an a priori analysis revealed increased amygdala reactivity to threat face distractors in the low relative to high perceptual load condition (Bishop et al., 2007). Taken together, threat distractors were only processed when the condition allowed for residual task-relevant resources. Here, load was manipulated with letter strings superimposed on faces where the identiﬁcation of a target letter (X or N) was either embedded in a mixed string of letters (high perceptual load) or a homogeneous string of target letters (low perceptual load). Thus, the letters, a source of neutral information, may have served as a distractor from the emotional face particularly under high load conditions, as evinced by an absence of amygdala reactivity in this condition (Bishop et al., 2007). Recently, using a similar task we observed ACC recruitment during low perceptual load when the cognitive goal was easy to execute and distractors were salient (Bunford et al., 2017b; Wheaton et al., 2014). These data are in line with accumulating evidence that eﬀective attentional control engages the ACC (Etkin et al., 2011a, 2011b; MacDonald, 2000; Etkin et al., 2006; Kanske and Kotz, 2011).  In contrast to implicit regulation, explicit regulation refers to a deliberate attempt to inhibit or alter an emotional state in a speciﬁc direction (Gross and John, 2003; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). A wellstudied form of explicit regulation is cognitive reappraisal, also an antecedent-focused emotion regulation approach that involves changing the meaning of an emotion-eliciting stimulus or situation to alter its emotional impact (Gross, 2013; Ochsner et al., 2012). Studies, including meta-analytic investigations (Buhle et al., 2014; Messina et al., 2015), have consistently shown that cognitive reappraisal involves widespread cortical recruitment including areas associated with implicit regulation such as the ACC, DLPFC, DMPFC, and VLPFC. Less consistent with implicit regulation is evidence of engagement in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle and superior temporal gyri, and parietal regions including the angular gyrus (Buhle et al., 2014; Kohn et al., 2014; Messina et al., 2015; Ochsner et al., 2012). Involvement of these regions in particular may be due to the fact that cognitive reappraisal involves many higher-order functions (e.g., appraisal, attention, inhibition, working memory) as well as semantic functions to facilitate the generation of alternative representations of emotional stimuli (Messina et al., 2015). Behaviorally, self-reported aﬀective state based on a Likert-type scale is a common index of on-line reappraisal ability. In a seminal study by Ochsner and colleagues (Ochsner et al., 2002) greater reappraisal facility qualiﬁed by a larger diﬀerence in selfreported aﬀect between reappraising negative images (‘Reappraise’) versus looking at negative images (‘Look Negative’) corresponded with  more activation in the ACC and supramarginal gyrus and, in another study, with DMPFC activity (Modinos et al., 2010). In further support of brain-behavioral relationships, we recently demonstrated that greater engagement of frontal regions predicted successful reappraisal using self-reported ratings (Klumpp et al., 2018).  In summary, the eﬀective management of emotions elicited by a salient cue can be attained by means of attentional control modulated by perceptual load or cognitive reappraisal. While neuroimaging studies suggests shared and unique mechanisms underlie these implicit and explicit emotion regulation approaches, information regarding the spatial distribution of these neural circuitries are based on discrete studies completed in parallel, separate samples. Therefore, further study is necessary. Findings have implications in identifying phenotypes among internalizing conditions such as anxiety, depression, or other conditions marked by emotion dysregulation (e.g., excessive negative aﬀect) or individuals at risk of developing internalizing psychopathologies. In particular, in highlighting the relevance of load theory in advancing our understanding of attentional control as it relates to psychological health, we and others have shown that individual diﬀerences in the anxiety spectrum (e.g., trait anxiety, social anxiety disorder) and traits that act as a vulnerability factor to anxiety and depression (e.g., behavioral inhibition; Muris et al., 2001) are frequently observed when perceptual load is low (Bishop et al., 2007; Bunford et al., 2017b; Wheaton et al., 2014). It has also been demonstrated that anxious and depressed individuals exhibit aberrant neurofunctional activity during cognitive reappraisal to negative stimuli (Fitzgerald et al., 2017; Goldin et al., 2009; Radke et al., 2017; Stephanou et al., 2017). Furthermore, neural activity (i.e., ACC, amygdala) during reappraisal and to negative distractors under low (relative to high) perceptual load conditions predicts symptom change after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in socially anxious patients (Klumpp et al., 2017a).  In addition, ﬁndings have implications for the treatment of individuals characterized by emotion dysregulation (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders). For example, CBT is directed at enhancing emotion regulation with an amalgam of approaches (e.g., Socratic questioning, logical empiricism, behavioral ‘experiments’) over the course of multiple sessions (e.g., Arch and Craske, 2009). Evidence reappraisal is used more frequently in anxious patients who participate in CBT (Moscovitch et al., 2012) and reports of increased attentional control following CBT (Lundh and Öst, 2001; Mattia et al., 1993; Pishyar et al., 2008) suggest our understanding of treatment mechanisms could be advanced as CBT encompasses strategies analogous to reappraisal but does not directly target attentional control. Indeed, if attentional control and reappraisal engage similar neural pathways, it is expected that attentional bias modiﬁcation interventions, which are less costly and more readily available than CBT (Price et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016), would increase reappraisal capability. Alternatively, if mechanisms are discrete, the rate of response and/or attrition could be improved by tailoring CBT components to a patient's level of regulation facility in terms of implicit and explicit strategies as proﬁciency in one may not extend to the other. Findings also have inferences for neuromodulation as shared involvement of a targeted region (e.g., DLPFC) would broadly impact regulation capacity regardless of the eﬀort and processes involved. Conversely, the existence of a more distinct distribution of neural function across forms of regulation may necessitate reﬁnement in the selection of neural targets directed at regulation-speciﬁc operations.  Therefore, the primary objective of the current study was to examine mechanisms of implicit regulation in accordance with load theory and mechanisms of explicit regulation by way of cognitive reappraisal in the same sample of healthy individuals. We hypothesized that in the context of negative stimuli, both tasks would recruit dorsal midline structures (e.g., DMPFC), lateral frontal regions (e.g., DLPFC, VLPFC), and ACC. We also expected patterns would point to regulationdependent systems, for example, distinction between regions strongly  2  J.M. Fitzgerald et al.  Neuropsychologia xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx  implicated in reappraisal (e.g., IFG, temporal regions) (Buhle et al., 2014; Kohn et al., 2014; Messina et al., 2015; Ochsner et al., 2012) but not attentional control and vice versa (Bishop et al., 2007; Bunford et al., 2017b; Etkin et al., 2011b, 2006; Kanske and Kotz, 2011; MacDonald, 2000). Beyond neuroimaging, we explored whether there was a relationship between accuracy related to a cognitive goal (i.e., attentional control) and aﬀective state related to reappraisal to aid in the characterization of distinct or shared mechanisms involving implicit and explicit regulation strategies.  2. Methods  2.1. Participants  Participants consisted of 49 healthy adults between the ages of 18–60 (25.24 ± 7.98) with 12–22 years of education (15.65 ± 2.41). Sixty-seven percent of the sample was female and racial and ethnic composition consisted of: 45% Caucasian, 29% Asian, 14% AfricanAmerican, and 12% unknown; 22% percent of the identiﬁed as Hispanic. Inclusion criteria were: (1) absence of any major medical or neurological illness or Axis I disorder as conﬁrmed by diagnostic interviewing with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV (SCID-IV; (First et al., 2002) conducted at screening by trained master's level clinicians, (2) ability to give informed consent, and (3) free from drugs on the day of testing as conﬁrmed by a urinary drug screen. Exclusion criteria for fMRI included (1) the presence of ferromagnetic objects within the body, (2) being pregnant or actively trying to become pregnant, (3) fear of enclosed spaces (e.g., claustrophobia), and (4) inability to lie still in an enclosed space. All participants completed a consent form approved by the local Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Participants were compensated for their time and all procedures complied with the Helsinki Declaration.  2.2. fMRI tasks  All participants completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks during fMRI in the form of the Emotional Faces Interference Task (EFIT) and the Emotion Regulation Task (ERT), respectively. Task order was counterbalanced across all participants to control for order eﬀects.  2.2.1. Emotional Faces Interference Task (EFIT)  EFIT was adapted from Bishop et al. (2007) for the inclusion of both angry and fearful faces involving both genders as emotional distractors, with the present version previously validated in our laboratory (Bunford et al., 2017a, 2017b; Klumpp et al., 2017a; Wheaton et al., 2014). The balance of gender was matched across emotional faces. Participants viewed a string of six letters superimposed on task-irrelevant face distractors (e.g., angry, fearful, neutral) and were asked to identify whether there was an N or X present as quickly and accurately as possible. Participants were not explicitly instructed to ignore faces and responses were collected via button press. For low perceptual load trials, the string was comprised entirely of target letters (NNNNN or XXXXX) and in high perceptual load trials, the string included a single target letter and ﬁve non-target consonants (HKMWZ) in randomized order. Thus, low perceptual load was comparatively easier to perform. Distractor faces were drawn from a standardized set of photographs and consisted of fearful, angry, and neutral expressions from 8 diﬀerent individuals (Ekman and Friesen, 1976). The experiment was completed over two separate runs, each comprising 12 blocks of 5 trials. A mixed block/event-related design was employed whereby perceptual load (low vs. high) varied across blocks and facial expression (fearful, angry, neutral) within blocks on a trial-by-trial basis. Images were presented for 200 ms followed by a ﬁxation cross presented for 1800 ms. Within blocks, trials were separated by a jittered inter-stimulus interval lasting 2–6 s (s); trials between blocks were separated by 4–8 s.  2.2.2. Emotion Regulation Task (ERT)  In addition to EFIT, participants completed ERT validated in other labs (Ochsner et al., 2002) as well as our own (Fitzgerald et al., 2016, 2017; Klumpp et al., 2017b; MacNamara et al., 2016; Phan et al., 2005; Rabinak et al., 2014). During ERT, participants used cognitive reappraisal to down-regulate negative aﬀect state in response to negative images. Participants were shown 64 negative and 32 neutral images from the International Aﬀective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 2008) across three conditions (Reappraise, Look-Negative, Look-Neutral). Participants were instructed to: 1) use a cognitive strategy to reduce negative aﬀect to aversive images (‘Reappraise’ condition); 2) attend to the emotional state elicited by aversive images (‘Look-Negative’ condition); or 3) view neutral images (‘Look-Neutral’ condition). Prior to scanning and as per protocol (Fitzgerald et al., 2016, 2017; Klumpp et al., 2017b; MacNamara et al., 2016; Phan et al., 2005; Rabinak et al., 2014), participants were instructed to employ the strategy of cognitive reappraisal to “reduce [their] negative aﬀect by making the image appear less emotional”. Consistent with prior studies (Fitzgerald et al., 2016, 2017; Gorka et al., 2016; Klumpp et al., 2017b; MacNamara et al., 2016; Ochsner et al., 2002; Rabinak et al., 2014) participants were provided examples to promote understanding of cognitive approaches to reduce a negative emotional response to an aversive image. For example, transforming the scenario depicted by an image into positive terms (e.g., women crying outside of a church could be alternatively interpreted as expressing tears of joy from a wedding ceremony rather than of sorrow from a funeral) and rationalizing or objectifying the content of the pictures (e.g., a woman with facial bruises could be translated as an actor wearing makeup rather than a victim of domestic abuse; Phan et al., 2005, p. 211). Participants completed eight practice trials using images not shown in the actual task to conﬁrm understanding of task instructions.  The ERT comprised two separate runs, each lasting a total of 5 min. Each run consisted of two 20 s blocks of each condition (four images presented for 5 s each without inter-stimulus interval). Blocks were interspersed by 20 s blocks of a ﬁxation cross. Prior to each block, an instruction screen (“Reappraise” or “Look”) was presented for 5 s. To assess behavioral responses, participants viewed a screen that asked them to answer the question “How negative do you feel?” for the collection of on-line subjective negative aﬀect ratings immediately following each block. Participants indicated their response on a 5-item Likert scale (1 = not at all; 5 = extremely) via a 5-button response.  2.3. Behavioral data analysis  To verify participants followed EFIT and ERT task instructions, behavioral data were submitted to Analysis of Variances (ANOVAs) for each paradigm. Signiﬁcant ANOVA ﬁndings were followed-up with simple eﬀects analysis. Two-tailed Pearson's correlations were used to explore potential relationships between accuracy during EFIT Threat Low > Threat High trials and self-reported aﬀective state during ERT Reappraise > Look-Negative trials.  2.4. fMRI acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis  FMRI scanning was performed on a 3 T Discovery System (General Electric Healthcare; Waukesha, WI) using a standard radiofrequency coil. Whole-brain functional images (i.e., blood oxygen level–dependent [BOLD]) were collected using the following parameters: TR = 2 s, TE = 25 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, ﬁeld of view = 22 × 22 cm2, acquisition matrix 64 × 64; 44 axial, 3-mm-thick slices with no gap. The ﬁrst 4 volumes from each run were discarded to allow magnetization to reach equilibrium.  Conventional preprocessing steps were completed in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software package (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Images were temporally corrected to account for slice time acquisition diﬀerences  3  J.M. Fitzgerald et al.  Neuropsychologia xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx  and spatially realigned to the mean image to correct for head movement while motion realignment parameters were entered as regressors of nointerest to control for minimal head movement during scanning. Functional images from all participants included in analysis met criteria for quality with minimal motion correction (movements were < 3 mm and < 3 degrees rotation in any one direction). Images were then normalized to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using the echo-planar imaging template, resampled to 2 × 2 × 2 voxels and smoothed with an 8 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel.  For each task, a general linear model was applied to the time series, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and with a 128 s high-pass ﬁlter. For EFIT, blocks of low and high perceptual load were modeled separately based on task-irrelevant face type (angry, fearful, and neutral) resulting in six regressors (angry low, angry high, fearful low, fearful high, neutral low, neutral high), the eﬀects of which were estimated for each voxel for each participant and taken to the second level for random eﬀects analysis. Since negative stimuli are more salient than neutral stimuli, fearful and angry emotional distractors were combined (i.e., ‘threat’ distractors) to maximize power. Our primary contrast of interest was Threat Low > Threat High perceptual load in order to isolate neural activation during attentional control when distractors were more salient (e.g., high emotional interference due to low perceptual load). The analyses was repeated using Neutral Low > Neutral High to conﬁrm that any signiﬁcant eﬀects were driven by threat distractors. For ERT, blocks of Reappraise, LookNegative, and Look-Neutral were modeled separately in relation to implicit baseline (i.e., ﬁxation cross), the eﬀects of which were estimated for each voxel for each participant and taken to the second level for random eﬀects analysis. Our primary objective was to examine neural engagement signiﬁcantly related to cognitive reappraisal in relation to emotional reactivity; therefore, the primary contrast of interest was Reappraise > Look-Negative.  One-sample t-tests were performed in order to characterize the activation driving the primary linear contrasts of interest, as opposed to interaction eﬀects. Following recent guidelines in response to concerns about false positives resulting from lenient signiﬁcance thresholds (Eklund et al., 2016; Woo et al., 2014), all clusters were considered signiﬁcant only when they surpassed family-wise error (FWE) correction adjusted for multiple comparisons across the entire brain at p < 0.05 and comprising at least 20 contiguous voxels. The Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) system (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) was used to aid in the interpretation of regions within large clusters of activity.  To examine potential overlap in neural engagement between EFIT and ERT, binary masks based on signiﬁcant activation detected in one form of regulation were created and subjected to a conjunction analysis by looking for overlap using the logical AND operator in the SPM MarsBar toolbox (Brett et al., 2002), in keeping with the approach used by prior guidelines (Nichols et al., 2005). Additionally, overlap was examined with the common region function in the xjView toolbox (http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview), which displays the product of values from the contrasts of interest. Overlap was assessed using the minimum statistic for signiﬁcance generated by SPM using a wholebrain FWE-correction.  In subsequent exploratory analyses, we controlled for individual diﬀerences in behavior by adding the diﬀerence score between Threat Low and Threat High accuracy (for EFIT) and the diﬀerence score between self-report ratings during Reappraise and Look-Negative (for ERT) as covariates of no-interest in the respective one-sample t-tests (i.e., Threat Low > Threat High; Reappraise > Look Negative). In addition, we also explored whether neural activation could be explained by variability in accuracy in EFIT and self-reported aﬀective state in ERT. These analyses were completed to test the possibility that individual diﬀerences in behavior and reappraisal ability may account for variability in the distribution of neural activation. All planned and exploratory analyses controlled for age and gender.  4  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral results  3.1.1. EFIT  With regard to accuracy, a 2 (Perceptual Load: Low, High) × 2 (Distractor Type: Threat, Neutral) repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a main eﬀect of load (F(1, 48) = 310.96, p < 0.001), a main eﬀect of distractor type (F(1, 48) = 5.46), p = 0.02)) but no load-bydistractor type interaction (p = 0.31). Follow-up, paired-tests showed participants were more accurate during low load (90 ± 15%) compared to high load conditions (62 ± 13%) [t(48)= 17.63, p < 0.001] and when neutral distractors were present (77 ± 14%) compared to threatening distractors (75 ± 13%) [t(48)= 2.34, p = 0.02]).  A 2 (Load: Low, High) × 2 (Distractor Type: Threat, Neutral) repeated measures ANOVA on reaction time revealed a main eﬀect of load [F(1, 48)= 191.97, p < 0.001] but no main eﬀect for distractor type (p = 0.20); there was no load-by-distractor type interaction (p = 0.45). Follow-up paired t-tests revealed participants were faster during low load trials (7412 ± 247 ms) compared to high load trials (1058 ± 347 ms) [t(48) = 13.86, p < 0.001]. Results for behavioral data for both tasks across all conditions are listed in Table 1.  3.1.2. ERT  Behavioral data for ERT was available for all participants except in the case of one participant who had missing ratings during the LookNeutral condition. As this participant's ratings were present for the primary contrast of interest, Reappraise (> Look-Negative), the participant was retained in all analyses. A repeated measures ANOVA for Reappraise, Look-Negative, Look-Neutral revealed a main eﬀect of condition [F(2, 94) = 70.71, p < 0.001]. In follow-up paired t-tests, participants rated feeling more negative following Look-Negative conditions (2.53 ± 0.82) compared to Look-Neutral (1.20 ± 0.32) conditions [t(47) = 10.24, p < 0.001]. As expected, participants showed a reduction in negative aﬀect following Reappraise (2.18 ± 0.78) in comparison to Look-Negative (t(48) = 3.33, p < 0.01).  3.1.3. Correlation between EFIT and ERT behavioral rata  Pearson's correlation showed no relationship between accuracy during EFIT Threat Low (> Threat High) and self-reported aﬀective state during Reappraise (> Look-Negative) (p > 0.48).  3.2. fMRI results: Independent Task Engagement  3.2.1.

Discussion  low (perceptual  load was high)  The present study evaluated independent and common neural functioning at the whole-brain level with validated paradigms of attentional control, a form of implicit emotion regulation, and cognitive reappraisal, a form of explicit regulation. During attentional control, we observed engagement of VMPFC/rACC, PCC, and IPL when threat interference was high (perceptual load was low) compared to when threat interference was (i.e., Threat Low > Threat High). No signiﬁcant clusters were detected for neutral face distractors suggesting regions implicated in attentional control were recruited in the presence of threatening distractors. During cognitive reappraisal of negative images compared to naturally experiencing emotions evoked by negative images (i.e., Reappraise > LookNegative), we observed recruitment of DLPFC, VLPFC, DMPFC, temporal regions, parahippocampal gyrus, and cerebellar activations. There was no evidence of an overlap in neural engagement between these emotion regulation approaches when correcting for multiple comparisons across the entire brain. Behavioral data conﬁrmed participants followed instructions as exempliﬁed by higher accuracy and faster response times in the low relative to high perceptual load condition and reduced negative aﬀective state during reappraise compared to viewing negative images. Similar to neurofunctional ﬁndings, behavioral data pointed to task-dependent eﬀects as accuracy related to attentional control did not correlate with aﬀective state during cognitive reappraisal.  4.1. Neural signature of implicit regulation  Data provide partial support for hypotheses insofar as distinct, taskdependent mechanisms are concerned. Consistent with previous studies (Bishop et al., 2007; Bunford et al., 2017a; Wheaton et al., 2014), attentional control recruited the VMPFC extending to rACC. The VMPFC possesses heavy reciprocal connections with key emotion processing regions (e.g., the amygdala; (Sergerie et al., 2008; Zald, 2003) as well as with the lateral cortex involved in goal-directed behavior (Vogt et al., 1992). Similarly, the rACC is strongly connected with the amygdala as well as with dorsal ACC and involved in conﬂict control, response selection, and error detection (Bush et al., 2000). Therefore, ventral  activation  during  EFIT  Fig. 1.

No signiﬁcant clusters were observed for Neutral Low > Neutral High (p > 0.05 FWE corrected).  Results did not change when adding the diﬀerence score reﬂecting changes in accuracy between Threat Low and Threat High conditions as a covariate of no-interest. Similarly, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association between neural activation and accuracy.  3.2.2. ERT  Whole-brain ﬁndings for Reappraise > Look-Negative revealed recruitment of the left DLPFC (peak MNI coordinates: − 42, 12, 60; Z = 5.89; volume = 2464 mm3; p < 0.05 FWE corrected), right DLPFC (peak MNI coordinates: 18, 40, 56; Z = 5.23; volume = 1408 mm3; p < 0.05 FWE corrected), left VLPFC (peak MNI coordinates: − 50, 22, 12 & − 46, 36, − 10; Z = 4.70 & 4.59; volume = 672 mm3 & 480 mm3; p < 0.05 FWE corrected) right VLPFC (peak MNI coordinates: 40, 34, − 16; Z = 4.95; volume = 800 mm3; p < 0.05 FWE corrected), and a cluster spanning the left supplementary motor cortex and DMPFC (peak coordinates: − 6, 16, 64, Z = 5.56, volume = 4136 mm3, MNI p < 0.05 FWE corrected). Beyond frontal engagement, we observed recruitment in temporal regions, parahippocampal gyrus, and cerebellum.  Results did not change when adding the diﬀerence in self-reported negative aﬀect between Reappraise and Look-Negative conditions as a covariate and no signiﬁcant association between neural activation and diﬀerences in reported negative aﬀect were found. Fig. 1 depicts the spatial location of ERT and EFIT results; see Table 2 for all results.  3.3. fMRI results: Common Task Engagement  When assessing overlap between the masks derived from Threat Low > Threat High and Reappraise > Look-Negative, no signiﬁcant clusters were detected. In addition, no overlapping clusters were identiﬁed using the xjView common region approach.  5  J.M. Fitzgerald et al.  Table 2 Whole-brain voxel-wise t-test results.

In the context of negative stimuli, engagement of ventral midline regions may resolve threat interference through the integration of these two sources of information (Etkin et al., 2011b, 2006; Kanske and Kotz, 2011).  In addition to the involvement of hypothesized frontal regions, we also found evidence of the IPL and PCC recruitment during attentional control. The IPL plays a role in maintaining attention as well as responding to new, salient information speciﬁc to visual stimuli (SinghCurry and Husain, 2009). Its involvement in implicit regulation in the present study likely suggests engagement in general attention processes and/or response to face distractors. In contrast, the involvement of the PCC in the context of implicit regulation is diﬃcult to discern given that the function of the region in general is not entirely clear (Pearson et al., 2011). Nevertheless, involvement of the PCC in the context of emotion processing is in line with prior reports that the PCC is activated in response to emotional content (Maddock et al., 2003), and speciﬁcally in response to negative stimuli in comparison to neutral stimuli (Maddock et al., 2003). The co-activation of the PCC and rACC in the present study is particularly interesting in light of prior work demonstrating that the PCC is connected with the rACC (Cole et al., 2010). Both regions are also a part of the default mode network (DMN), a network of brain regions that are engaged during internally-directed focus (Raichle et al., 2001). The PCC is also a hub that interacts with attentional focus and arousal (Leech and Sharp, 2014). Accordingly, its activation may be tied to identifying target letters in the context of distractors or the state of arousal that results from engaging in a challenging cognitive task (i.e., attempting to respond both accurately and rapidly to stimuli presented for 200 ms). More research is needed to delineate the role of this region in this paradigm. Interestingly, we did not observe amygdala reactivity in the low relative to high load threat condition, which may be due to our whole-brain approach in determining signiﬁcant activation.  4.2. Neural signature of explicit regulation  With regard to explicit regulation, we observed engagement of the DLPFC, VLPFC, and DMPFC during cognitive reappraisal, which replicates prior reports (Buhle et al., 2014; Kanske et al., 2011; Messina et al., 2015; Ochsner et al., 2012). The DLPFC is involved in executive  6  functioning broadly-deﬁned, and is implicated in working memory (Arnsten and Jin, 2014), decision making (Lee et al., 2012), attentional control (Brosnan and Wiegand, 2017), and response selection (Yamagishi et al., 2016). Given these functions, DLPFC's role may be described as the active generation of strategies in order to execute goaldirected behavior (Corbetta et al., 2008; Corbetta and Shulman, 2002). In contrast, the VLPFC is involved in semantic processing (Marumo et al., 2014), categorization of objects (Corbetta et al., 2008; Corbetta and Shulman, 2002), and memory for semantic information (Nozari and Thompson-Schill, 2016). During emotion regulation, the VLPFC is also implicated in the generation of inner speech (Geva et al., 2011; Jones and Fernyhough, 2007; Morin and Hamper, 2012), which is believed to aid in the categorization of emotions (Kohn et al., 2014). The joint recruitment of DLPFC and VLPFC during cognitive reappraisal may represent the involvement of joint processes of emotional appraisal (sub-served by VLPFC) and reappraisal through the selection of an alternative emotional meaning (sub-served by DLPFC) to a negative image. With regard to DMPFC activation during cognitive reappraisal (Buhle et al., 2014; Diekhof et al., 2011; Kalisch, 2009), this region is thought to monitor changing emotional states, a feature of reappraisal (Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Ochsner et al., 2012).  Beyond these regions, we observed reappraisal-related activation in various structures spanning temporal and cerebellar regions, which is consistent with evidence that reappraisal relies on a widely distributed neural network. These regions in particular are consistent with metaanalytic work showcasing their involvement in reappraisal (Buhle et al., 2014; Kanske et al., 2011; Messina et al., 2015; Ochsner et al., 2012). The temporal cortex likely contributes to reappraisal through semantic and perceptual associations (Aggelopoulos and Rolls, 2005; Levy et al., 2004) as both processes are involved in cognitive reappraisal (Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Ochsner et al., 2012). With regard to reappraisal-related cerebellar activity, we hesitate to interpret its involvement, as the function of the cerebellum during cognitive reappraisal is not clear. Nevertheless, there is increasing recognition that the cerebellum plays a role in emotion processing (Snider and Maiti, 1976) and emotion regulation (e.g., 'cerebellar cognitive-aﬀective syndrome'; Parvizi et al., 2001; Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998). Therefore, its known function as a regulator of motor behavior (Bastian et al., 1999) may extend to functions involved in reappraisal (Sacchetti et al., 2009).  J.M. Fitzgerald et al.  Neuropsychologia xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx  4.3. Relationship between implicit and explicit regulation  Counter to expected results, there was no overlap in neural activity in regions involved in implicit and explicit emotion regulation. While surprising, evidence that neural involvement across the two tasks was spatially discrete is in line with some prior work that assessed overlap in brain regions involved in distraction (i.e., working memory task during the viewing of negative stimuli) and cognitive reappraisal (Dörfel et al., 2014). In this prior work, although similar brain regions were recruited in both regulation strategies (e.g., insula), a conjunction analysis failed to ﬁnd spatially-similar activation using a whole-brain FWE-corrected threshold. In contrast, another study found similar VLPFC, DLPFC, and DMPFC engagement between implicit regulation via aﬀect-labeling and cognitive reappraisal (Burklund et al., 2017), whereas a meta-analysis found overlap in the insula, pre- supplementary motor area (SMA), and VLPFC in assessing distraction by various means and aﬀect-labeling as implicit strategies alongside reappraisal, expressive suppression, and mindfulness (Morawetz et al., 2017). Based on this work, results are mixed in terms of whether there is neural overlap between implicit and explicit regulation strategies. Studies that do ﬁnd overlap highlight the involvement of several regions spanning the prefrontal cortex and insula in both strategies.  Inconsistencies among studies may be driven by the way in which implicit regulation is diﬀerentially operationalized, although the employment of cognitive reappraisal is relatively uniform. Implicit regulation is an umbrella term that includes attentional control, distraction, aﬀect labeling, reinforcer reevaluation, and extinction (Braunstein et al., 2017). In the present study, attentional control was manipulated by perceptual load, a form of implicit regulation that may not be comparable to other implicit regulation strategies (e.g., aﬀect-labeling, distraction by means of working memory). Also, diﬀerences in regulation approaches include the extent to which participants were made aware of emotional content. For example, in previous studies participants were instructed that they would be viewing negative images and engaging in implicit regulation via distraction or aﬀect-labeling (Burklund et al., 2017; Dörfel et al., 2014). In contrast, participants in our study were not told that face distractors conveyed emotional meaning. Appraising emotional content prior to regulation may alter the engagement of speciﬁc brain regions. Speciﬁcally, the insula, MPFC, and VLPFC are involved in emotional appraisal, in addition to emotion regulation. The insula is involved in interoceptive awareness of emotional states (Craig, 2009; Xu et al., 2016), while the MPFC is involved in evaluating one's own emotional experience and is activated to a greater extent during self-focused emotional monitoring (Ochsner et al., 2004). In addition, the VLPFC plays a role in semantic processing and action inhibition of emotional states, the former of which involves the appraisal of emotion (Kohn et al., 2014). Therefore, these regions are involved both in appraising and regulating emotions. Their shared involvement in distraction (e.g., when rehearsing a 9-digit number during the viewing of negative stimuli; Dörfel et al., 2014), aﬀect-labeling and cognitive reappraisal in previous work may be due to the fact that these tasks made emotional content explicit. However, more work is needed on this topic. In particular, one of these prior studies found overlap between distraction/aﬀect-labeling and reappraisal in the DLPFC, a region involved more in regulation than emotional processing (Golkar et al., 2012). Therefore, future studies are needed to precisely parse-out the contribution of appraisal-related neural activation.  In addition, these prior studies tested implicit and explicit regulation strategies within the same task design, requiring participants to switch between strategies within a shorter timeframe (e.g., on the order of seconds). In contrast, two separate tasks of attentional control and cognitive reappraisal were utilized in the current study. As a result, this approach gave participants a period of rest between the collection of fMRI signal speciﬁc to implicit and explicit strategies and did not require participants to switch between strategies. Temporal lag and dissociation of tasks may have reduced carryover eﬀects. Relatedly, there  may be individual diﬀerences with regard to whether participants are able to eﬀectively switch strategies within short timeframes (e.g., on the order of seconds) which may contribute to the sustained use of one strategy over another, even when instructed to switch. In particular, prior behavioral studies have found individual diﬀerences in the ability to switch between distraction and reappraisal (e.g., dynamic emotion regulation) (Birk and Bonanno, 2016). As a result, controlling for the ability to switch strategies is an important consideration for future studies mapping distinct versus shared neural networks of regulation. To note, distinct neurocircuitries of implicit and explicit regulation is supported by prior work. That is, prior reports qualify that these two regulation strategies are dissimilar in terms of eﬀort, time course, and eﬃciency (Gyurak et al., 2011). In terms of the separation of neural substrates, prior work emphasizes the role of the VMPFC/rACC in regulation of aﬀective experiences, in contrast to dorsal regions (e.g., DMPFC) playing a stronger role in the evaluation of stimuli (Etkin et al., 2011b). That we found VMPFC/rACC involvement during implicit regulation, but DMPFC involvement in explicit regulation ﬁts with this framework, as the cognitive reappraisal process inherently involves appraisal of emotional state for reinterpretation purposes. In contrast, implicit regulation in the form of attentional control over emotional distractors does not likely involve appraisal, but rather, quick management of competing stimuli that demand conﬂict resolution.  4.4. Study limitations  Findings from the present study should be considered in light of important limitations. First, implicit emotion regulation was studied with an emotional interference task that varied in perceptual load and cognitive reappraisal was used to examine explicit emotion regulation. Also, participants were given examples of cognitive approaches that provided alternative paths to cognitive change to aid in clarifying what was meant by ‘reappraisal’. These factors may reduce generalizability. Second, while these tasks were validated across diﬀerent laboratories, a limitation of this approach is the use of diﬀerent task stimuli and experimental design. In other words, faces were used for implicit regulation in a mixed/block event-related design (i.e., EFIT) and images were used for explicit regulation in a block design (i.e., ERT). Furthermore, the duration of these stimuli diﬀered due to diﬀerences in the function of the task. For example, the brief presentation of stringplus-face stimuli in EFIT (200 ms) is in line with automaticity, a component of implicit regulation (Gross and Thompson, 2007); moreover, the short stimulus duration reduces the potential of shifting of attention from one location to another. Yet, the duration of stimuli in EFIT would likely be too brief for reappraisal, an eﬀortful, cognitive strategy involving various executive functions. Therefore, a failure to detect signiﬁcant overlap in the spatial distribution of brain activation during these forms of emotion regulation may be the consequence of diﬀerences between paradigms. Another factor that may have reduced our ability to identify shared mechanisms is the use of a stringent wholebrain threshold, which diﬀers in approach from prior work (Burklund et al., 2017). What constitutes signiﬁcant neural activity in fMRI research is on-going (Eklund et al., 2016; Woo et al., 2014) and in lieu of a gold standard criterion, we followed current guidelines (Woo et al., 2014) to protect against Type I error, which may be overly conservative (Lieberman and Cunningham, 2009). Lastly, results are based on healthy participants, therefore, ﬁndings may not generalize to a clinical population.  5. Conclusions  Despite these limitations, results from this work provide support for distinct neural circuits characterized by VMPFC in the context of implicit emotion regulation and DLPFC, VLPFC, and DMPFC in the context of explicit emotion regulation. The uniqueness of these neural circuits is also supported by behavioral data as no relationship between accuracy  7  J.M. Fitzgerald et al.  Neuropsychologia xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx  related to attentional control and self-reported aﬀective state during reappraisal was detected. The implications of this work are relevant for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses that possess diﬃculty in downregulating negative aﬀect by means of implicit and explicit regulation strategies.

In this study, we used fMRI to investigate how positive and negative expectation can change pain experiences in the same cohort of subjects. We ﬁrst manipulated subjects' treatment expectation of the effectiveness of three inert creams, with one cream labeled “Lidocaine” (positive expectancy), one labeled “Capsaicin” (negative expectancy) and one labeled “Neutral” by surreptitiously decreasing, increasing, or not changing respectively, the intensity of the noxious stimuli administered following cream application. We then used fMRI to investigate the signal changes associated with administration of identical pain stimuli before and after the treatment and control creams. Twenty-four healthy adults completed the study. Results showed that expectancy signiﬁcantly modulated subjective pain ratings. After controlling for changes in the neutral condition, the subjective pain rating changes evoked by positive and negative expectancies were signiﬁcantly associated. fMRI results showed that the expectation of an increase in pain induced signiﬁcant fMRI signal changes in the insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray, whereas the expectation of pain relief evoked signiﬁcant fMRI signal changes in the striatum. No brain regions were identiﬁed as common to both “Capsaicin” and “Lidocaine” conditioning. There was also no signiﬁcant association between the brain response to identical noxious stimuli in the pain matrix evoked by positive and negative expectancies. Our ﬁndings suggest that positive and negative expectancies engage different brain networks to modulate our pain experiences, but, overall, these distinct patterns of neural activation result in a correlated placebo and nocebo behavioral response.  © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Physicians and clinical investigators have found that positive expectancy of relief can enhance the therapeutic effect of treatment and negative expectancy can diminish it (Atlas and Wager, 2012; Atlas et al., 2012; Bingel et al., 2011; Carlino et al., 2014; Finniss and Benedetti, 2005; Finniss et al., 2010; Tracey, 2010). In the context of pain perception, positive expectations of treatment can elicit analgesia while negative expectation can elicit hyperalgesia. In a clinical setting, it has been demonstrated that either or both placebo (positive  ☆ One-sentence summaries: The placebo and nocebo effects indicated by subjective pain rating changes were signiﬁcantly associated; yet, the involved brain networks indicated by fMRI signal changes are different.  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Psychiatry Department, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 120, 2nd Ave. Suite 101 Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.

There is an increasing body of literature suggesting that placebo effects can enhance the therapeutic beneﬁts of care through the context in which the treatment is administered (Brody and Miller, 2011; Cleophas, 1995; de la Fuente-fernandex et al., 2002; Di Blasi et al., 2001; Finniss et al., 2010; Kaptchuk, 1998; Price et al., 2008; Thomas, 1994). Similarly, there is evidence suggesting that negative expectations can contribute to a variety of side effects and adverse events in clinical trials and medical care (Amanzio et al., 2009; Barsky et al., 2002; Colloca and Finniss, 2012; Petersen et al., 2014). Investigators have explored the neurobiological mechanisms underlying placebo analgesia extensively over the past decades. Many have employed brain imaging technologies (Amanzio et al., 2013; Atlas and Wager, 2012; Benedetti, 2008; Benedetti et al., 2006; Buchel et al., 2014; Enck et al., 2008; Finniss and Benedetti, 2005; Finniss et al., 2010; Kong et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2009; Tracey, 2010; Zubieta and Stohler, 2009). Relatively fewer studies have focused on nocebo hyperalgesia (Benedetti et al., 2003; Colloca and Benedetti, 2007; Colloca and Finniss, 2012; Geuter  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.015 1053-8119/© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  198  S. Freeman et al. / NeuroImage 112 (2015) 197–207  and Buchel, 2013; Kong et al., 2008; Schmid et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2008).  In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the placebo and nocebo effects, it is important not only to understand them separately but also study the association between them. It is not yet clear whether any or all of the mechanisms that have been proposed to account for positive and negative modulation of pain perception are contributory, singly or in combination. Moreover, there is no clear consensus on whether bidirectional mechanisms contribute to placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia or whether they are completely separable cognitive constructs. To date, only a few studies have directly compared placebo and nocebo effects. Most of these studies have involved behavioral measures only (Benedetti et al., 2003, 2014; Colloca et al., 2008, 2010). Based on the existing data, investigators have formed two main hypotheses regarding the relationship between placebo and nocebo effects (Petrovic, 2008; Scott et al., 2008). One postulates that placebo and nocebo are manifestations of the same type of brain network with different activation/deactivation changes or, using Petrovic's term, ‘sides of the same coin’ (Petrovic, 2008). The other posits that placebo and nocebo are separate cognitive constructs grounded in different behavioral patterns and their associated brain networks (Benedetti et al., 2006; Kong et al., 2008).  In the present experiment, we ﬁrst manipulated subjects' treatment expectation of the effectiveness of three inert creams, with one cream labeled “Lidocaine” (positive expectancy), one labeled “Capsaicin” (negative expectancy), and one labeled “control” by surreptitiously decreasing, increasing or not changing, respectively, the noxious stimulus intensity after application. We then investigated the subjective pain rating and fMRI signal changes associated with administration of identical pain stimuli before and after the different “treatments.” Our study is unique in that it involved the use of a completely inert treatment, a moisturizing cream, to elicit both placebo and nocebo effects within each individual subject in the same session. This experimental design allowed us to investigate the association between the placebo and nocebo effects and directly compare the brain networks between these two important clinical phenomena in the absence of active medication.  Methods  The Institutional Review Board at Massachusetts General Hospital approved all study procedures. All enrolled subjects provided written informed consent before beginning any study procedures and we debriefed them at the end of the study. All subjects were offered the option to remove their data from the study if they had any concerns due to the inherent need for deception in the experimental paradigm. No subject reported any concern and all subjects allowed their data to be used.  Subjects  Healthy, right-handed, English-speaking subjects participated in the study. We excluded individuals who reported ongoing or past major medical, neurological, or psychiatric illnesses; pregnancy, breast feeding, menopause, and/or irregular menstrual cycles; a history of substance abuse or dependence; a history of impaired urinary elimination; use of psychotropic drugs within the past year; claustrophobia; head trauma; or any other contraindications to MRI.  Experimental design  The study involved three sessions, each separated by 2–14 days: a training session, a conditioning session, and a scan session. In all sessions, we delivered calibrated heat pain stimuli to the right volar forearm of each subject using a Pathway Medoc (Contact Heat-Evoked Potential Stimulator, Medoc LTD Advanced Medical Systems, Rimat Yishai, Israel). All stimuli initiated at a baseline temperature of 32 °C  and subsequently increased to a given target temperature. Each stimulus lasted 12 s, including a ramp up from baseline (2.5 s) to the target temperature (7 s) and a ramp down to baseline (2.5 s).  Session 1  In the training session, we familiarized subjects with the heat pain stimuli and the Gracely Scales (0–20) (Gracely et al., 1978a, 1978b) that they would use to rate their pain in order to determine the temperatures required to elicit heat pain for each subject and control for rating strategy and learning effects (Kong et al., 2006, 2008).  Speciﬁcally, we drew a 3 × 3 grid comprised of 2 × 2 cm regions on the right volar forearm of the subject (2 columns on the inner arm and a third column on the radial, lateral part of the arm). We then administered one or two ascending sequences consisting of stimuli that got progressively more painful over the course of the sequence followed by one or two sequences consisting of three mild [rated as 5–6 out of 20], three moderate [rated as 10–11 out of 20], and three strong [rated as 14–15 out of 20] pain stimuli interspersed in random order. Finally we administered one or two sequences consisting of six identical moderate heat pain stimuli. Each sequence was administered to a separate region within the grid on the forearm.  Session 2  Session 2 was a behavioral conditioning session. This session involved an expectancy manipulation model employed in some of our laboratory's previous studies (Kong et al., 2006, 2008, 2009a, 2009b). We informed all subjects that the aim of the study was to investigate the analgesic effect of Lidocaine cream and the hyperalgesic effect of Capsaicin cream on their experience of pain. We told subjects that we would apply three creams (Lidocaine, Capsaicin, and a neutral moisturizing cream) to different regions of their right volar forearm and test their response to heat pain stimuli both before and after the application of the creams (Fig. 1).  In reality, we used three samples of one inert moisturizing cream, each dyed a different color. One sampling was dyed light blue and labeled “Lidocaine,” one was dyed pink and labeled “Capsaicin,” and one was left white and labeled “neutral.”  We drew a 3 × 3 grid identical to that of Session 1 on the inner arm of each subject and proceeded to administer 9 heat pain sequences (one sequence per square on the grid), each about 6 min in duration and each including 6 identical heat pain stimuli at the temperature that elicited a moderate (10–11 out of 20) rating as determined in the previous session. Then we applied one cream to each row (set of 3 adjacent squares) on the grid and counterbalanced the order of cream application across subjects. To balance the design, we started the administration of sequences of heat pain stimuli at the most lateral column and moved medially across all subjects. We told subjects that we would wait 15–20 min for the creams to take effect and to identify any allergic reactions they might have to the creams. We also read them a script stating that those who experience decreased pain from the Lidocaine and enhanced pain from the Capsaicin should continue and consistently respond that way over the course of the study.  Following the 20-minute waiting period after cream application, we conducted the experimental manipulation. In this conditioning paradigm, we informed subjects that they would be receiving 9 heat pain stimuli sequences comprised of stimuli at temperatures identical to those they had received prior to cream application. In reality, we surreptitiously lowered the heat to temperatures that elicited mild pain ratings in the “Lidocaine” squares, and raised the temperatures to elicit strong pain ratings in the “Capsaicin” squares. To reinforce these effects, identical moderate intensity stimuli were administered to the neutral squares (Eippert et al., 2009; Kong et al., 2006; Scott et al., 2008; Wagner et al., 2005). Only subjects who could distinguish between the pre- and post-treatment stimuli on the “Lidocaine” and “Capsaicin” regions, as indicated by average pain ratings, were permitted to continue with the study.  S. Freeman et al. / NeuroImage 112 (2015) 197–207  199  post-treatment changes in subjective pain ratings and fMRI signal changes evoked by the post-treatment identical moderate pain stimuli serve as the primary outcomes of this study (Fig. 1).  During scanning, subjects were instructed to focus on a small black ﬁxation cross in the center of a screen in front of them. The ﬁxation cross turned red to cue the onset and duration of each heat pain stimulus (12 s) and then turned black during the variable inter-stimulus interval duration (4, 6, or 8 s). After administration of each stimulus, we displayed the Gracely Sensory Scale on the screen (8 s) and subjects used a button press device controlling a pointer to indicate their subjective ratings. We also measured expectancy with the scales used in Session 2 before treatment, immediately after the treatment boost, and after the scan was complete.  fMRI data acquisition and analysis  We performed brain imaging with a three-axis gradient head coil in a 3-Tesla Siemens TIM Trio MRI System equipped for echo-planar imaging. We acquired thirty axial slices (4 mm thick with 1 mm skip) parallel to the anterior and posterior commissure covering the whole brain with 2000 ms repetition time, 40 ms echo time, 90° ﬂip angle, and 3.13 × 3.13 mm in-plane spatial resolution. We also collected a high-resolution 3D MPRAGE sequence and diffusion data (reported elsewhere) for anatomic localization.  We performed preprocessing and statistical analyses using SPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Preprocessing included motion correction, normalization to MNI stereotactic space, and spatial smoothing with an 8 mm Gaussian kernel. We calculated a GLM (general linear model) design matrix for each subject, including all 18 pain functional runs (1 run before and 1 run after treatment on each of the 9 “Lidocaine”, “Capsaicin” and neutral sites, see Fig. 1), modeling each pain stimulus and rating scale as events. We used this to generate the following contrast maps: 1) all pretreatment pain functional runs; 2) comparisons of before and after treatment on “Lidocaine,” “Capsaicin,” and control sites when identical pain stimuli were applied; and 3) contrasts comparing pre minus post differences in response to identical pain stimuli among each different condition (“Lidocaine,” “Capsaicin,” and control) separately.  We performed group analysis using a random-effects model and a paired t-test to determine group activation for each generated contrast as described above. We also performed a regression analysis between each subject's fMRI signal changes and the corresponding subjective pain rating changes. We set a threshold of family-wise error (FWE) correction at p b 0.05 after small volume correction (svc). We used brain regions implicated in reward processing, anxiety, and pain regulation as independent regions of interest (ROIs) for svc.  For the reward network, we used the bilateral ventral striatum (±14, 10, −10, radius of the sphere = 6 mm) obtained from a study of another research group (O'Doherty et al., 2004), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) (±2, 44, 10, radius of the sphere = 12 mm) (Kong et al., 2006), as well as the caudate and putamen deﬁned using the corresponding AAL (automatic anatomical labeling) mask (TzourioMazoyer et al., 2007). For the anxiety network, we used the hippocampus and amygdala, deﬁned using the corresponding AAL mask. For the pain modulation network, we used the periaqueductal gray (PAG) (± 6, − 26, − 10, radius of the sphere = 6 mm) (Behrens et al., 2003), orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) (± 38, 46, − 4, radius of the sphere = 12 mm) (Ochsner et al., 2006) dorsal–medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) (± 4, 23, 27, radius of the sphere = 12 mm) (Wager et al., 2004), the dorsal ACC (± 2, 32, 19, radius of the sphere = 12 mm) (Wager et al., 2004), and anterior insula using the corresponding AAL mask. For non-ROI brain regions, we used a voxel-wise threshold p b 0.005 uncorrected with 25 contiguous voxels and p b 0.05 FWE corrected at cluster level. All coordinates were reported in MNI coordinates, as used by SPM.  Fig. 1. Experimental procedure. In Session 2, 9 moderate heat pain sequences were applied on a 3 × 3 grid on the right inner arm. Then we administered one cream to each row on the grid and counterbalanced the order of cream application across subjects. Following the 20minute waiting period, we surreptitiously lowered the heat pain intensity in the “Lidocaine” squares, raised the heat pain intensity in “Capsaicin” squares and used identical moderate stimuli in the neutral squares. In Session 3, subjects were informed we would repeat the same procedure of Session 2 in fMRI scanner. In realty, we only surreptitiously changed the pain intensity at one “Lidocaine” and one “Capsaicin” square. For the rest of spots, we applied identical moderate pain stimuli.  Before and after conditioning in Session 2, we measured expectancy with two scales by asking each subject to rate how much they expected Lidocaine to relieve their pain (0–10 scale, with 0 indicating no change and 10 indicating complete relief) and how much they expected Capsaicin to enhance their pain (0–10 scale, with 0 indicating no change and 10 indicating extreme pain sensitivity).  Session 3  The third session took place in the MRI scanner. We informed subjects that the proceedings of Session 3 would be identical to those of Session 2. In reality, Session 3 was designed to test the placebo and nocebo effects evoked by the expectancy manipulation in Session 2. Thus, the process of Session 3 was identical to that of Session 2, with the exception that it took place in the fMRI scanner and the temperature of the post-treatment heat pain was moderate on the ﬁnal 6 regions demarcated on the volar forearm. First, we applied moderate heat pain stimuli (pre-treatment pain) to all nine regions. Then, we administered the creams while the subject remained in the scanner. As in Session 2, we waited 15–20 min and told the subjects that this time would allow for the creams to take effect. During this 15–20-minute wait period, we ran structural brain scans. Then we started heat pain stimuli application again. In order to re-boost the expectancy of the subjects, we surreptitiously altered the temperature of the heat pain stimuli (lowered to evoke mild pain for “Lidocaine” and raised to evoke strong pain for “Capsaicin” with no change for neutral) administered to the 3 boxes in the most lateral column of the 3 × 3 grid. Last, we administered identical moderate pain stimuli to the remaining 6 boxes in the center and medial rows of the grid on the forearm (post-treatment pain). The pre- and  200  Results  Behavioral results  S. Freeman et al. / NeuroImage 112 (2015) 197–207  Thirty-eight volunteers consented to participate in the study. Twenty-four healthy adults (12 male) aged 21 to 49 completed the study. Three subjects withdrew from the study, one due to discomfort with the heat pain and two due to scheduling issues. Eleven subjects were excluded after Session 1 or 2, seven due to the inability to reliably distinguish between high and low pain intensities, and four due to equipment malfunctions. Data from all 24 subjects who completed Session 3 were included in the analysis.  We present the subjective pain ratings from Session 3 in Table 1 and Fig. 2. A 2 × 3 (time by condition) repeated measures ANOVA indicated a signiﬁcant main effect for condition, F(1,23) = 22.83, p b .001, eta2 = .50, qualiﬁed by a signiﬁcant time by condition interaction, F(2,46) = 26.37, p b .001, eta2 = .53. Post hoc comparisons using Bonferroni corrections indicated that “Lidocaine” lowered pain (p b .001) and “Capsaicin” increased pain ratings (p = .002) compared to the neutral cream. Similarly, within-condition t-tests indicated that pain ratings decreased in the “Lidocaine” condition, t(23) = −4.83, p b .001, and increased in the “Capsaicin” condition, t(23) = 3.18, p = .004, but did not change signiﬁcantly in the neutral cream condition (p = .459).  Expectancy ratings for pain relief from “Lidocaine” and pain exacerbation from “Capsaicin” are shown in Table 2. To check the effect of the conditioning procedure on expectancy, we performed a 5 × 2 (time by “Lidocaine”/“Capsaicin”) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on these ratings. The ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for time, F (4,92) = 26.60, p b .001, eta2 = .54. Post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni corrections indicated that expectancy ratings increased following the conditioning procedure in Session 2 (p b .001) and did not change signiﬁcantly until after the post-treatment test in Session 3 when they decreased (p b .001) to a level that was not signiﬁcantly different from pre-conditioning expectancy ratings. There was no signiﬁcant difference between Session 2 and Session 3 in expected pain relief from “Lidocaine” or expected pain exacerbation from “Capsaicin,” nor did the interaction between type of cream and time of assessment approach signiﬁcance.  We also conducted a paired sample t-test on pre- and posttreatment values in the “Lidocaine” and “Capsaicin” conditions to directly compare the magnitude of positive and negative expectancy. The results indicated that the positive expectancy effect was signiﬁcantly greater than the negative expectancy effect, t(23) = 2.10, p = .047.  To explore the within subject association between the pre- and posttreatment pain rating change after application of “Capsaicin”, “Lidocaine” and neutral creams, we applied Pearson correlation among the three conditions. We found a signiﬁcant correlation between the “Capsaicin” and neutral cream (r = 0.56, p = 0.006) and between “Lidocaine” and neutral cream (r = 0.54, p = 0.005) conditions, but no signiﬁcant correlation between the “Capsaicin” and “Lidocaine” conditions (r = −0.08, p = 0.72). This pattern of correlation suggests that neutral cream ratings were functioning as a suppressor variable, decreasing the association between the effects of “Capsaicin” and “Lidocaine.” We tested this idea further by regressing “Capsaicin” induced pain rating changes on neutral and “Lidocaine” induced pain rating changes. With neutral cream ratings controlled, the partial correlation between the “Lidocaine” response and the “Capsaicin” response was  Fig. 2. Subjective pain rating differences (Mean ± SD) in Session 3.  −.54 (p = .008), indicating that a greater positive expectancy effect was associated with a greater negative expectancy effect.  In this study, we also measured several psychological variables including the Life orientation test (LOT), Behavioral Appetitive Scale (BAS), and Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS). To explore the association of these psychological measurement and the placebo/nocebo effects, we also performed a Pearson correlation analysis. The results showed no signiﬁcant association between the psychological variables and the placebo/nocebo effects [LOT: Placebo (p = 0.13), Nocebo p = 0.73; BAS: Placebo (p = 0.57), Nocebo (p = 0.94); TAS: Placebo (p = 0.14), Nocebo (p = 0.78)]. We speculate that this ﬁnding may be due to the small sample size of the study.  fMRI results  Main effect of pain perception  To delineate pain responsive brain regions we calculated a contrast between all pre-treatment pain stimuli (12 s each) and baseline (pain minus implicit baseline) using all nine scans. The comparison yielded signiﬁcant activations (voxel-wise p N 0.005, uncorrected with 20 contiguous voxels) in the entire predicted network of pain-responsive regions including the bilateral insular/opercular cortices, dorsal ACC (dACC)/dmPFC, caudate, putamen, and cerebellum (Fig. 3). The opposite contrast revealed signiﬁcant activation in the bilateral ventromedial dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex (Fig. 3). These main effects are consistent with previous ﬁndings on the patterns of pain-elicited neural activation and deactivation (Kong et al., 2010a).  Direct comparison between positive expectancy (“Lidocaine”) and negative expectancy (“Capsaicin”) conditions  We performed paired t-tests to directly compare pre-/post fMRI signal change differences in response to identical moderate intensity pain stimuli administered under positive (“Lidocaine”) and negative (“Capsaicin”) expectancy conditions (Table 3 and Figs. 4 & 5). The contrast of “Lidocaine” (pre N post) N “Capsaicin” (pre N post) identiﬁed brain regions that showed enhanced activation during pain administration in positive expectancy relative to negative expectancy (Table 3, Fig. 4). This contrast revealed signiﬁcant differences in the dACC, right orbitoprefrontal cortex (OPFC), and left anterior insula. We extracted  Table 1 Subjective pain ratings in response to identical pain stimuli pre- and post-cream application in Session 3 (Mean ± SD).

Interestingly, the dACC region showed a unique pattern of enhanced activation in the pre-treatment “Lidocaine” condition relative to the pre-treatment “Capsaicin” condition that reversed post treatment. In contrast, the left anterior insula and right DLPFC showed comparable pre-treatment activation in the two conditions that diverged post-treatment in the direction consistent with the response of the pain responsive networks, e.g. increased after “Capsaicin” and decreased after “Lidocaine.” The opposite contrast [“Capsaicin” (pre N post) N “Lidocaine” (pre N post)] revealed no regions above the threshold.  To identify brain regions that exhibited activity in opposite directions during pain administration in the “Lidocaine” and “Capsaicin” conditions, we performed two additional contrasts (Table 3, Fig. 5). First, we compared “Lidocaine” (pre N post) to “Capsaicin” (post N pre). The left ventral striatum was signiﬁcantly activated in this comparison. The opposite contrast [“Capsaicin” (post N pre) minus “Lidocaine” (pre N post)] revealed activity in the right anterior insula, OFC, and PAG (Fig. 5).  To identify any brain regions commonly activated in both the “Lidocaine” and “Capsaicin” conditions during pain administration, we performed four conjunction analyses (Friston et al., 2005; Nichols et al., 2005); 1) “Capsaicin” (post N pre) and “Lidocaine” (post N pre), 2) “Capsaicin” (pre N post) and “Lidocaine” (pre N post), 3) “Capsaicin” (post N pre) and “Lidocaine” (pre N post), and 4) “Capsaicin” (pre N post) and “Lidocaine” (post N pre). The null hypothesis for the Conjunction analysis is: “not all subjects/contrasts activated this pixel.” If any one of the conjunction results is signiﬁcant, the null hypothesis is rejected and we can conclude that all subjects/contrasts activated the pixel for that pair of contrasts. The threshold for each individual conjunction contrast is p b 0.005 uncorrected. A logical AND requires that all the comparisons in the conjunction are individually signiﬁcant. None of these four conjunction analyses revealed any significant activation, indicating that no common brain regions were observed between these contrasts. For exploratory purposes, we lowered the threshold to voxel-wise p b 0.05 with 50 continuous voxels. At this more liberal threshold, the results did show overlapping activity in the “Lidocaine” (pre minus post) and “Capsaicin” conditions (post minus pre) in pain-related brain regions, including the bilateral dACC (x, y, z, voxel size, peak z value: 0, 32, 12, 50 voxels, z = 2.1), left  insula/OPFC (35, 32, −40, 250 voxels, z = 2.69), and left operculum/ putamen (32, 2, 6, 70 voxels, z = 2.36).  Pre minus post in positive expectancy, negative expectancy, and no manipulation neutral conditions  To explore the fMRI signal changes under each of the different conditions, we analyzed post-treatment pain vs. pre-treatment pain in the “Capsaicin,” “Lidocaine,” and neutral conditions separately (Table 4, Fig. 6). In the “Capsaicin” condition, a pre minus post contrast revealed activation in the frontal pole. The opposite contrast in the “Capsaicin” condition (post N pre) showed activation in the bilateral insula, and right OPFC and PAG (Fig. 6). In the “Lidocaine” condition, pre minus post contrast showed activation in the bilateral ventral striatum. The post minus pre contrast revealed no brain regions activated above the threshold. In the neutral condition, post minus pre contrast indicated activation in the posterior insula, hippocampus, amygdala and precuneus. The opposite contrast revealed no signiﬁcant activation.  When we further explored the data by comparing post minus pre differences in response to identical pain stimuli in the “Capsaicin” and neutral sites [“Capsaicin” (post N pre) N neutral (post N pre)], no brain regions passed the signiﬁcance threshold. The opposite contrast [neutral (post N pre) N “Capsaicin” (post N pre)], revealed signiﬁcant brain activation differences in the bilateral amygdala, hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus (Table 5). When we subtracted the fMRI signal difference of pre-treatment from post-treatment during pain application in the “Lidocaine” condition from the same difference in the neutral condition [i.e. Lidocaine (post N pre) N neutral (post N pre)], no brain regions passed the signiﬁcance threshold. The opposite contrast revealed signiﬁcantly greater fMRI signal changes in the bilateral ventral striatum, right putamen, left vmPFC, precentral gyrus, and occipital cortex (Table 5).  Association between positive and negative expectancy-evoked brain response in pain related brain regions  To explore the within subject association between the brain response changes in the pain matrix after application of “Capsaicin,” “Lidocaine,” and neutral creams, similar to our behavioral analysis, we extracted the average beta values of all pain-sensitive brain regions (from the initial contrast as shown in Fig. 3) (Eippert et al., 2009; Wager et al., 2013) across different conditions and performed a similar analysis to the one we conducted for subjective pain rating changes.  We ﬁrst applied a Pearson correlation among the three conditions. We found a non-signiﬁcant trend for the association between “Capsaicin” and neutral conditions (r = .35, p = .093), but no other correlations approached signiﬁcance. These results are different from the results of the behavioral analysis. We also regressed the “Capsaicin” brain response to calibrated heat pain in the pain matrix on neutral and “Lidocaine” brain response changes. With neutral cream brain response in the pain matrix controlled, the partial correlation between the “Lidocaine” response and the “Capsaicin” response was 0.13 (p = .605), indicating that there is no signiﬁcant association in brain response to  Fig. 3.

These ﬁndings are also different from the results based on subjective pain rating changes.  Brain and behavior association  To explore the association between the behavioral and brain responses, we also performed a whole brain voxel-wise regression analysis between subjective pain rating differences and the corresponding brain response in positive and negative expectancy conditions separately. We found that dmPFC [x = 2, y = 32, z = 36, PFWE b 0.05, Z = 3.67] activity from the pre minus post contrast was positively correlated with self-reported pain rating reduction in the “Lidocaine” condition, i.e. stronger reduction in pain post treatment was associated with weaker activity in the dmPFC post treatment. The activity in the rostral ACC [x = 12, y = 38, z = 12; PFWE b 0.05, Z = 3.88] showed a negative correlation with the placebo effect (Fig. 7).  We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association between changes in brain  activity and changes in subjective pain ratings in other conditions.  Discussion  In the present study, using a within-subject design, we found that the application of inert “Lidocaine” cream with expectation of pain relief evoked a signiﬁcant reduction in subjective pain ratings and fMRI signal changes in the striatum, whereas inert “Capsaicin” cream with expectancy of pain enhancement evoked a signiﬁcant increase in subjective pain ratings and fMRI signal changes in the insula, OFC, and PAG. No overlapping brain regions were identiﬁed in response to both the “Capsaicin” and “Lidocaine” conditions at the threshold we set. Regression  analysis showed that after controlling for the response bias (changes in the neutral condition), the subjective pain rating changes evoked by positive and negative expectancy were signiﬁcantly associated. However, we did not observe this association in brain responses to calibrated heat pain in the regions that were activated by the pain. Our ﬁndings suggest that while self-reported placebo and nocebo responses are highly associated, this association does not exist in the corresponding brain activity changes in pain-related brain regions; positive and negative expectancies seem to engage different brain networks to modulate the experience of pain.  Independence of positive and negative expectancies in neural responses  To date, there have been many investigations concerning the placebo effect, but only a few studies have focused on within-subject responses to both placebo and nocebo effects. In one placebo analgesia study, Scott et al. (2008) asked subjects to undergo a 20-minute pain challenge and found placebo-enhanced opioid neurotransmission in the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and insular cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray, as well as dopamine activation (DA) in the ventral basal ganglia, including the nucleus accumbens. In the same study, ﬁve subjects who responded negatively to the pain challenge showed the opposite changes in brain activity: a deactivation of DA, and decreased opioid release in the brain regions mentioned above. In a more recent study, Benedetti et al. (2014) found that nocebo and placebo modulation of hypobaric hypoxia headache involves the cyclooxygenase-prostaglandins pathway, which suggests that placebo and nocebo modulation of this type of headache may share the same biochemical pathways, speciﬁcally those affected  Fig. 4.

In another study, investigators from the same group (Benedetti et al., 2006) found that a cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist counteracted noceboinduced hyperalgesia and enhanced placebo analgesia in humans. Overall, these studies suggest that some placebo and nocebo responses may arise from common brain networks.  Results from previous brain imaging studies imply that the brain mechanisms associated with placebo and nocebo may not be entirely the same. For instance, results from one of our previous studies (Kong et al., 2007) suggest that the placebo effect results mainly from topdown processing involving the emotional network, including the rostral ACC, and is mediated by reward-related genes (COMT), personality, and intrinsic resting state brain activity (Yu et al., 2014). In contrast, the nocebo effect is largely associated with the hippocampus and other anxiety-related brain regions (Gondo et al., 2012; Kong et al., 2008; Ploghaus et al., 2001). However, no study has directly compared placebo and nocebo responses in the absence of an active treatment in the same cohort of subjects.  One of the strengths of the present study is that we used a within subject design, which allowed a direct comparison of how positive and negative expectancies can modulate the subjective experience of pain. We found that both positive and negative expectancy effects were correlated with changes in reported pain intensity in the neutral  cream condition, suggesting reliable individual differences in response biases across the three conditions. With responses to the neutral cream held constant, within-subject positive expectancy responses were strongly associated with negative expectancy responses. In other words, the placebo effect was highly correlated with the nocebo effect. Our ﬁnding that the strong positive association between placebo and nocebo responses was masked by changes in the neutral condition is of methodological importance in designing future studies. Unless a natural history condition is included as a control, as was done in our study, measures of association between placebo and nocebo may be spuriously low.  Conversely, brain responses to identical calibrated heat pain in the pain matrix in the placebo and nocebo conditions controlling for the neutral cream response did not show association between positive and negative expectancies. Similarly, no overlapping brain regions were identiﬁed in the conjunction analysis between the placebo and nocebo effects at the threshold we set. At a liberal threshold of voxelwise p b 0.05 with 50 continuous voxels, we found overlapping activity in the “Lidocaine” (pre minus post) and “Capsaicin” conditions (post minus pre) in pain-related brain regions, including the bilateral dACC, left insula/OPFC, and left operculum/putamen. These ﬁndings are consistent with results from previous studies showing that activity in the insula is modulated by both positive and negative treatment  Table 4 Results of paired t-tests comparing fMRI signal change differences (post N pre and pre N post) for positive, negative and control (neutral) expectancy conditions separately.

The results suggest that despite that our observation that nocebo effects are distinct from placebo effects at the neural level, it is possible that expression of the two cognitive constructs may share some pain related brain regions as the result of context modulation.  In this study, we did not ﬁnd the same association between the brain response to calibrated heat pain in pain-related brain regions and subjective pain rating changes. We speculate that this may be due to complicated mechanisms underlying the placebo and nocebo effects. Theoretically, an inert treatment could function through three interrelated processes to produce placebo and nocebo effects (Amanzio et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2007). In the ﬁrst stage, prior to the experience of pain, the expectation or anticipation of pain relief/enhancement can modulate the perception of subsequent pain stimuli. In the second stage, during administration of painful stimuli, an inert treatment may inhibit/enhance the incoming signals of noxious stimuli. Finally, in the third stage, when the pain stimulus has ended and when subjects are required to evaluate the pain intensity, memory of previous experience/ context may subconsciously distort the decision-making process, a construct we have described as selective distortion of pain intensity evaluation (Kong et al., 2007).  Overall, placebo and nocebo effects aggregate the contribution of all three stages. The extent to which each stage contributes varies under different circumstances and by individual. Distinguishing between the aforementioned placebo and nocebo contributions under different conditions remains challenging. Since the brain responses in the painrelated brain regions to calibrated heat pain only represent the response in one stage, fMRI mainly assesses phasic, i.e. stimulus-evoked,  responses. It is quite possible that more tonic, modulatory neuronal changes are correlated between nocebo and placebo conditions. This may be the reason that the association observed in subjective pain rating cannot be observed in brain responses in the pain matrix to calibrated pain.  Positive expectancy and the reward network  Results from recent studies suggest that placebo administration with expectation of pain relief can be regarded as a speciﬁc form of reward processing that recruits activity in reward regions such as the striatum (Benedetti, 2009; de la Fuente-fernandex et al., 2002; Leknes et al., 2011; Petrovic et al., 2005; Schweinhardt et al., 2009; Scott et al., 2007). It has been shown that individual variation in ventral striatal response to reward expectation accounted for 28% of the variance in the magnitude of placebo analgesia (Scott et al., 2007). Individual differences in placebo response were signiﬁcantly associated with dopamine release under placebo and subsequent activity in reward tasks (Schweinhardt et al., 2009). One of our previous studies (Yu et al., 2014) showed that dopamine-related measurements including baseline ventral striatum coherence, functional variation in the COMT gene, and openness to experience together could predict conditioning cue responses in healthy individuals, which highlights a strong link between placebo responsiveness and brain reward processing. In the present study, after the expectancy manipulation in Session 2, participants believed that the inert “Lidocaine” cream could reduce their pain sensation. Conversely, during post-treatment pain application, this positive expectancy was eliminated as a result of very subtle pain reduction.

Our results provide further neural evidence to support a close link between nocebo and anxiety.  Previous neuroimaging studies have also shown that nocebo effects are mediated by the hippocampus and regions involved in anticipatory anxiety processing (Bingel et al., 2011; Kong et al., 2008; Ploghaus et al., 2001). In this study, we did not ﬁnd activation of the hippocampus. We speculate that this may be due to the strength of nocebo expectancy. In our previous study (Kong et al., 2008), during Session 2 (the manipulation session), we applied mild pain before administration of sham acupuncture treatment, and applied high intensity pain after sham acupuncture treatment. In this study, since both positive and negative expectancy manipulations were involved, the pre-treatment stimuli were moderate intensity and the post-treatment stimuli were high intensity. Thus, the anxiety level evoked in this study may be weaker compared to our previous experiment.  Neutral cream condition applied in a positive and negative expectancy context  It is important to note that the post minus pre contrast in the neutral condition in our study activated both the anxiety network and the reward network. This might be due to the unique design we used in which all participants experienced nocebo, neutral, and placebo conditions. In this within-subject design, the perception of a neutral condition might have been context-dependent. Previous studies have shown that outcome processing is highly sensitive to the range of possible outcomes from which the ﬁnal outcome is selected (Akitsuki et al., 2003; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005). Thus, we speculate that the neutral condition in our study was processed as nocebo if individuals used placebo as a reference.  One potential limitation of this study is that creams were colored and that this color-coding was not randomized. The colors of the creams were very light and only served to differentiate them when the containers were opened. When the creams were applied to the skin, there was no visible difference between them in terms of color. Furthermore, in Session 3 (the fMRI session), subjects could not see the cream when it was applied to their arm due to their placement in the MRI scanner. Thus, it is unlikely that observations of the colors of the creams inﬂuenced the responses of the subjects. Additionally, since we did not have an anticipation stage in our study, we were not able to explore brain networks associated with anticipation.  In conclusion, we found that positive and negative expectancies can signiﬁcantly modulate pain experience. Our behavioral results suggest that after controlling the neutral condition, the subjective pain rating changes evoked by positive and negative expectancy were signiﬁcantly associated, suggesting some common psychological/cognitive processes underlying them. However, this association was not observed in brain responses to calibrated heat pain in the pain matrix. No signiﬁcant overlap was revealed in the brain networks activated by placebo and nocebo conditions either, suggesting that positive expectancy and negative expectancy engage distinct neural networks rather than acting in opposite directions within a common network.

Brain regions showed signiﬁcant association between fMRI signal change (pre N post) and corresponding pain rating changes in positive expectancy condition. MPFC: medial prefrontal cortex; rACC: rostral anterior cingulate cortex.  This may explain why we found ventral striatum activation to be stronger in the pre-treatment “Lidocaine” condition. This result is consistent with a recent study, in which Wrobel et al. (2014) found that the ventral striatum might not be causally involved in placebo analgesia, but rather linked to phenomena associated with placebo analgesia, such as reward processing and learning.  We also found a correlation between the placebo effect and activity in the dmPFC, which is a part of the pain matrix, implicated emotion regulation (Kong et al., 2007) and pain modulation (Fields, 2000; Kong et al., 2007, 2010b, 2013). This ﬁnding suggests that the dmPFC could signal pain relief as a result of the positive expectancy effect. Furthermore, we observed a correlation with the rACC, another region involved in pain regulation, indicating that increased activity in the rACC during conditioning may be associated with a stronger placebo effect. This result is partly consistent with previous studies (Eippert et al., 2009; Wager et al., 2004) suggesting that the descending pain modulatory system is involved in placebo analgesia. Also, unlike previous studies (Eippert et al., 2009; Wager et al., 2004), which used a relatively long duration of 30 s (Eippert et al., 2009; Wager et al., 2004) and only posttreatment pain (in these studies, there is no pre-treatment pain applied, authors compared the brain responses evoked by identical pain at different spots with placebo and control creams), we used a much shorter stimulation duration of 12 s and compared pre- and post-treatment differences at different spots. We speculate that this may be the reason for this discrepancy between the present study and previous studies.  Negative expectancy response and the anxiety network  Although there are accumulating studies investigating the neural basis of positive expectancy effect, far less research is available on the negative effect. During expectation of high pain at the nocebo site, subjects are likely to feel anxious. Behavioral studies have highlighted a dominant role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in nocebo hyperalgesia via anticipatory anxiety mechanisms (Benedetti et al., 1997, 2006). Our current study shows the relevance of a wider network of regions including the insula, OFC, dmPFC, and PAG in the nocebo response. Investigators have previously shown that anxiety is associated with the functional connectivity between the amygdala and the insula (Baur et al., 2013; Shah et al., 2009; Stein et al., 2007) as well as the coupling between the amygdala and the OFC (Hahn et al., 2011; Sladky et al., 2015). The activity in the PAG and the OFC has also been often related  206  References  S.

Introduction  Background:   Early   adolescent   onset   of   substance   use   is  a  robust   predictor   of   future   substance   use  disorders. We  examined   the   relation   between   age   of   substance   use   initiation   and   resting   state   functional   connectivity   (RSFC)   of  the   core   reward   processing   (nucleus   accumbens;   NAcc)   to   cognitive   control   (prefrontal cortex;   PFC)   brain   networks. Method:   Adolescents   in   a  longitudinal   study   of   Mexican-origin   youth   reported   their   substance   use   annually  from   ages   10   to  16   years.   At   age   16,   69   adolescents   participated   in   a  resting   state   functional   magnetic resonance   imaging   scan.   Seed-based   correlational   analyses   were  conducted   using   regions   of   interest   in bilateral  NAcc. Results:  The   earlier   that   adolescents   initiated   substance   use,   the   stronger   the  connectivity   between   bilateral   NAcc   and   right   dorsolateral   PFC,   right   dorsomedial   PFC,   right   pre-supplementary   motor   area,   right inferior  parietal   lobule,   and   left   medial   temporal   gyrus. Discussion:   The   regions   that   demonstrated   signiﬁcant   positive   linear   relationships   between   the   number of  adolescent   years   using   substances   and   connectivity   with   NAcc   are   nodes   in   the   right   frontoparietal network,   which   is   central   to  cognitive   control.   The   coupling   of   reward   and   cognitive   control   networks may   be  a  mechanism   through   which   earlier   onset   of   substance   use   is  related   to   brain   function   over  time, a   trajectory   that  may   be  implicated   in   subsequent   substance   use   disorders.  ©  2015   The   Authors.

Adolescence   is  a  period  of   increased  health-risk  behavior, including  substance  use.  Adolescent  substance  use  is  common  and increases  in  prevalence  as  adolescents  move  through  high  school. National  estimates  indicate  that  20–30%  of  adolescents  have  used alcohol  or  other  drugs  by  9th  grade,  and  this  usage  increases to  50–70%  by  12th  grade  (Johnson  et  al.,  2014).  Although  some substance  use  in  adolescence  is  considered  within  the  range  of  normative  behavior,  adolescents  who  experiment  with  substance  use at  subclinical  levels  have  been  shown  to  exhibit  more  externalizing behaviors  (Ernst  et  al.,  2006a)  and  have  poorer  mental  health  and academic  outcomes  than  their  abstaining  peers  (Tucker  et  al.,  2006).  ∗ Corresponding  author  at:  Center  for  Mind  and  Brain,  267  Cousteau  Pl.,  Davis,  CA 95618,  United  States.  E-mail  address:  dgweissman@ucdavis.edu  (D.G.  Weissman).  Substance  use  early  in  adolescence  confers  heightened  risk  for  not only  substance  use  disorders  but  also  other  mental  illnesses  in  later adolescence  and  adulthood  (Brook  et  al.,  2002).  Every  year  older that  adolescents  get  before  they  initiate  substance  use,  is  thought to  decrease  the  odds  of  substance  dependence  later  in  life  by  5–15% (DuRant  et  al.,  1999;  Grant  and  Dawson,  1997,  1998).  Early  substance  use  additionally  predicts  other  types  of  health  risk  behaviors during  adolescence,  such  as  reckless  driving  and  participation  in violent  or  criminal  activities  (Grant  et  al.,  2001;  Hingson  and  Zha, 2009),  rendering  it  a  critical  health  behavior,  whose  underlying mechanisms  warrant  further  investigation.  Identiﬁcation  of  the  neurobiological  components  associated with  substance  use  behaviors  allows  for  a  richer  understanding  of the  neural  underpinnings  of  developing  substance  use  problems that  can  be  used  to  inform  treatment  targets,  whether  behavioral  and/or  pharmacological.

Weissman  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  16  (2015)  121–129  context,  and  participant  engagement  (Biswal  et  al.,  1995).  The connections  between  brain  regions  measured  by  RSFC  may   be a  function  of  direct  communication  via  structural  connections, association  with  a  third  region,  and/or  long-term  patterns  of coordinated  activity  engaged  during  certain  behaviors  or  psychological  processes.  Functional  connectivity  can  be  positive  or negative,  reﬂecting  the  direction  of  correlation  in  regional  activity  patterns  (Hulvershorn  et  al.,  2014).  The  type  of  connectivity patterns  observed  indicates  the  nature  of  the  functional  relationship  between  these  regions.  Activity  of  functionally  related  and structurally  connected  networks  of  brain  regions  are  strongly  and positively  correlated  at  rest  (Damoiseaux  et  al.,  2006;  Yeo  et  al., 2011),  whereas  networks  with  opposing  functions  demonstrate strong  negative  correlations  (Fox  et  al.,  2005).  From  childhood  to adulthood,  negative  connectivity  increases  overall  as  neural  regions become  more  specialized  and  as  the  regulatory  inﬂuence  of  regions such  as  the  prefrontal  cortex  (PFC)  gains  more  control  (Fox  et  al., 2005;  Stevens  et  al.,  2009).  The  present  study  investigates  how  variations  in  connectivity  patterns  in  the  midst  of  these  developmental shifts  relate  to  adolescent  substance  use  behavior.  Recent  work  has  documented  age-related  shifts  in  nucleus accumbens  (NAcc)  connectivity,  suggesting  that  positive  connectivity  with  anterior  cingulate  cortex  (ACC)  and  anterior  insula  peaks during  adolescence,  then  declines  into  adulthood  (Porter  et  al., 2015).  These  patterns  relate  to  conceptual  frameworks  regarding the  role  of  neurodevelopment  in  shaping  adolescents’  motivated behavior.  The  triadic  model  (Ernst  et  al.,  2006b;  Ernst  and  Fudge, 2009)  hypothesizes  that  motivated  behavior  results  from  the  balance  between  three  inﬂuences:  (1)  reward  drive,  mediated  by  the NAcc,  a  region  within  the  striatum,  (2)  harm  avoidance,  mediated by  the  amygdala,  and  (3)  regulation  of  these  systems  by  the  PFC. Research  also  points  to  the  contribution  of  salience,  emotional or  cognitive,  mediated  by  the  insula  and  ACC,  in  shaping  motivated  behavior  (Seeley  et  al.,  2007).  Different  patterns  of  functional connectivity  between  and  functional  specialization  among  regions implicated  in  reward  drive  (e.g.,  NAcc),  avoidance  (e.g.  amygdala), salience  (e.g.  insula  and  ACC),  and  the  cognitive  control  of  the  above (e.g.,  PFC)  may   therefore  differentially  help  or  hinder  adolescents’ ability  to  regulate  their  substance  use  behaviors.  Individual  differences  in  NAcc  functional  connectivity  have  previously  been  associated  with  risk  for  substance  use  problems.  In a  RSFC  study  examining  family  history  as  a  risk  factor  for  later substance  abuse,  adolescents  with  no  family  history  of  alcoholism were  found  to  have  signiﬁcant  negative  correlations  between  NAcc and  ventrolateral  PFC  (vlPFC),  suggesting  more  segregation  and functional  calibration  between  these  reward-processing  and  regulatory  regions,  respectively,  whereas  adolescents  with  a  family history  of  alcoholism  demonstrated  this  relationship  to  a  much lesser  extent  (Cservenka  et  al.,  2014).  Because  a  family  history  of substance  dependence  is  a  known  risk  factor  for  substance  use problems  (Merikangas  et  al.,  1998),  these  ﬁndings  suggest  that  a lack  of  negative  connectivity  (i.e.,  a  positive  or  zero  correlation) between  NAcc  and  regions  of  PFC  during  adolescence  may   signal risk  for  later  addiction.  Adolescent  substance  use  occurs  during  a  period  in  which  the brain  undergoes  dramatic  maturation  and  reﬁnement  of  key  neural  pathways,  particularly  in  the  structural  connections  between the  PFC  and  subcortical  circuits  (Asato  et  al.,  2010).  These  changes are  widely  thought  to  contribute  to  the  onset  of  substance  use behavior  in  adolescence  (Spear,  2000;  Steinberg,  2007;  Casey  and Jones,  2010),  and  may   make  the  development  of  the  adolescent brain  all  the  more  vulnerable  to  the  negative  effects  of  substance use  (Lubman  et  al.,  2007).  A  number  of  neuroimaging  studies have  documented  differences  in  activation  in  both  striatal,  including  NAcc,  and  PFC  regions  both  preceding  and  following  onset of  heavy  substance  use  (Clark  et  al.,  2013;  Norman  et  al.,  2011;  Tapert  et  al.,  2007;  Schweinsburg  et  al.,  2005;  Squeglia  et  al., 2009).  Behavioral  tendencies  previously  found  to  confer  risk  for  substance  use  behavior,  such  as  high  levels  of  sensation  seeking  (SS) (Zuckerman  and  Link,  1968)  may   shed  further  light  on  how  neural connectivity  patterns  relate  to  substance  use  behavior.  Increased  SS has  been  shown  to  mediate  the  relation  between  earlier  pubertal development  and  increased  substance  use  behavior  across  adolescence  (Martin  et  al.,  2002).  In  adolescents  with  a  family  history of  alcoholism,  task-related  functional  connectivity  between  NAcc and  both  supplementary  sensorimotor  area  and  precuneus  was found  to  mediate  the  positive  relationship  between  sensation  seeking  and  alcohol  consumption  (Weiland  et  al.,  2013).  This  suggests that  increasing  substance  use  rates  in  adolescence  may  result  from increased  exploratory  tendencies,  driven  by  an  increase  in  the  optimal   level  of  arousal  that  adolescents  require  to  feel  motivated  and balanced  (Ernst  et  al.,  2006b;  Ernst  and  Fudge,  2009).  While  the  NAcc  is  of  particular  interest  in  understanding  the mechanisms  underlying  adolescent  substance  use,  other  regions, particularly  the  amygdala  and  PFC  have  also  been  demonstrated to  undergo  changes  in  functional  connectivity  during  adolescence.  Across  adolescence,  negative  connectivity  has  been  found to  increase  between  dorsolateral  PFC  (dlPFC),  a  region  within networks  especially  active  during  focused  attention  and  medial PFC,  a  region  within  the  default  mode  network,  which  is  especially active  at  rest  (Chai  et  al.,  2014).  Connectivity  between  amygdala and  medial  PFC  has  also  been  shown  to  switch  from  positive  to negative  during  adolescence  (Gee  et  al.,  2013).  The  goal  of  the  present  study  was   to  examine  the  interrelations among  adolescent  substance  use,  NAcc-based  RSFC,  and  sensation seeking.  We   conducted  the  current  study  with  a  sub-sample  of Mexican-origin  adolescent  participants  drawn  from  a  multigenerational  longitudinal  study  of  the  emergence  of  substance  use and  subsequent  addiction  problems.  Latinos  are  a  rapidly  growing  segment  of  the  population,  but  are  largely  underrepresented  in psychiatric  and  neuroscience  research  (Arnett,  2008;  Chiao,  2009), despite  evidence  for  higher  rates  of  substance  use  among  Latino adolescents  (Johnson  et  al.,  2014).  Nonetheless,  the  racial  and  cultural  homogeneity  of  the  current  Mexican-origin  sample  provides an  inherent  control  for  the  inﬂuence  of  race  and  ethnicity  and  provides  data  on  an  understudied  ethnic  group  while  producing  novel results  that  should  be  generalizable  to  and  replicable  within  other populations.  Three  aims  guided  the  current  study:  (1)  to  investigate the  relation  between  age  of  substance  use  onset  and  NAcc-based RSFC,  (2)  to  examine  whether  the  relation  between  SS  and  age  of substance  use  onset  relates  to  and  potentially  mediates  any  relation  between  NAcc-based  RSFC  and  age  of  substance  use  onset  (3) to  examine  the  speciﬁcity  of  the  role  of  NAcc  in  the  above  analyses by  also  exploring  amygdala-,  and  dlPFC-based  RSFC.  2.  Materials  and  method  2.1.  Participants  Participants  were  73  Mexican-origin  adolescents  (40  female, MAge =  16.26  years,  SD  =  0.50)  enrolled  in  a  functional  neuroimaging  sub-study  of  the  California  Families  Project  (CFP),  a  10-year, prospective,  longitudinal  study  of  risk  for  and  resilience  to  substance  use  problems.  Participants  in  the  main  CFP  study  included 674  single  and  two-parent  families  of  Mexican  origin  with  a  ﬁfth grade  child  (MAge =  10.85,  50.2%  female)  who   were  drawn  at  random  from  school  rosters  of  students  during  the  2006–2007  and 2007–2008  school  years.  Participants  in  the  parent  study  were ranked  based  on  the  number  of  items  endorsed  on  the  two  substance  use  scales  at  age  15.  Participants  for  the  neuroimaging  D.G.  Weissman  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  16  (2015)  121–129   123  study  were  randomly  drawn  from  the  top  (N  =  37)  and  bottom (N  =  36)  third  of  this  distribution,  excluding  any  adolescents  taking psychotropic  medications.  Four  adolescents  were  excluded  from analyses  due  to  excessive  movement  in  the  scanner,  resulting  in  a sample  of  69  youths  for  all  reported  analyses.  2.2.  Measures  2.2.1.  Substance  use                    .  .  .  Participants  reported  their  history  of  substance  use  using  the Alcohol,  Tobacco,  and  Other  Drugs  (ATOD)  survey  (Elliott  et  al., 1982)  at  each  annual  CFP  assessment  from  ages  10–16,  as  well as  on  the  day  of  the  MRI   visit  prior  to  turning  17.  This  measure, chosen  for  its  sensitivity  to  low  to  moderate  levels  of  use,  consists of  26  items  about  participants’  respective  use  of  cigarettes,  beer, wine  or  wine  coolers,  hard  liquor,  marijuana,  inhalants,  and  other drugs  as  well  as  their  experience  with  binge  drinking,  being  drunk on  alcohol,  or  being  high  on  drugs.  For  each  of  those  substances or  experiences,  they  were  asked,  “have  you  ever. .,”  and  if  yes, .,”  and  “in  the  last  3  months, then  asked  “at  what  age  did  you  ﬁrst. how  many  times  have  you. .”   Finally,  on  the  day  of  the  MRI   visit, an  Oralert  oral  saliva  drug  test  was  used  to  assess  the  presence  of substances  within  the  preceding  few  days  (Transmetron,  Salt  Lake City,  Utah).  Participants  who  tested  positive  were  asked  if  they  were currently  under  the  inﬂuence  of  the  drug.  If  they  reported  no,  they continued  with  the  scan  (100%).  Participants’  age  of  substance  use onset,  as  shown  in  Table  1,  was  determined  based  on  when  they ﬁrst  reported  having  used  any  substance,  or  presence  of  substance was  detected  in  saliva.  This  number  was  subtracted  from  17,  participants’  maximum  age  in  years  by  the  end  of  MRI   data  collection,  to calculate  years  since  substance  use  onset.  Years  since  substance  use onset  ranged  from  0  =  never  reported  having  used  substances,  no  substances  present  at  MRI   visit  to  7  =  reported  having  used  substances  for the  ﬁrst  time  at  age  10.   Frequency  of  use  in  the  3  months  preceding the  scan  was  scored  on  a  0–4  scale  (0  =  no  use,  1  =  less  than  once  per week,  2  =  once  per  week,  3  =  two  or  three  times  per  week,  4  =  almost every  day).  Participants  also  completed  the  substance  use  disorder section  of  the  Diagnostic  Interview  Schedule  for  Children-IV  (DISC, Shaffer  et  al.,  2000)  at  each  of  the  seven  annual  visits  to  determine  lifetime  diagnosis  for  substance  abuse  and  dependence.  Four adolescents  met   criteria  for  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  abuse.  Two  met criteria  for  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  dependence.  One  met   criteria  for marijuana  abuse,  and  one  met   criteria  for  marijuana  dependence. Finally,  one  adolescent  met   criteria  for  both  marijuana  and  alcohol abuse.  2.2.2.  Demographic  characteristics  and  psychiatric  symptoms  All  adolescents  in  the  CFP  completed  the  Woodcock-Johnson  III IQ  test  (Woodcock  et  al.,  2001)  on  the  ﬁrst  visit  in  ﬁfth  grade.  Parents of  adolescents  reported  education,  income  and  household  roster  at the  ﬁrst  visit,  which  was  then  used  to  calculate  socioeconomic  status  (SES,  See  Supplementary  Materials).  Participants  self-reported on  their  pubertal  development  using  the  Pubertal  Development Scale  (Petersen  et  al.,  1983).  The  scale  consisted  of  6  items  total (4  items  for  both  boys  and  girls,  then  2  items  per  gender  that  are speciﬁc  to  their  own  gender  development).  Tanner  stage  at  age 16  was  calculated  based  on  the  average  of  these  6  items  from  the visit  in  10th  grade.  Descriptive  statistics  are  summarized  in  Table  2. Participants  self-reported  symptoms  of  attention  deﬁcit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  anxiety,  depression,  conduct  disorder,  and oppositional  deﬁance,  based  on  the  DISC,  at  each  of  visit.  Two  participants  in  the  sample  met   criteria  for  conduct  disorder  in  10th grade.  No  other  participant  met   criteria  for  any  other  psychiatric disorder  (see  Supplementary  Materials  for  descriptive  statistics  of each  psychiatric  disorder).  2.2.3.  Sensation  seeking  ˛  The  Sensation  Seeking  Scale  (Zuckerman  and  Link,  1968),  completed  on  the  day  of  the  fMRI  scan,  consists  of  four  subscales with  10  items  each.  For  each  item,  participants  chose  between two  statements  that  reﬂected  high  or  low  sensation  seeking.  The four  subscales  were:  Thrill  and  Adventure  Seeking  (e.g.,  “I  often wish  I  could  be  a  mountain  climber”  versus  “I  can’t  understand people  who  risk  their  necks  climbing  mountains.”;    =  0.61);  Disinhibition  (e.g.,  “I  like  wild,  uninhibited  parties”  versus  “I  prefer quiet  parties  with  good  conversation.”;    =  0.77);  Experience  Seeking  (e.g.,  “people  should  dress  in  individual  ways,  even  if  the  effects are  sometimes  strange”  versus  “people  should  dress  according  to some  standard  of  taste,  neatness,  and  style”;    =  0.47);  and  Boredom  Susceptibility  (e.g.,  “I  can’t  stand  watching  a  movie  I’ve  seen before”  versus  “there  are  some  movies  I  enjoy  seeing  a  second  or even  a  third  time”;    =  0.56).  The  Disinhibition  subscale  contains  3 items  that  speciﬁcally  refer  to  substance  use  (e.g.,  “I  have  tried  marijuana  or  would  like  to”  versus  “I  would  never  smoke  marijuana”; ˛   =  0.69).  All  analyses  involving  the  total  SS  and  Disinhibition  scales were  conducted  both  with  (˛   =  0.67)  these substance-related  items.    =  0.77)  and  without  (˛  ˛  ˛  ˛  2.3.  Resting  state  fMRI  2.3.1.  Resting  state  scan  Participants  were  instructed  to  lie  still  and  relax  in  the  scanner for  several  minutes  with  their  eyes  opened  and  focused  on  a  white ﬁxation  cross  presented  on  a  black  screen  through  a  mirror  attached to  the  head  coil.  Resting  state  fMRI  data  were  collected  for  7  min 24  s.  2.3.2.  Image  acquisition  and  data  preprocessing  for   ×   3.5   The  scan  was  conducted  on  a  Siemens  3T  TIM  Trio  MRI scanner  with  a  32-channel  head  coil.  Parameters  image × acquisition  were  voxel  size  =  3.5    3.5  mm,   slices  =  35,  slice thickness  =  3.5  mm,   repetition  time  =  2000  ms,  echo  time  =  27  ms, ﬂip  angle  =  80  degrees,  interleaved  slice  geometry,  ﬁeld  of view  =  224  mm.   Images  were  T2  weighted.  The  ﬁrst  three  volumes were  discarded  to  ensure  magnet  stabilization.  Preprocessing  was conducted  using  the  FMRIB  Software  Library  (FSL)  (Smith  et  al., 2004)  and  Analysis  of  Functional  NeuroImaging  (AFNI)  software (Cox,  1996).  Preprocessing  consisted  of  slice  timing  correction, rigid  body  motion  correction  with  six  degrees  of  freedom,  and spatial  smoothing  with  a  6  mm  half-maximum  Gaussian  kernel. “Denoising”  of  the  data  was   accomplished  through  independent  component  analysis  using  FSL’s  MELODIC,  with  components rated  as  either  signal  or  noise  using  criteria  for  visual  inspection described  by  Kelly  et  al.  (2010).  The  noise  components  were  then ﬁltered  out  of  the  functional  data.  Each  participant’s  functional data  were  then  co-registered  with  their  brain-extracted  structural images  and  normalized  to  Montreal  Neurological  Institute  (MNI) stereotaxic  space  using  FSL’s  two-stage  registration  method  via FLIRT.  Alignment  was   visually  conﬁrmed  for  all  participants.  AFNI was  then  used  for  de-spiking,  band-pass  ﬁltering  above  0.1  Hz  and below  0.01  Hz,  and  censoring  of  volumes  with  head  motion  greater than  0.3  mm  from  the  previous  volume,  resulting  in  the  aforementioned  exclusion  of  four  participants  for  whom  censoring  resulted in  the  removal  of  more  than  44/220  volumes  (i.e.,  20%  of  the  data). As  such,  69  participants  were  included  in  the  analyses.  2.3.3.  Data  analysis  A  region  of  interest  (ROI)  based  on  bilateral  spheres  with  a  radius of  3.5  mm  each  was   created  at  the  locations  of  the  left  and  right −8)  based  on  prior  work NAcc  (MNI  coordinates:  x  =  (Di  Martino  et  al.,  2008).

Individual  spherical  ROIs  with  a  radius of  6  mm  were  created  at  the  location  of  left  and  right  dlPFC  (MNI ±40,  y  =  40,  z  =  24).  Correct  alignment  of  ROIs  was coordinates:  x  =  conﬁrmed  for  each  participant  by  visual  inspection.  The  average time  course  of  the  voxels  in  each  ROI  was  extracted  using  AFNI’s 3dmaskave  and  correlated  with  every  voxel  in  the  brain  for  each participant  using  AFNI’s  3dﬁm+.  These  correlation  coefﬁcients  were transformed  using  Fisher’s  z  transformation.  More  positive  values in  the  resulting  z-score  for  each  voxel  indicate  more  similarity between  the  BOLD  time  course  of  the  ROI  and  that  voxel,  while more  negative  values  indicate  anticorrelation  between  the  BOLD time  courses.  Based  on  AFNI’s  3dClustSim  program,  which  uses  Monte  Carlo simulations  to  determine  appropriate  cluster  sizes,  accounting  for the  number  of  voxels  and  a  6  mm  smoothing  kernel,  a  voxel-wise threshold  of  t  =  3.433,  p  =  0.001,  and  a  minimum  cluster  size  of  45 voxels  produced  an  overall  alpha  <0.01.  Regression  analysis  was conducted  using  AFNI’s  3dttest++  to  determine  the  effect  of  years since  substance  use  onset  on  the  z-transformed  correlation  maps representing  connectivity  for  each  ROI  for  each  participant.  3.  Results  3.1.  Associations  of  substance  use  onset  age  with  other  variables of  interest  Pearson  correlations  were  calculated  between  age  of  substance use  onset,  age  at  scan,  gender,  pubertal  status,  IQ,  SES,  self-reported substance  use  frequency  concurrent  to  the  scan,  lifetime  symptoms of  psychiatric  disorders,  and  sensation  seeking  subscales.  As  shown in  Table  3,  years  since  substance  use  onset  was  not  signiﬁcantly correlated  with  age,  gender,  pubertal  status  at  age  16,  IQ,  or  SES. Therefore,  these  variables  were  not  included  as  covariates  in  the resting  state  analysis.  Years  since  substance  use  onset  was   significantly  correlated  with  conduct  disorder  symptoms,  oppositional deﬁance  symptoms,  ADHD  symptoms,  and  depression  symptoms  (see  Supplementary  Materials).  Years  since  substance  use  onset  signiﬁcantly  correlated  with  the  Thrill  and  Adventure  seeking  subscale of  SS  and  to  a  greater  extent  with  the  Disinhibition  subscale  score.  3.2.  Years  since  substance  use  onset  and  RSFC  Five  regions  demonstrated  a  signiﬁcant  positive  relation between  the  number  of  years  since  age  10  that  adolescents  had engaged  in  substance  use  and  the  strength  of  connectivity  with  the NAcc.  As  shown  in  Table  4  and  Fig.  1,  the  earlier  that  adolescents initiated  substance  use,  the  more  positive  the  connectivity  between bilateral  NAcc  and  right  pre-supplementary  motor  area  (pre-SMA), right  dorsolateral  PFC  (dlPFC),  right  dorsomedial  PFC  (dmPFC), right  inferior  parietal  lobule  (IPL),  and  left  medial  temporal  gyrus (MTG).  These  clusters  remained  signiﬁcant  when  conducting  separate  analyses  excluding  participants  who  had  tested  positive  for marijuana  in  saliva,  and  excluding  participants  who  met   subclinical criteria  for  conduct  disorder.  As  shown  in  Table  5,  six  regions  demonstrated  a  signiﬁcant  relation  between  the  number  of  years  since  age  10  that  adolescents had  engaged  in  substance  use  and  the  strength  of  connectivity with  the  right  dlPFC.  Examining  the  overall  connectivity  of  these regions  with  right  dlPFC,  independent  of  substance  use,  revealed that  three  clusters  had  overall  negative  connectivity  with  right dlPFC,  and  three  clusters  had  overall  positive  connectivity  with right  dlPFC.  Right  ACC,  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex,  and  right dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  had  overall  negative  connectivity with  right  dlPFC,  but  the  connectivity  was  less  negative  the  earlier that  adolescents  initiated  substance  use.  Two  clusters  in  right  and left  dlPFC  and  another  in  the  right  lingual  gyrus  demonstrated  overall  positive  connectivity  with  right  dlPFC,  and  the  connectivity  was more  positive  the  earlier  that  adolescents  initiated  substance  use. In  addition,  a  single  cluster  in  right  ACC  demonstrated  signiﬁcantly less  negative  connectivity  with  left  dlPFC  the  younger  adolescents were  when  they  ﬁrst  engaged  in  substance  use.  D.G.

In  contrast  to  results  for  the  NAcc  and  dlPFC  seeds,  no  regions demonstrated  signiﬁcant  relations  between  age  of  substance  use onset  and  connectivity  with  the  amygdala  seed.  There  was  no  signiﬁcant  relation  between  substance  use  frequency  concurrent  with  the  fMRI  scan  and  NAcc  connectivity.  Thus, there  was  no  justiﬁcation  for  investigating  whether  RSFC  differences  related  to  substance  use  frequency  could  explain  the  relation between  RSFC  and  number  of  years  using  substances.  Neither  overall  SS  nor  Disinhibition  demonstrated  a  signiﬁcant relation  to  NAcc  RSFC.  Thus,  there  was  no  justiﬁcation  for  investigating  whether  RSFC  differences  related  to  SS  could  explain  the relation  between  number  of  years  using  substances  and  RSFC.  Due to  the  lack  of  a  relation  between  amygdala  RSFC  and  substance  use, amygdala  RSFC  was  not  investigated  with  regard  to  SS.  4.  Discussion  This  study  was  designed  to  determine  the  relation  between the  age  of  substance  use  onset  across  early  to  middle  adolescence and  the  intrinsic  connections  of  the  brain’s  reward  circuitry.  A robust  and  consistent  relation  was  observed,  such  that  the  earlier adolescents  initiated  substance  use,  the  greater  the  coordinated  activity  of  bilateral  NAcc  and  ﬁve  neural  regions:  right  pre-SMA, right  dlPFC,  right  dmPFC,  right  IPL,  and  left  MTG.  This  pattern is  striking  in  both  expected  and  novel  ways.  First,  the  relations between  NAcc  connectivity  with  each  of  the  ﬁve  other  regions  and years  since  substance  use  onset  were  consistent,  whereby  a  linear  increase  in  NAcc  connectivity  with  these  regions  corresponded with  every  year  earlier  that  the  adolescents  initiated  substance use.  Second,  these  right  hemisphere  regions  have  been  shown  in previous  research  to  be  strongly  connected  to  one  another  both functionally  and  structurally,  and  to  be  primary  nodes  in  what  has commonly  been  called  the  right  fronto-parietal  control  network (Fassbender  et  al.,  2006;  Seeley  et  al.,  2007;  Nindam  et  al.,  2012). Co-activation  of  the  regions  in  this  network  has  been  observed in  resting  state  studies  (Damoiseaux  et  al.,  2006;  Spreng  et  al., 2013)  as  well  as  during  performance  of  a  variety  of  tasks  requiring  cognitive  control  (Fassbender  et  al.,  2006;  Seeley  et  al.,  2007). Right  dlPFC  and  right  IPL  in  particular  have  been  implicated  as  the common  brain  regions  involved  in  a  wide  range  of  executive  functions  requiring  top-down  attentional  control  (Fassbender  et  al., 2006).  They  are  therefore  considered  to  constitute  a  network  of intrinsically  connected  regions  that  generally  subserve  cognitive control.  126   D.G.

Points  on  the  scatter  plots  depict  the  Z-transformed  correlations  of  the  voxel  time  courses  within  each  signiﬁcant  cluster  with  the  NAcc  time  course,  averaged  across the   voxels  in  each  cluster,  and  plotted  against  years  since  age  10  of  substance  use  onset  for  each  participant.  B  =  Regression  coefﬁcient  for  the  relation  between  years  since onset  of  use  and  NAcc-Cluster  connectivity,  R  Pre-SMA/dlPFC  =  Right  pre-supplementary  motor  area,  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex;  R  IPL  =  Right  inferior  parietal  lobule;  R dmPFC   =  Right  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex;  R  dlPFC  =  Right  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex,  L  MTG   =  Left  middle  temporal  gyrus.  Our  results  suggest  that  earlier  onset  of  substance  use  relates to  greater  integration  of  striatal  and  right  frontoparietal  networks, and  thereby  a  stronger  coupling  of  the  brain’s  reward  and  cognitive control  mechanisms.  This  increased  between-network  coupling may  not  be  speciﬁc  to  reward  and  cognitive  control  networks, however.  More  years  of  substance  use  was  also  associated  with increased  connectivity  between  dlPFC  and  several  regions  within prefrontal  cortex,  a  pattern  that  runs  counter  to  the  developmental  trajectory  typically  seen  across  adolescence  toward  more segregation  of  neural  networks  that  underpin  opposing  or  complementary  functions  (Chai  et  al.,  2014;  Fox  et  al.,  2005;  Stevens  et  al.,  2009).  The  patterns  of  increased  interconnectivity  between dlPFC  and  other  prefrontal  regions,  particularly  ACC,  are  strikingly similar  to  those  found  in  cocaine-dependent  adults  (Camchong et  al.,  2011;  Cisler  et  al.,  2013).  This  suggests  that  a  lack  of segregation  between  cognitive  control  regions  and  other  brain networks  may   be  related  to  the  duration  of  substance  exposure and  risk  for  future  substance  use  problems.  Finally,  amygdala  did not  show  any  signiﬁcant  connectivity  with  any  other  regions, lending  support  to  the  speciﬁcity  of  reward  processing  and  cognitive  control  circuitry  connections  to  the  adolescent  substance  use phenotype.  D.G.  Weissman  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  16  (2015)  121–129   127  Increased  coupling  between  reward  and  cognitive  control regions  is  consistent  with  research  demonstrating  that  monetary  incentives  improved  performance  and  increased  activation in  frontoparietal  control  networks  during  cognitive  control  tasks for  adolescents  with  substance  use  disorder,  relative  to  healthy controls  (Chung  et  al.,  2011).  A  stronger  coupling  of  reward  and  cognitive  control  networks  may   suggest  a  strong  inﬂuence  of  external appetitive  motivators  on  goal-directed  neural  activity.  Alternatively,  increased  connectivity  between  NAcc  and  the  frontoparietal network  may   represent  a  compensatory  mechanism  by  which those  that  have  longer  lifetime  use  of  substances  recruit  normative levels  of  cognitive  control  behavior  when  required.  Greater  connectivity  between  NAcc  and  the  right  frontoparietal  network  does  not  appear  to  be  a  neural  signature  of  sensation seeking.  Although  strongly  correlated  with  the  number  of  years since  substance  use  onset,  neither  Sensation  Seeking  nor  Disinhibition  was  associated  with  NAcc-based  RSFC;  thus,  NAcc-based RSFC  could  not  mediate  the  link  between  SS  and  earlier  adolescent substance  use.  SS  is  by  no  means  an  exhaustive  measure  of  the  psychosocial  tendencies  that  predispose  adolescents  to  early  substance use  onset,  and  previous  studies  have  failed  to  ﬁnd  a  connection between  SS  and  neurodevelopmental  trajectories  in  adolescence thought  to  underlie  risk-taking  (Mills  et  al.,  2014).  Nonetheless, these  ﬁndings  suggest  that  NAcc  functional  connectivity  with the  right  frontoparietal  control  network  is  related  to  adolescent substance  use  behavior,  irrespective  of  its  association  with  a  preexisting  tendency  to  pursue  rewards.  A  more  likely  explanation may   therefore  be  that  substance  use  during  adolescence  engages NAcc  and  the  right  frontoparietal  network  in  tandem,  perhaps  especially  as  behavior  is  regulated  toward  the  pursuit  of  rewards  such as  substances,  and  the  earlier  that  substance  use  takes  place,  the stronger  the  coactivations  become.  This  connectivity  pattern  may therefore  be  one  mechanism  by  which  early  adolescent  substance use  alters  brain  function  and  contributes  to  the  development  of substance  use  disorders.  Some  important  limitations  must  be  considered  in  interpreting the  current  ﬁndings.  First,  the  single  time-point  of  fMRI  data  collection  leaves  the  direction  of  causality  undetermined.  Structural  and functional  differences  in  the  brains  of  adolescent  substance  users have  been  identiﬁed  both  before  and  after  the  initiation  of  substance  use  (Squeglia  et  al.,  2009).  It  is  unknown  from  the  present study’s  results  whether  differences  in  connectivity  preceded  and contributed  to  earlier  substance  use,  or  vice  versa.  To  address  this issue,  longitudinal  study  of  adolescents’  neurodevelopment  and substance  use  into  adulthood  is  essential.  These  efforts  should  also assess  other  psychosocial  tendencies  and  behaviors  related  to  substance  use  and  risk-taking  as  potential  mediators  of  brain-behavior relationships  in  order  to  more  rigorously  characterize  the  nature of  their  causal  relationship.  In  fact,  the  participants  in  this  study will  continue  to  be  followed  annually,  and  data  on  their  substance use  behavior  and  psychosocial  tendencies  will  be  collected  into adulthood.  Second,  although  the  use  of  MNI   standard  space,  based  on  adult brains,  is  common  practice  in  studies  of  adolescent  brain  function (Stevens  et  al.,  2009;  Cservenka  et  al.,  2014;  Chung  et  al.,  2011), and  we  visually  conﬁrmed  localization  of  all  ROI  seeds,  the  appropriateness  of  using  the  adult  brain  to  normalize  and  locate  ROIs on  adolescent  brains  remains  open  to  debate  (Muzik  et  al.,  2000). Future  research  might  create  and  employ  the  use  of  a  template based  on  the  adolescent  brain  to  study  substance  use  in  adolescent samples.  Third,  despite  there  being  a  wide  range  of  substances,  substances  were  treated  as  a  general  category  in  connectivity  analyses. Given  the  high  degree  of  overlap  in  substance  usage  and  the  small number  of  adolescents  engaging  in  the  use  of  substances  other  than alcohol  and  marijuana,  the  present  study  was  underpowered  to  test  for  NAcc-based  RSFC  differences  related  to  speciﬁc  drugs,  which should  be  addressed  in  future  work.  Moreover,  future  researchers should  note  the  comorbidity  of  alcohol  and  marijuana  use  when investigating  the  speciﬁc  effects  of  either  substance.  Furthermore,  our  measure  of  age  of  onset  suggests  different  time windows  over  which  participants  had  engaged  in  substance  use. This  was  found  to  more  strongly  relate  to  NAcc-based  RSFC  than concurrent  frequency  of  use.  However,  other  approaches  to  operationalizing  substance  use  across  all  these  years  could  contribute to  variations  in  the  consequences  for  neural  functioning.  Further investigations  could  attempt  to  identify  particular  developmental windows  in  which  onset,  duration,  and  frequency  of  use  may   be differentially  inﬂuential  on  neural  functioning.  The  current  study  suggests  other  new  avenues  for  future  work. First,  the  right  lateralization  of  these  functional  connectivity  patterns  for  the  NAcc  seed  as  well  as  the  more  profuse  prefrontal interconnectivity  differences  for  the  right  versus  the  left  dlPFC  seed raise  questions  for  future  investigation.  Although  left  and  right frontoparietal  control  networks  frequently  demonstrate  coactivity during  cognitive  control  (Seeley  et  al.,  2007;  Niendam  et  al.,  2012), the  right  and  left  frontoparietal  control  networks  have  also  been found  to  be  dissociable  functional  networks  (Damoiseaux  et  al., 2006;  Yeo  et  al.,  2011;  Spreng  et  al.,  2013).  It  is  unclear  what  it is  about  adolescent  substance  use  that  would  speciﬁcally  promote greater  connectivity  with  the  right,  and  not  the  left,  frontoparietal  control  network.  Further  research  is  necessary  to  investigate the  functional  speciﬁcity  of  these  regions,  their  connectivity  with striatum,  and  their  relation  to  substance  use.  A  growing  body  of  research  connects  aberrant  RSFC  with  adolescent  psychopathology,  including  anxiety  symptoms  and  disorders (Burghy  et  al.,  2012;  Roy  et  al.,  2013),  depression  (Cullen  et  al., 2009),  attention-deﬁcit/hyperactive  disorder  (Sripada  et  al.,  2014), and  now,  with  the  present  study,  substance  use.  With  continued investigation  and  replication,  RSFC  shows  promise  as  a  method for  identifying  the  mechanisms  by  which  early  adolescent  substance  use  may   lead  to  later  substance  abuse  and  dependence, and  as  a  unique  indicator  of  risk,  with  the  potential  to  reﬂect underlying  genetic  and  developmental  variability  in  neurotransmission.  Indeed,  NAcc-PFC  RSFC  has  been  linked  with  genotypic differences  impacting  dopamine  neurotransmission  (Gordon  et  al., 2015,  2012),  an  increase  in  which  is  thought  to  lead  to  increased incentive  motivation  in  adolescence  (Luciana  et  al.,  2012).  As  such, examining  RSFC  as  an  endophenotype  may   be  applied  to  future work  focused  on  understanding  risk  from  genotype  to  phenotype. Incorporating  a  multi-level  perspective  on  the  genetic  and  neurobiological  contributors  to  the  development  of  substance  use  disorders into  translational  efforts  has  the  potential  to  lead  to  transformative prevention  and  intervention  efforts.  5.  Conclusion  The  earlier  substance  use  was  initiated  in  adolescence,  the stronger  the  coupling  between  NAcc  and  brain  regions  that  make  up the  right  frontoparietal  network,  a  network  known  to  be  involved in  cognitive  control,  as  well  as  increased  interconnectivity  between dlPFC  and  other  PFC  regions.  These  patterns  occurred  independently  of  the  equally  strong  relations  between  the  age  of  substance use  onset  and  disinhibition,  and  age  of  substance  use  onset  and  substance  use  frequency.  Because  of  the  strong  connection  between age  of  substance  use  onset  and  later  substance  abuse  and  dependence,  these  ﬁndings  suggest  that  connectivity  between  reward  and cognitive  control  networks  may   serve  as  a  mechanism  inﬂuencing  the  transition  to  substance  abuse  and  dependence.  This  study demonstrates  the  utility  of  seed-based  resting  state  functional  connectivity  analyses  in  improving  our  understanding  of  variations  128   D.G.  Weissman  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  16  (2015)  121–129  in  neural  functioning  that  underlie  psychiatric  illness,  indicating its  burgeoning  potential  in  the  identiﬁcation  of  risk  and  targeted intervention.

However, despite the importance of these ER strategies, previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have not sufﬁciently disentangled the speciﬁc neural impact of REAP versus ESUP on brain responses to different kinds of emotion-eliciting events. Moreover, although different effects have been reported for stimulus valence (positive vs. negative), no study has systematically investigated how ER may change emotional processing as a function of particular stimulus content variables (i.e., social vs. nonsocial). Our fMRI study directly compared brain activation to visual scenes during the use of different ER strategies, relative to a “natural” viewing condition, but also examined the effects of ER as a function of the social versus nonsocial content of scenes, in addition to their negative versus positive valence (by manipulating these factors orthogonally in a 2× 2 factorial design). Our data revealed that several prefrontal cortical areas were differentially recruited during either REAP or ESUP, independent of the valence and content of images. In addition, selective modulations by either REAP or ESUP were found depending on the negative valence of scenes (medial fusiform gyrus, anterior insula, dmPFC), and on their nonsocial (middle insula) or social (bilateral amygdala, mPFC, posterior cingulate) signiﬁcance. Furthermore, we observed a signiﬁcant lateralization in the amygdala for the effect of the two different ER strategies, with a predominant modulation by REAP on the left side but by ESUP on the right side. Taken together, these results do not only highlight the distributed nature of neural changes induced by ER, but also reveal the speciﬁc impact of different strategies (REAP or ESUP), and the speciﬁc sites implicated by different dimensions of emotional information (social or negative).  © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, besides being inﬂuenced by emotions in our actions, we in turn have the ability to modulate our emotional responses by different mechanisms. The importance of emotion regulation (ER) capacities can be observed in various domains or situations, either in terms of increasing pos Abbreviations: BASE, baseline; CON, control; ER, emotion regulation; ESUP, expressive suppression; INST, viewing instruction; INT, intensity; NAT, natural viewing; NEG, negative; NSN, nonsocial negative; NSOC, nonsocial; NSP, nonsocial positive; PLN, pleasantness; POS, positive; REAP, re-appraisal; SC, social content; SN, social negative; SOC, social; SP, social positive; VAL, valence. ∗ Corresponding author at: Swiss Center for Affective Sciences, 7 rue des Battoirs, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland.

Uncovering the neural mechanisms that can regulate affect and their inﬂuence on the processing of emotionally signiﬁcant information is therefore of great importance, not only to gain insight into the determinants of well-being and adaptive emotional processing, but also to better understand the predispositions to affective disorders and the effect of speciﬁc therapeutic interventions.  Behavioral research on ER (Gross, 1998) has highlighted two major kinds of ER strategies, which are conceptualized to have their impact at distinct stages during emotion processing.  On the one hand, cognitive reappraisal (REAP) is thought to intervene at a relatively early stage of emotion processing by modulating the meaning of an emotional event. This typically involves the intentional (conscious) generation of alternative interpretations in response to an event, allowing one to modify (e.g., minimize)  1068  P. Vrtiˇcka et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 1067–1082  its emotional signiﬁcance. Accordingly, REAP has been shown to alter subjective emotion experience (as measured by physiological arousal and verbal reports) to both negative and positive emotional stimuli, and for both up- and down-regulation of affect (Kim & Hamann, 2007). Moreover, studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during REAP have shown increased activity in a widespread network of cortical frontal regions, together with simultaneous decreases in areas critical for emotion elicitation, such as the amygdala, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and insula (Goldin, McRae, Ramel, & Gross, 2008; Kim & Hamann, 2007; Ochsner, Bunge, Gross, & Gabrieli, 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). On the other hand, suppression of behavioral expression (ESUP) is thought to operate only after emotion elicitation, and is directed towards the inhibition of emotional responses (e.g., facial expressions or physiological changes). Thus, the triggering event is typically appraised and elicits an emotion, but the overt behavioral manifestations are voluntarily suppressed. Unlike REAP, ESUP has been found to increase sympathetic activation, to produce little effect on negative emotion experience, and to even decrease positive affect and interfere with cognitive processes such as memory (Gross, 1998; Richards & Gross, 2000). Although brain imaging data on ESUP are still scarce, one study has reported an increase in prefrontal cortical activity during ESUP of negative emotions (either sadness or disgust; (Goldin et al., 2008). The same investigation also found increased amygdala and insula responses during ESUP, but only in a late period of prolonged exposure to disgusting ﬁlm-clips, contrasting with the decreases observed in these regions during REAP (Kim & Hamann, 2007; Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). Finally, whereas the use of REAP has been linked to enhanced control of emotion, better interpersonal functioning, and higher psychological and physical well-being, the frequent use of ESUP is thought to result in diminished control of emotion, worse interpersonal functioning, and greater risks for depression (Gross & John, 2003).  Despite the fact that our knowledge regarding the neural correlates of ER has steadily increased during the last decade, several important issues still remain largely unresolved. Firstly, most of the previous brain imaging studies on ER have investigated only one type of ER strategy at a time (Beauregard, Levesque, & Bourgouin, 2001; Kim & Hamann, 2007; Koenigsberg et al., 2010; Levesque et al., 2003; Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004), except for one study (Goldin et al., 2008) that compared REAP and ESUP in a single experimental design but focused on difference in the time-course of ER effects. Hence, still very little is known about the differential impact of REAP and ESUP on brain activity during emotional processing, particularly in relation to different stimulus types. This does not only concern cortical brain areas exerting top-down control during ER, predominantly located within prefrontal cortex, where a functional segregation between behavioral (ESUP) and cognitive (REAP) control has already been suggested (Goldin et al., 2008); but also the lower-level areas in sensory cortices and subcortical regions that are crucially involved in emotional responses, such as the amygdala, striatum, or insula. Thus, it still remains to be elucidated whether insula activity during downregulation of affect only decreases through REAP but increases during ESUP, as would be predicted by ER theory (Gross, 1998; Gross & John, 2003), or whether it can also be down-regulated during ESUP just like during REAP. Therefore, in our study, we examined both cognitive (REAP) as well as behavioral (ESUP) strategies of ER, in addition to a “natural” emotion experience condition (NAT; see Section 2) that served as a baseline condition.  Secondly, most previous fMRI experiments on ER only differentiated modulatory effects as a function of the valence (VAL; positive vs. negative) and/or arousal values (low vs. high intensity) attributed to emotional stimuli (Kim & Hamann, 2007; Mak, Hu, Zhang, Xiao, & Lee, 2009), but did not consider other important  aspects of the latter, such as their social versus nonsocial features. One exception is a recent investigation by Koenigsberg and colleagues where the authors used social negative images exclusively in a cognitive re-evaluation (REAP) paradigm (Koenigsberg et al., 2010). Yet, this study did not compare brain activations elicited by social negative to comparable nonsocial negative scenes. This lack of systematic investigation of ER as a function of the content of emotion-eliciting stimuli is regrettable given many other ﬁndings which point to major differences in emotional reactions (and their corresponding neural signatures) depending on the social versus nonsocial nature of information (Britton et al., 2006; Frewen et al., 2010; Goossens et al., 2009; Hariri, Tessitore, Mattay, Fera, & Weinberger, 2002; Norris, Chen, Zhu, Small, & Cacioppo, 2004; Sander, Koenig, Georgieff, Terra, & Franck, 2005; Scharpf, Wendt, Lotze, & Hamm, 2010). In addition, there is evidence that the activation of some limbic brain areas (e.g., the amygdala) is more sensitive to social and thus interpersonal aspects rather than to nonsocial dimensions of emotion-eliciting situations (Killgore & YurgelunTodd, 2005; Vrtiˇcka, Andersson, Grandjean, Sander, & Vuilleumier, 2008). Likewise, the medial prefrontal cortex has also been linked with both emotion recognition and social cognition (Gilbert et al., 2007; Lane & McRae, 2004; Mitchell, Macrae, & Banaji, 2006; Peelen, Atkinson, & Vuilleumier, 2010). These differences in social and emotional content are likely to imply different mechanisms for successful ER strategies. As a consequence, in our study, emotional images were systematically varied according to both their affective valence (VAL: positive vs. negative) and their social content (SC: social vs. nonsocial), as separate experimental factors in a 2× 2 design.  To this aim, our study used a systematic approach combining whole-brain imaging with analysis of functionally deﬁned regions of interest (ROIs) while participants were instructed to apply different ER strategies for different stimulus types. In previous work, activation differences related to ER have typically been derived from comparisons between REAP versus baseline or ESUP versus baseline, and this for a single emotional dimension (i.e., negative stimuli) (Goldin et al., 2008; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). To our knowledge, only two imaging studies so far also compared the relative differences in brain responses to positive versus negative images during ER (Kim & Hamann, 2007; Mak et al., 2009). Here, we set out to identify brain areas that were not only involved in processing a speciﬁc stimulus attribute (i.e., VAL or SC), but also signiﬁcantly modulated by the different ER instructions (INST; either NAT, REAP, or ESUP). Therefore, we speciﬁcally tested for regions showing a signiﬁcant INST× VAL or INST× SC interaction. To restrain our analysis to regions showing reliable effects of interest but ensure sufﬁcient sensitivity across the different conditions, we ﬁrst used a whole-brain random-effects (RFX) analysis to determine functional networks whose activity was signiﬁcantly modulated by either VAL or SC, and then computed an additional second-level RFX analysis (using a paired t-test design in SPM) to identify voxels within these networks that displayed signiﬁcant effects due to the different ER strategies (see Section 2). This approach allowed us to deﬁne regions of interest (ROIs) where the processing of speciﬁc affective cues (VAL or SC) was selectively modulated by the different kinds of ER.  We predicted changes in activations related to the differential encoding of valence (negative vs. positive) and/or stimulus content (social vs. nonsocial) in brain networks that are selectively tuned to social and affective information (Lieberman, 2007), including in particular the amygdala which has previously been shown to be sensitive to social cues (Britton et al., 2006; Frewen et al., 2010; Goossens et al., 2009; Hariri et al., 2002; Norris et al., 2004; Sander et al., 2005; Scharpf et al., 2010; Vrtiˇcka et al., 2008) and modulated by different ER strategies (Killgore & Yurgelun-Todd, 2005; Kim & Hamann, 2007; Koenigsberg et al., 2010; Levesque et al.,  P. Vrtiˇcka et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 1067–1082  1069  2003; Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). Other differences were expected in prefrontal cortical areas that have been implicated in controlling emotion processing during different ER strategies (Goldin et al., 2008; Kim & Hamann, 2007; Levesque et al., 2003; Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004).  2. Methods  2.1. Subjects  We recruited 19 healthy paid volunteers (all right-handed women, mean age 24.82± 4.0), who all had a normal or corrected to normal vision, no history of neurological or psychiatric disease, and gave informed written consent according to the local ethical committee regulation. Only women were included because of evidence that emotions are typically more intense and more prone to regulation in women (e.g., Fujita, Diener, & Sandvik, 1991), but also to increase comparability with previous emotion regulation studies that also included women only (Kim & Hamann, 2007) and to avoid any potential sex differences that could have modulated the regulation effects of interest. We did not record information about their menstrual cycle (see Limitations).  2.2. Experimental material and procedure  2.2.1. Stimuli  A total number of 360 emotional pictures were initially chosen either from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) or from the internet. All were in colors, and adjusted to obtain similar size, contrast, and pixel resolution. Half of the pictures displayed scenes with a clear social content, such as two people ﬁghting or a mother interacting with her baby. The other half represented objects or landscapes (nonsocial), like a dead bird in industrial waste or a tropical island scene.  All 360 pictures were rated in a separate behavioral study (Vrtiˇcka et al., under revision) by 54 female students on three continuous rating scales (from 0 to 100), including PLEASANTNESS (PLN; from very negative to very positive), INTENSITY (INT; from low to high arousal), and CONTROL (CON; from absence to full presence of possible control over the emotional situation). According to the average rating results from this sample, 240 pictures were ﬁnally chosen for the fMRI study, and sorted by their SOCIAL CONTENT (SC; either social or nonsocial) and VALENCE (VAL; either positive or negative). This gave rise to four stimulus categories (60 pictures each): Social Positive (SP) or Negative (NSP), and Nonsocial Positive (NSP) or Negative (NSN). The ﬁnal distribution of pictures in these four categories as a function of emotional rating scores (PLN, INT, and CON) showed that NEG images had signiﬁcantly lower pleasantness scores as compared to POS images [PLNNEG = 20.67± 6.02 and PLNPOS = 72.14± 10.19; F(1,59) = 3919.25, p < .001], but also higher intensity [INTNEG = 70.08± 8.05 and INTPOS = 44.06± 7.14; F(1,59) = 1554.01, p < .001] and lower control [CONNEG = 35.91± 8.14 and CONPOS = 55.49± 9.25; F(1,59) = 452.97, p < .001] scores. However, most importantly, there were no signiﬁcant differences for all three rating scales between SOC versus NSOC images [PLNNSOC = 46.68± 26.41 and PLNSOC = 46.91± 27.46; INTNSOC = 57.17± 14.46 and INTSOC = 57.91± 14.01; CONNSOC = 45.53± 11.96 and CONSOC = 46.63± 13.00; Fs(1,59) < 1.36, ps > .25], and no signiﬁcant VAL× SC interactions [Fs(1,59) < 2.65, ps > .11] (as shown by a 2 [VAL]× 2 [SC] repeated-measure analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Note that the differences in intensity between negative and positive stimuli could not be avoided in order to match pairs of social and nonsocial scenes in both valence conditions, because social material is otherwise typically judged as much more intense than nonsocial material (Ewbank, Barnard, Croucher, Ramponi, & Calder, 2009). Finally, we also selected 40 neutral images from the IAPS database (20 including humans, 20 without humans) to be used in a baseline control condition (see below), with average valence ratings of 49.7± 1.7 (on the same scale of 1–100). The ﬁnal experimental set of emotional images showed no differences in luminance across categories [Fs < 2.83; ps > .098 in a 2 (VAL)× 2 (SC) repeated-measure ANOVA], and all social images were comparable in terms of the average number of people depicted per image [complexity measure; SP versus SN: F(1,59) = .468; p = .497].  2.2.2. Experimental conditions  Before entering the fMRI scanner, all participants were told that the purpose of the experiment would be to investigate how the brain reacts to different types of images (e.g., real scenes, TV or movie scenes) and to which degree people can voluntarily inﬂuence the emotional impact of these images. Accordingly, the experimental layout comprised four different viewing instructions (INST), in which pictures were presented with different tasks to induce different emotion regulation strategies.  The ﬁrst INST served a control baseline (BASE), and was introduced to the participants as “a photographic quality” judgment, where they had to indicate on each trial (by button press, using a 4-point scale—see below) whether the image was of good quality (e.g., well focused or properly lighted). All images in this condition were neutral, but could display either scenes with humans (i.e., social content) or inanimate settings and landscapes (i.e., nonsocial content). This viewing condition was later used to provide a baseline for general differences in brain activation to social vs. nonsocial stimuli, irrespective of emotional processing demands and valence. It  Fig. 1. Illustration of the within-block event-related fMRI paradigm. Each block for each viewing condition began with an instruction slide (7 s), followed by a series of pictures. Each picture was shown for 2 s, preceded by a central ﬁxation cross (jittered between 790 and 1485 ms), and followed by an emotional rating display (4 s). Stimulus type (social vs. nonsocial, negative vs. positive) was pseudo-randomized within each ot the different regulation condition blocks.  was presented as the ﬁrst block of the ﬁrst scanning run and the last block of the last run.  The three other INST constituted the main experimental design and included emotional images only. To assess brain responses during “natural” or spontaneous emotion experience (NAT), participants were asked to watch and evaluate the depicted emotional scenarios as if they corresponded to real situations to which the participants would be personally exposed. To assess the effect of cognitive reevaluation (RE-APPRAISAL instruction; REAP), participants were instructed to view the depicted emotional scenes as parts of a movie clip or TV show that displayed fake or artiﬁcially set-up situations created to give rise to emotions. The latter strategy (“pretend unreal”) has been one of the most often used in order to down-regulate emotional reactions to negative and positive images (Kim & Hamann, 2007). Finally, to assess the effect of behavioral inhibition of emotional expression (EXPRESSIVE SUPPRESSION instruction; ESUP), the participants were told to watch the pictures similarly to the NAT condition, but with the important difference that they were instructed not to display any felt emotions that could become visible on the outside (e.g., through breathing frequency, heart rate, skin conductance responses, and facial expression—which were told to the participant to be recorded via electrodes attached to the body and an eye-tracker camera). After each picture, participants were shown a rating display and asked to report the feeling state evoked by the preceding stimulus (“How did you feel while seeing the last image”?), using a 4-point scale (see below).  All emotional images were counterbalanced across participants, so that the same images seen in one INST condition by a given subject were seen in the other INST conditions by different subjects.  2.2.3. Procedure  The fMRI experiment was divided into three successive scanning runs. Each run included two of the three INST conditions, presented in blocks of 40 emotional images (duration = 294 s per block), whereas the ﬁrst and the last run also included an additional block of 20 neutral images (BASE, duration = 151 s). Within each block, images were pseudo-randomized and equally probable for the different stimulus categories (social vs. nonsocial content, positive vs. negative valence). Hence participants could not anticipate an image from a given category. The ﬁrst and the third runs lasted approximately 13 min, and the middle run 10 min.  Each block began with an INST display (7 s), followed by images in pseudorandomized order. Every individual trial started with a ﬁxation cross at the screen center (average duration = 1125 ms jittered between 790 and 1485 ms), followed by an emotional or neutral image for 2 s, and then a response display probing for emotion ratings (4 s; see Fig. 1). This brief presentation enabled us to focus on stimulus-drive responses, while the same emotion regulation strategy could be employed in a sustained manner throughout each block. While many studies on ER have use longer stimulus duration and manipulated the strategy instructions in randomly mixed succession, here we chose a blocked design for the different instruction conditions, allowing us to obtain a stable task-set over successive stimuli and avoid any prolonged carry-over effects of emotions from one scene to the next (Pitroda, Angstadt, McCloskey, Coccaro, & Phan, 2008; Richiardi, Eryilmaz, Schwartz, Vuilleumier, & Van De Ville, 2010).  Ratings were made on a 4-button response box, according to a 4-point scale ranging from very and slightly negative (buttons 1 and 2, respectively), to slightly and very positive (buttons 3 and 4, respectively). This 4-point scale does not allow for strictly neutral values, but forced participants to make emotional judgments and was previously found to provide reliable emotion discrimination measures (e.g., Peelen et al., 2010).  1070  2.2.4. MRI acquisition  P. Vrtiˇcka et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 1067–1082  MRI data were acquired on a 3 T whole-body INTERA system (Philips Medical Systems), using standard head-coil conﬁguration. For each participant, a structural image was obtained with a MPRAGE T1-weighted sequence (TR/TE/Flip = 2200 ms/30 ms/85◦, parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) with acceleration factor 2, FOV = 235 mm× 235 mm, matrix = 128× 84, resulting voxel size is 2.8× 1.8× 3.4 mm3). Functional images (TI/TR/TE/ﬂip = 900/1900/2.32/9◦, parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) with acceleration factor 2, FOV = 230× 230× 173 mm3, Matrix = 256× 246× 192) covered the whole brain, composed of 36 contiguous 4 mm axial slices parallel to the inferior edge of the occipital and temporal lobes, and acquired continuously for a total of 975 images per participant (two sessions with 350 and one session with 275 images). Image quality was veriﬁed to exclude prominent signal drop-out in orbitofrontal and mediotemporal areas.  Image processing was performed with SPM2 (www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk) using standard procedures for realignment of the time-series, slice-timing correction, normalization to a standard brain template in MNI space, and smoothing with an 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Statistical analysis was performed using the general linear model implemented in SPM2, with a separate regressor for each event type convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Twelve event types from the emotion regulation task (4 image categories: SP, NSP, SN and NSN; for each of the three INST: NAT, REAP, and ESUP), plus two additional event types (social and non-social) from the baseline condition (BASE) were modeled for each participant as separate regressors, using the three scanning runs in a ﬁxed-effect analysis at the single-subject level. Movement parameters from realignment corrections were entered as additional covariates of no interest for each scanning run, in order to account for residual movement artifacts after realignment. Statistical parametric maps were then generated from linear contrasts between the different conditions in each participant.  A ﬁrst second-stage random-effect (RFX) analysis was performed using onesample t-tests on contrast images obtained in each subject for each comparison of interest. All contrasts were performed across the whole brain using standard threshold criteria (Worsley et al., 1996) of signiﬁcant activation at a voxel-level of p < .001 uncorrected (except for bilateral amygdala, p < .005 given a priori predictions), and a cluster size greater than 5 voxels (135 mm3). Average parameter estimates of activity (betas) for each condition were extracted from all voxels in regions of interest (ROIs), deﬁned by the full-extent clusters showing signiﬁcant activation at a voxel level of p < .001 (T-value > 3.61; except for bilateral amygdala: p < .005, T-value > 2.88) in the SPM group analysis (random-effect contrasts). These beta values were then used for subsidiary repeated-measure ANOVAs and t-tests performed in SPSS with the factors of stimulus content, valence, and viewing condition, when appropriate.  Additional whole-brain RFX contrasts were also performed to reveal regions that showed differential responses to SOC versus NSOC and/or POS versus NEG images (and vice versa) as a function of the viewing conditions (e.g., [NATSOC − NATNSOC] > [REAPSOC − REAPNSOC]), and thus identify the selective effect of different emotion regulation strategies on different aspects of stimulus content (i.e., stimulus× viewing condition interactions). These comparisons were made using a stepwise paired t-test procedure applied to second-stage contrasts, as previously described elsewhere (Lazar, Luna, Sweeney, & Eddy, 2002; Ritchey, Dolcos, & Cabeza, 2008), which allowed us to assess speciﬁc non-crossed interactions between the factors of interest (unlike unconstrained interaction tests in SPM that typically probe for the two sides of an interaction in a single whole-brain contrast). Thus, the paired t-tests between relevant contrasts (e.g., NAT vs. REAP) were ﬁrst inclusively masked with the SOC versus NSOC contrast or POS versus NEG contrast (at p < .025), and vice versa (to ensure that the interactions concerned the ROIs found to activate in the main effects of our initial RFX analysis), and then thresholded using a T-value > 3.61 (p < .001), and a cluster size of k > 10 voxels [270 mm3]. Even though probabilities may not be completely independent, this procedure results in an effective statistical signiﬁcance that approaches the joint probability estimate of p < .000625 (Lazar et al., 2002; Ritchey et al., 2008), which is more stringent than the conventional statistical threshold of p < .001 at the voxel level.  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral data  During fMRI scanning, participants rated their emotional feeling in response to each picture on a four point scale (from very negative to very positive, see Section 2). These rating scores conﬁrmed that positive images were signiﬁcantly more pleasant and negative images less pleasant than neutral images, across all viewing conditions [average = 3.28± .17, 2.43± .21, and 1.52± .15 for positive, neutral, and negative, respectively; all pairwise comparisons t≥ 14.44, p≤ .001]. This difference was found regardless of stimulus categories [main effect of VAL, F(1,18) > 6.24, p < .001], without any effect of the social content for any of the emotional conditions [SP vs. NSP: t(18) < 1.84, SN vs. NSN: t(18) < 1.47, ps > .05, paired  Fig. 2. Behavioral rating results. Subjects rated each image on a 4 point scale (from −2 and −1 for very and slightly negative, to +1 and +2 for slightly and very positive, respectively). While there was a clear main effect of picture valence, emotion regulation effects were stronger during REAP than during ESUP and signiﬁcant (relative to NAT) for all four stimulus categories during REAP [p < .001], but only for POS stimuli [p < .020], not NEG stimuli [p > .17], during SUP.

More critically, however, the emotional rating of pictures was signiﬁcantly modulated by the INST conditions induced by the different ER tasks (even though pictures were counterbalanced across participants and equally presented in each condition). As compared with the NAT condition, ER was successfully achieved during both REAP and ESUP conditions, leading to less intense emotional rating scores for all four stimulus categories during REAP [t(18) > 4.35, p < .001], and for POS stimuli during ESUP [t(18) > 2.56, p < .020]. There was no signiﬁcant difference for NEG stimuli in the latter condition: t(18) < 1.45, p > .17]. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, the effects of REAP on emotional ratings were stronger than those of ESUP for all four picture categories [paired t-tests, ts(18) > 2.72, ps < .014). This pattern is consistent with predictions that REAP is a more efﬁcient regulation strategy than ESUP.  3.2.  fMRI data  The main aim of our study was to orthogonally vary ER (represented by INST) and stimulus content to test for any speciﬁc interactions within the whole brain. To achieve this goal, we ﬁrst computed the main effects (Section 3.3 below) of scene content (SOC > NSOC, and vice versa; Section 3.3.1 and Fig. 3) and emotional valence (POS > NEG, and vice versa; Section 3.3.2 and Fig. 4), across all INST. Because only one study so far directly compared REAP and ESUP strategies (Goldin et al., 2008), we then also contrasted these two instruction conditions (REAP > ESUP, and vice versa; Section 3.3.3 and Fig. 5), across all picture types. All ﬁndings are summarized in Tables 1–3.  More critically, in a second step, we performed a random-effect SPM analysis using a stepwise t-test design on speciﬁc contrasts of interest (see Section 2), allowing us to test for the differential effects of each instruction condition as a function of emotional valence (INST× VAL interaction; Section 3.4.1) and social content (INST× SC interaction; Section 3.4.2) of scenes. Parameters of activity (betas) were then extracted from each region showing such interactions in the whole-brain analysis, and submitted to a full 3 (INST)× 2 (VAL)× 2 (SC) repeated-measure ANOVA to identify the speciﬁc sources of interaction. All ﬁndings for signiﬁcant effects are summarized in Table 4.  P. Vrtiˇcka et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 1067–1082  1071  Fig. 4. Main effects of valence.

Abbreviations: dmPFC = dorso-medial prefrontal cortex, pSTS = posterior superior temporal sulcus, scACC = subcallosal ACC, mFG = medial fusiform gyrus. Note that when compared to the neutral control condition, both negative and positive stimuli produced strong and overlapping activations in several brain regions bilaterally, including medial orbitofrontal cortex, rostro-ventral ACC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior anterior temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporo-parietal junction. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.)  3.3.3. Comparison of re-appraisal versus suppression  Of greater interest for the current study were the speciﬁc activations related to different ER strategies. Distinct clusters were identiﬁed in right prefrontal cortex (PFC) for the direct comparison REAP > ESUP (which activated the anterior part of the superior frontal gyrus [SFG] and posterior part of the middle frontal gyrus [MFG]; see Fig. 5a and Table 3), and for the comparison ESUP > REAP (which activated superior frontal sulcus and supplementary motor area [SMA]; see Fig. 5d and Table 3). For both PFC clusters found to activate during REAP (Fig. 5a), we conducted further statistical tests using a full 3 (INST)× 2 (VAL)× 2 (SC) repeated-measure ANOVA on beta values extracted from activated voxels (in SPSS, see Section 2). This analysis conﬁrmed a main effect of INST [Fs(1,18) > 6.09, ps < .005], which was due to signiﬁcant increases during REAP relative to ESUP [ts(18) > 5.86, ps < .001], and to a lesser extent during NAT relative to ESUP [ts(18)≥ 2.24 ps < .038]. However, in both clusters, only the REAP condition produced signiﬁcant increases as compared with the neutral baseline condition [BASE; ts(18) > 2.32, ps < .032] (Fig. 5b). Moreover, in the posterior right MFG cluster (xyz = 39 24 54), there was a signiﬁcant SC× VAL interaction during REAP [F(1,18) = 6.51, p = .02], indicating that this activation was predominantly driven by the social negative (SN) image category, with a signiﬁcant effect of picture content for negative [SN > NSN, t(18) = 2.62, p = .017], but not positive [Sp > NSP; t(18) = .0443, p = .97] images. In the SFG, there was also a marginally signiﬁcant SC× VAL interaction [p = .08], but no main effects of SC [p≥ .14] in pairwise comparisons. Conversely, for the right superior frontal sulcus cluster activated during ESUP (Fig. 5b and Table 3), a 3× 2× 2 repeated measure ANOVA on beta values conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant main effect of INST [F = (1,18) = 9.42, p = .001], reﬂecting a marked difference between ESUP and REAP [t(18) = 5.07, p < .001]. Moreover, only ESUP showed signiﬁcant increases as compared with the neutral baseline [BASE; t(18) = 3.16, p = .005] (Fig. 5e). Finally, for the right supplementary motor area (SMA; Fig. 5c and Table 3), a similar  Fig. 3. Main effects of scene content.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.)  3.3. Main effects  3.3.1. Comparison of social and nonsocial pictures  As expected, social scenes produced greater activation in widespread brain networks including extrastriate visual cortex, temporal lobe, and ventromedial prefrontal areas, all previously associated with face and body perception, person recognition, mentalizing, and/or social cognition (Britton et al., 2006; Goossens et al., 2009; Harris, McClure, van den Bos, Cohen, & Fiske, 2007; Norris et al., 2004; van den Bos, McClure, Harris, Fiske, & Cohen, 2007). Conversely, nonsocial scenes produced greater activation in visual regions associated with object and place recognition, as well as insula, anterior cingulate, and more lateral areas in prefrontal cortex (see Table 1 and Fig. 3).  3.3.2. Comparison of negative and positive pictures  Negative images (compared to positive) increased activity mainly in right insula, prefrontal and parietal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate, and extrastriate visual cortex, all brain areas known to be involved in arousal, attention, and object recognition (Critchley, Melmed, Featherstone, Mathias, & Dolan, 2002; Kim & Hamann, 2007; Vuilleumier, Armony, Driver, & Dolan, 2001; Vuilleumier, Richardson, Armony, Driver, & Dolan, 2004). Positive images produced greater activation in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and occipital regions (see Table 2 and Fig. 4).  1072  P.

Moreover, both ESUP and NAT showed signiﬁcant increases relative to BASE [ts(18) > 2.38, ps≤ .028] (Fig. 5f). No effect or interaction involving SC was found in these two clusters. In all these regions, the repeated-measure ANOVAs showed no main effects of VAL [Fs(1,18)≤ .09, ps≥ .76] and no other interactions.  3.4. Selective regulation effects in different stimulus conditions 3.4.1. Regulation as a function of valence (INST× VAL interactions)  No brain areas that responded to POS > NEG images were found to display different effects as a function of INST. By con trast, however, three brain regions that responded to NEG > POS images showed signiﬁcant differences between regulation conditions (INST× VAL interaction), as described below. The dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, xyz =−3 33 51, Brodman area 8, see Fig. 6a and Table 4) was signiﬁcantly activated in the critical interaction test comparing the natural viewing condition NAT to REAP (i.e., [NATNEG − NATPOS] > [REAPNEG − REAPPOS]). A subsequent 3 (INST)× 2 (VAL)× 2 (SC) ANOVA on beta values from this cluster conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant INST× VAL interaction [F(1,18) = 4.89, p = .023] (see Fig. 6d), and post hoc comparisons showed that it was due to a lack of increases to negative scenes during REAP [NEG > POS, t = 1.95, n.s.], unlike the increases seen in the other two conditions [ts(18)≥ 3.33, ps≤ .004]. Thus, the magnitude of the negative valence effect (activation difference between NEG vs. POS images) was signiﬁcantly reduced during REAP relative to both NAT [t(18) = 2.96, p = .008] and to ESUP [t(18) = 2.04, p = .057];  Table 2 Brain areas activated for the comparison between positive and negative emotional image categories.

An ANOVA for each VAL condition separately conﬁrmed that this pattern was produced by a selective modulation of responses to NEG scenes, as indicated by a main effect of INST for NEG [F(1,18) = 3.96, p = .029] but not POS pictures [F(1,18) = .22, p = .80]. In addition, the full 3× 2× 2 ANOVA also indicated a clear main effect of VAL [NEG > POS; F(1,18) = 24.35, p < .001], but no effect of SC [SOC > NSOC; F(1,18) = .365, p = .553] and no other interaction [VCON× SC: F(1,18) = 3.02, p = .10]. A second cluster in the medial fusiform/lingual gyrus (mFG/LG, xyz =−24 −66 −9) showed a similar interaction effect between VAL and INST (see Fig. 6b and Table 4). The full 3× 2× 2 ANOVA on beta values also conﬁrmed an interaction of INST× VAL [F(1,18) > 5.16, p < .011] (see Fig. 6e), while post hoc comparisons indicated that it was due to a reduced VAL effect (difference between NEG vs. POS images) during REAP as compared with NAT [all t(18) > 3.21, ps < .005], but also during ESUP as compared with NAT [Fig. 6c,  yellow peak; t(18) = 3.25, p = .004]. Moreover, an ANOVA for each VAL condition again indicated that these changes were selective for the NEG images (main effect of INST: [F(1,18) > 6.76, p < .003]). There were no such effects for POS images (main effect of INST: F(1,18) = .587). In addition, the 3× 2× 2 ANOVA showed main effects of both the VAL [NEG > POS; F(1,18) > 33.52, p < .001] and SC [NSOC > SOC; F(1,18) > 27.06, p < .001] of pictures, but no other interactions [VCON× SC: Fs(1,18) < 1.43, ps > .25]. The third activation was found in the right anterior insula (aINS; xyz = 36 27 −3; see Fig. 6c [yellow cluster] and Table 4). A significant INST× VAL interaction was conﬁrmed by the full 3× 2× 2 ANOVA on beta values [F(1,18) > 4.76, p < .015], reﬂecting a decrease of the VAL effect (difference between NEG vs. POS images) during both REAP [t(18) > 2, p < .05] and ESUP [t(18) > 2.1, p < .05; paired t-tests], relative to NAT (see Fig. 6f). Additional ANOVAs and pairwise comparisons again showed that these effects were speciﬁc to NEG scenes [main effect of INST: F(1,18) > 5.47, p < .008]; whereas  Table 3 Brain areas activated for the direct comparison between the two different Emotion Regulation Strategies.

An additional main effect of VAL [NEG > POS; Fs(1,18) > 46.6, ps < .001] was also present, with only a marginal main effect of SC [NSOC > SOC; Fs(1,18) < 3.42, ps > .081], but no other interactions [INST× SC: Fs(1,18) < 1.92, ps > .16].  Taken together, these results indicate that both REAP and ESUP had an impact on responses to negative scenes in the insula and medial fusiform/lingual gyrus, whereas in addition REAP produced a selective reduction of responses to negative scenes in the dorsomedial PFC. No difference in the impact of ER strategies was observed for positive scenes. Only the medial fusiform/lingual gyrus was differentially sensitive to nonsocial content (presumably reﬂecting the predominance of objects (Pourtois, Schwartz, Spiridon, Martuzzi, & Vuilleumier, 2009) and places (Haxby et al., 2001) in these images (see above), but this factor did not interact with the valence condition. 3.4.2. Regulation as a function of social content (INST× SC interactions) For brain regions showing responses to NSOC > SOC images, a differential effect of each regulation task (INST× SC interaction) was found in the right middle insula (see Fig. 7a and Table 4). An interaction effect was also observed in the mid-dorsal cingulate and left prefrontal cortex, but primarily driven by relative changes in the response to SOC images (data not shown), rather than to NSOC images. Therefore, only data from the right middle insula (mINS) were further analyzed.  This right mINS cluster (Fig. 7a) showed a selective activation to nonsocial emotional scenes that was signiﬁcantly reduced during ESUP relative to the other INST (i.e., [NATNSOC –NATSOC] > [ESUPNSOC − ESUPSOC], yellow cluster in Fig. 5). This INST× SC interaction was conﬁrmed by a full 3× 2× 2 repeatedmeasures ANOVAs on extracted beta values [F(1,18) = 7.40, p = .002], and observed because the relative activation difference between NSOC versus SOC images was selectively abolished during ESUP as compared to both NAT [peak xyz = 39 12 −3; t(18) = 3.99, p = .001; Fig. 7b, red cluster] and REAP conditions [peak xyz = 51 −3 −3; t(18) = 2.45, p = .025; Fig. 7b, yellow cluster]. Additional ANOVAs and pairwise comparisons revealed that only responses to NSOC images were signiﬁcantly modulated by INST [red cluster:  main effect of INST: F(1,18) = 7.57, p = .002]. There was no signiﬁcant modulation for SOC images [main effect of INST: Fs(1,18) < 2.0 ps > .15  Finally,  in addition to a main effect of SC [NSOC > SOC: Fs(1,18) > 17.55, ps < .001], the full repeated-measure ANOVA on betas from the right mINS revealed main effects of VAL [NEG > POS; Fs(1,18) > 19.78, ps < .001] and INST [Fs(1,18) > 5.11, ps < .01], but there was no INST× VAL interaction [Fs(1,18) < .38, ps > .69]. For the opposite contrast SOC > NSOC, we observed different effects between each of the regulation conditions (INST× SC interaction) in several cortical brain areas as well as in the amygdala. First, two distinct clusters were found in the medial PFC (xyz = 3 54 21) and medial OFC (xyz = 6 54 −14) when comparing REAP to NAT or to ESUP (Fig. 8a, red and yellow voxels, respectively; see Table 4). The repeated-measure ANOVAs on extracted betas conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant INST× SC interaction [Fs(1,18) > 6.65, ps≤ .004] for both clusters, which was driven by the fact that the relative activation to SOC vs. NSOC images was signiﬁcantly reduced during REAP [ts(18) > 3.42, ps < .003] and to a lesser extent during ESUP [ts(18) > 2.11, ps≤ .049] as compared to NAT. There was no effect when comparing REAP with ESUP [ts(18) < 1.81, ps≥ .10] (Fig. 8c). Additional ANOVAs and pairwise comparisons conﬁrmed that INST modulated the neural response to SOC images only [main effect of INST: Fs(1,18) > 5.29, ps < .01]; but no reliable modulation was found for NSOC images [main effect of INST: Fs(1,18) < 3.24, ps > .06;. For both the mPFC and mOFC, there was also a clear main effect of SC [SOC > NSOC, Fs(1,18) > 36.12, ps < .001], but no other interaction [INST× VAL, Fs(1,18) < 1.74, ps > .19]. A second effect was found in the posterior cingulate cortex (xyz = 0 −51 33, Fig. 8b and Table 4): The ANOVA on extracted beta values also revealed a highly signiﬁcant INST× SC interaction [F(1,18) = 10.71, p < .001, and F(1,18) = 8.18, p = .001, respectively for red and yellow voxels in Fig. 8b]. This interaction reﬂected a reduced activation to SOC versus NSOC images during REAP as compared with both NAT [red: t(18) = 5.54, p < .001; yellow: t(18) = 3.76, p = .001] and ESUP [red: t(18) = 3.22, p = .005; yellow: t(1,18) = 4.44, p < .001], but not for ESUP as compared to NAT [all t(18)≤ 1.22, ps≥ .38] (Fig. 8d). Additional ANOVAs and pairwise comparisons conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of this modulation for SOC images [main effect of INST: Fs(1,18) > 6.54, ps < .004]. Except  P.

Lastly, an interaction was found in bilateral Amygdala (see Fig. 9ac and Table 4), but with a different pattern of effects for each regulation condition on each side. In the left amygdala, a signiﬁcant INST× SC interaction emerged [F(1,18) = 6.19, p = .005, red] because the relative activation for SOC > NSOC scenes was abolished during REAP [SOC > NSOC, t(18) = 1.76, n.s.] and thus signiﬁcantly differed from the activation for SOC > NSOC during NAT [t(18) = 3.46, p = .003]. This preferential amygdala response to SOC scenes still persisted in the ESUP condition [SOC > NSOC, t = 2.81, p = .012], even though activity was globally reduced and also slightly lower in this condition as compared to NAT [t(18) = 2.27, p = .04] (see Fig. 9c). Importantly, these modulations were speciﬁc for SOC images, as demonstrated by separate ANOVAs showing a signiﬁcant main effect of INST for SOC [F(1,18) = 4.68, p = .016], but not for NSOC stimuli [F(1,18) = .675, p = .456]. In the right amygdala (Fig. 9b), however, a signiﬁcant INST× SC interaction [F(1,18) = 6.41, p = .004, yellow] was found because the  activation for SOC > NSOC scenes was selectively abolished during ESUP [t(18) = .61, n.s.]. This differed from the signiﬁcant increase to SOC stimuli seen during both NAT [t(18) = 3.32, p = .004] and REAP [t(18) = 2.64, p = .017]. Additional ANOVAS also revealed a selective effect of INST on responses to SOC images [F(1,18) = 3.38, p = .05], but no effect for NSOC images [F(1,18) = .50, p = .61], and no other interactions (see Fig. 9d). To verify this hemispheric asymmetry between left and right amygdala, we computed an additional 2 (SIDE)× 3 (INST)× 2 (VAL)× 2 (SC) repeated-measure ANOVA, which revealed a signiﬁcant triple interaction between SIDE× INST× SC [F(1,18) = 5.05, p = .012]. This triple interaction was driven by two factors: Firstly, the activation difference between SOC versus NSOC images showed a signiﬁcant decrease during REAP as compared with NAT in the left amygdala only [left: t(18) = 3.46, p = .003; right: t(18) = 1.16, p = .26], leading to a marginally signiﬁcant 2 (SIDE)× 2 (INST) interaction [F(1,18) = 3.60, p = .072]. Secondly, the activation difference between SOC versus NSOC images showed a signiﬁcant decrease during ESUP as compared to REAP in the right amygdala only [right: t(18) = 2.64, p = .017; left: t(18) = 1.35, p = .193], leading to a signiﬁcant 2 (SIDE)× 2 (INST) interaction [F(1,18) = 9.85, p = .006].  1076  P.

Discussion  The current fMRI study aimed at differentiating the impact of emotion regulation strategies on activity in limbic and cortical brain areas as a function of the nature of affective cues, i.e., when  Fig. 9.

Parameter estimates (beta values) extracted from the (c) left and (d) right amygdala clusters, averaged across voxels and participants, show different regulation effects in each hemisphere. The left amygdala displayed a selective elimination of differential responses to social (vs. non-social) images during REAP only. Conversely, the right amygdala exhibited a selective elimination of the social content effect during SUP only. This pattern led to a signiﬁcant three-way interaction of hemisphere× scene content× regulation condition (see text). All values are displayed relative to neutral baseline (BASE), with ±1 S.E.M.

Vrtiˇcka et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 1067–1082  related to social (SOC) versus nonsocial (NSOC) information and when associated with negative (NEG) versus positive (POS) valence. To this aim, ER using either reappraisal (REAP) or expressive suppression (ESUP) strategies were systematically compared with a natural viewing condition (NAT) across different stimulus content conditions.  4.1. Behavioral results  Subjective ratings of visual scenes during fMRI scanning indicated that REAP was more efﬁcient than ESUP in modulating emotion experience intensity, for all types of scenes (see Fig. 2). This pattern is consistent with previous data on the volitional control of emotions, particularly in response to negative stimuli (Goldin et al., 2008; Gross, 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). By contrast, ESUP produced a signiﬁcant reduction of emotion intensity ratings for POS scenes only (not NEG scenes). However, the social content (SC) of stimuli had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on subjective emotion experience, as evidenced by similar effects of REAP and ESUP on the rating scores for both social and nonsocial emotional scenes. This different impact of the two ER conditions accords with the notion that the ESUP strategy primarily regulates the behavioral expression of emotions but not the experienced feelings (Gross, 1998). It is also possible that the lack of effect of ESUP on the ratings of negative stimuli reﬂected their higher arousal values relative to the positive stimuli (see Section 2), although this difference had no such effect in the REAP condition. Because social stimuli typically tend to be judged as more arousing than nonsocial stimuli (Ewbank et al., 2009), we could not totally match emotion intensity between positive and negative scenes in order to obtain similar valence values for the more crucial comparisons of social and nonsocial content. Thus, social and nonsocial images were well matched on arousal (and control) judgments, and showed similar changes in subjective ratings across the different ER conditions. Nevertheless, despite this similarity in ratings, our fMRI results revealed speciﬁc effects of ER on the response of several brain areas as a function of the different content of emotional scenes. These results therefore point to speciﬁc neural sites where emotional processing can be modiﬁed by ER (e.g., in limbic and sensory areas), in addition to the possible neural sources where modulatory inﬂuences are presumably generated (e.g., in prefrontal cortices).  4.2. Prefrontal cortical regions as a putative source of emotion regulation  By directly contrasting brain activation in the two ER conditions with each other (REAP > ESUP and ESUP > REAP), irrespective of stimulus type, we identiﬁed a set of regions in the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) whose activity was differentially increased either during REAP (superior and middle frontal gyrus; SFG and MFG, respectively) or during ESUP (superior frontal sulcus and supplementary motor area; SFS and SMA, respectively; see Fig. 5). These regions showed no main effects or interactions due to the VAL or SC of scenes. Thus, activity in these regions depended on the nature of the ER strategy but not on the nature of emotional information to be regulated (except for MFG that was more activated by negative social scenes than other pictures). This pattern suggests a general role of the right PFC in processes subserving ER, rather than in the representation of emotional information per se. Anatomically, these activations accord with previous studies describing increased activity in dorsolateral PFC during cognitive up- and down-regulation of both positive and negative emotions (Goldin et al., 2008; Kim & Hamann, 2007; Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004), as well as during behavioral suppression of negative affect (Goldin et al., 2008; Levesque et al., 2003). Such activations are thought to subserve the maintenance of appraisal  instructions or scripts used to re-interpret stimuli, as well as the resistance to interference by emotionally salient inputs, implicating in particular the SFG (Kim & Hamann, 2007; Ochsner et al., 2002), in addition to behavioral inhibition and voluntary suppression of bodily expressions, implicating more inferior frontal areas in SFS and lateral OFC (Levesque et al., 2003). Several regions in right dorsolateral PFC have also been involved in controlling task-set or stimulus–response mapping in various conditions, suggesting that this region is generally involved in the regulation and control of behavior (Brass, Derrfuss, Forstmann, & von Cramon, 2005). On the other hand, activation in the SMA was similarly increased during ESUP and natural viewing (NAT), relative to both the neutral baseline condition and REAP. This is consistent with a role of medial prefrontal areas in the planning and monitoring of affective motor behavior (Morecraft, Stilwell-Morecraft, & Rossing, 2004), which might operate during both ESUP and NAT but not when emotion experience was diminished by REAP (as indicated by subjective ratings).  Thus, our data provide new evidence for a functional anatomical segregation within PFC, including regions more speciﬁcally implicated in REAP (SFG and MFG) and others implicated in ESUP (SFS and SMA). These functions could be distinguished independently of any difference in their temporal dynamics as postulated in a previous study comparing REAP and ESUP (Goldin et al., 2008). In the latter study, brain regions associated with different ER strategies were primarily determined by imputing early responses after stimulus onset to REAP, while later responses after stimulus onset were ascribed to ESUP. Here, because ER was applied in a block-design, we could not reliably compare the time-course of stimulus-evoked responses in the different viewing conditions.  Even though there were no main effects of VAL or SC in right PFC, the MFG was the only area that displayed some degree of stimulusrelated speciﬁcity during REAP. Signal changes in right MFG during REAP showed a selective social versus nonsocial effect for negative but not positive images, implying that its activity was the highest for SN information. These ﬁndings suggest that the downregulation of negative emotion during REAP may require more cognitive processing or more effort for social as opposed to nonsocial stimuli, presumably because negative social information has a stronger intrinsic relevance for affect and behavior than nonsocial features (Hariri et al., 2002).  It should be noted that overall, the differences in activity representing the neural sources of regulation were less widespread in the present study, as compared with previous studies on ER. One possible reason for this could be the blocked presentation of ER instructions in our study, which ensured a stable task-set and allowed us to asses event-related responses to brief emotional stimuli, contrary to many prior studies where participants had to deploy a different ER strategy on each trial and stimuli were therefore presented for longer duration (e.g., Kim & Hamann, 2007; Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). Such a design is likely to induce greater modulations of prefrontal regions with sustained activity related to top-down control, as opposed to sensory-driven regions involved in bottom-up perceptual processing. Another possibility is that in many other studies, instructions for the “natural” condition required participants to simply “look” at the pictures (Kim & Hamann, 2007; Koenigsberg et al., 2010; Mak et al., 2009; Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004), whereas we also asked participants to imagine that the situation could be experienced in reality, which may imply a ﬁrst person perspective with personal involvement. Thus, our NAT conditions could actually have led to up-regulation attempts, which were treated as a different ER condition in some studies (e.g., “increase” strategy, see Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). Because emotion up- and downregulation may engage partly similar prefrontal areas, some effects could therefore cancel each other out when comparing regula P. Vrtiˇcka et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 1067–1082  1079  tion conditions. However, note that we used a similar instruction to “imagine real situations” during ESUP (but with the additional suppression task), and nevertheless found reliable differences in brain responses between these conditions. More importantly, these task parameters did not affect our ﬁndings concerning the different impact of each ER strategy on emotional stimulus processing in other cortical and limbic brain areas, such as the amygdala, insula, and ventro-medial prefrontal areas (see below).  4.3. Emotion regulation as a function of valence  We were able to identify three brain areas where different ER conditions selectively inﬂuenced the processing of negative valence information (NEG vs. POS emotional images), including the dorso-medial PFC (dmPFC), anterior insula (aINS), and medial fusiform/lingual gyrus (mFG/LG; see Fig. 6). By contrast, no speciﬁc effects were found for the processing of positive valence (POS vs. NEG emotional pictures). Because NEG images were generally perceived as more arousing than POS images (see above), these effects of valence might also be partly attributed to the arousing value of visual scenes. However, both arousal and valence represent the most salient affective dimensions that can inﬂuence perception and attention towards emotional stimuli (Sabatinelli, Bradley, Fitzsimmons, & Lang, 2005; Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009). Importantly, these differences in arousal did not confound our critical comparisons between SOC and NSOC stimuli (see below).  In the dmPFC (see Fig. 6a), the relative increase to NEG versus POS scenes was selectively abolished during REAP (as compared to NAT as well as ESUP). Activation of this pre-frontal brain area in the context of ER has previously been described during up- and downregulation of either negative (Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004) or positive (Kim & Hamann, 2007) emotions. In addition, the dmPFC has previously been reported to mediate self-monitoring and self-evaluation processes by computing internal representations of one’s own and others’ mind (Harris, Todorov, & Fiske, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2006), and is thought to contribute to the continuous updating of the value of actions (or errors) in order to regulate behavior (Amodio & Frith, 2006; Botvinick, 2007). Previous work on dmPFC responses to emotional stimuli also suggests that this brain region is involved in explicit affective judgments (Lane, Fink, Chau, & Dolan, 1997; Lane, Reiman, Ahern, Schwartz, & Davidson, 1997; Lane, Reiman, Bradley et al., 1997), and preferentially activates to emotionally arousing conditions (Dolcos, LaBar, & Cabeza, 2004; Kensinger & Schacter, 2006). Accordingly, our new data suggests that REAP might reduce the cognitive aspects of emotion processing in dmPFC, related to self-monitoring and evaluation of behavioral actions, when emotional signiﬁcance of visual scenes is lessened by the “pretend unreal” instruction (REAP). This reduction in activity nicely dovetails with our behavioral data showing a signiﬁcant decrease of subjective emotion ratings during REAP (but not ESUP).  By contrast, the anterior insula (aINS) activation to NEG stimuli was attenuated during both REAP and ESUP (see Fig. 6c). Previous imaging work has consistently demonstrated that the aINS is involved in the representation of aversive stimuli, particularly disgust (Mataix-Cols et al., 2008; Phillips et al., 2004) and pain (Singer et al., 2004). Insula responses are speciﬁcally linked to the affective, but not sensory, components of pain (Singer et al., 2004). Moreover, its activation reﬂects the degree of bodily arousal evoked by NEG stimulus content, which might interface cognitive control with changes in autonomic responses during ER (Critchley et al., 2002). Because NEG scenes in our study often displayed people experiencing pain or distressing conditions (SOC category), as well as situations representing harmful or disgust conditions (NSOC category), the decreases in aINS activation might be interpreted as a reduction of the affective component of empathic responses and/or disgust. However, inspection of aINS responses across conditions  showed a relative preference for nonsocial over social stimuli (see result section 3.4.1), and a selective effect of REAP and ESUP on the processing of nonsocial (but not social) stimuli was also found in a partly overlapping region (see result section 3.4.2 and Fig. 7). Taken together, these data indicate that insula responses were mainly driven by negative nonsocial scenes, hence presumably related to disgust more than to pain or empathy. This interpretation is corroborated by the main effects of NEG > POS and NSOC > SOC that both revealed signiﬁcant activations in the insula (Tables 1 and 2). Thus, our results demonstrate that both REAP and ESUP strategies produced a convergent modulatory effect on emotional processing of nonsocial aversive information in the insula, a brain area known to play a central role in the autonomic and subjective dimensions of affective responses (Critchley et al., 2002).  We also found that the processing of negative stimuli was selectively reduced by both REAP and ESUP in the medial fusiform/lingual cortex (see Fig. 6b). These regions showed preferential responses to nonsocial stimuli, consistent with their role in the visual processing of complex objects and scenes (Haxby et al., 2001; Pourtois et al., 2009). This modulation by ER accords with topdown inﬂuences on sensory processing in extrastriate visual areas for emotionally arousing and threat-related (e.g., fear conditioned) stimuli (Pourtois, Schwartz, Seghier, Lazeyras, & Vuilleumier, 2006; Sabatinelli et al., 2005; Vuilleumier & Driver, 2007), which may be driven by greater attention allocation and/or direct inﬂuences from amygdala (Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009; Vuilleumier et al., 2004). Accordingly, the reduction of differential responses to negative versus positive scenes during REAP as well as ESUP in visual cortex suggests a decrease in attention allocation to the sensory content of emotional scenes as a consequence of ER. During REAP, participants had to look at the scenes while imaging an artiﬁcial setting (“pretend unreal” as in TV or movie clips); whereas during ESUP, they had to concentrate on the inhibition of behavioral manifestations of emotion, thereby altering emotional responses and limiting attentional resources.  In sum, we found distinct effects of ER on the representation of negative emotional information, partly reﬂecting a modulation of the high arousal value of these stimuli, and involving several processing stages in distinct brain areas. Whereas the cognitive processes mediated by dmPFC were more speciﬁcally affected during REAP, visual processing in extrastriate cortex and affective responses in insula were modulated during both REAP and ESUP.  4.4. Emotion regulation as a function of social content  Differential responses to social (vs. nonsocial) emotional images were attenuated by ER in medial prefrontal (mPFC) and medial orbitofrontal (mOFC) cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex (see Fig. 8). All these regions are implicated in distinct aspects of social cognition. In addition, their activity was selectively modulated by REAP (not ESUP), except for the mPFC that was equally inﬂuenced by both ER conditions.  Abundant evidence points to a major role of mPFC in mentalizing about self and others (Gilbert et al., 2007; Mitchell et al., 2006), including the representation of personal emotional experiences and dispositions (called reﬂective awareness; Lane & McRae, 2004). Likewise, increased activity in PCC has been observed during tasks involving the attribution of emotion to self and/or other (Johnson et al., 2006; Ochsner, Knierim et al., 2004) and during theory of mind (Gobbini, Koralek, Bryan, Montgomery, & Haxby, 2007), besides an activation to social stimuli and affective information about familiar persons in general (Britton et al., 2006; Pourtois, Schwartz, Seghier, Lazeyras, & Vuilleumier, 2005; Vrtiˇcka, Andersson, Sander, & Vuilleumier, 2009). Therefore, the response of mPFC and PCC to social versus nonsocial images in our study was most likely related to mentalizing processes and the attribution of emotional experi 1080  P. Vrtiˇcka et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 1067–1082  ences to humans seen in social images, as opposed to the inanimate displays seen in nonsocial images. Importantly, our results suggest that these attributional processes were attenuated by both REAP and ESUP strategies. These data further demonstrate that medial prefrontal activity during emotion regulation might be speciﬁcally related to the social meaning of emotional events.  In contrast, mOFC activation was signiﬁcantly reduced during REAP only, and is generally considered to play a major role in reinforcement-guided decision making, especially in terms of the context-sensitive evaluation of outcomes (Rushworth, Behrens, Rudebeck, & Walton, 2007). This reduced activation of mOFC to social images during REAP might correspond to a decrease in cognitive operations required to compute the possible outcomes of social scenarios displayed in these scenes, involving for example intentionality–unlike the representation of more basic emotional cues such as appetitive food and disgusting material, typically depicted in nonsocial scenes (Hariri et al., 2002).  It should be noted here that both PCC and mPFC activation are also activated during resting, representing important components of the so-called default network (Buckner, Andrews-Hanna, & Schacter, 2008). Such overlap may agree with the notion that, when resting, subjects often tend to engage in internally focused mental activity that includes autobiographical memory retrieval and thinking about others (Buckner et al., 2008). Accordingly, changes in resting state activity have been observed following transient emotional events (Eryilmaz et al., 2011) and may reﬂect a role for these regions in social emotion regulation. Future studies should address more directly the possible associations between default mode and emotion regulation processes.  4.5. Amygdala lateralization during emotion regulation  Finally, and importantly, our results unveil a signiﬁcant hemispheric lateralization in amygdala responses as a function of both the stimulus content and the ER strategy used (see Fig. 9). While bilateral amygdalae were generally more responsive to social than nonsocial scenes, this activation showed a distinct impact of REAP and ESUP in the left and right hemispheres. Firstly, REAP (but not ESUP) led to a complete elimination of the relative increase to social versus nonsocial images only in left amygdala. Conversely, in the right amygdala, this relative increase to social versus nonsocial images was selectively abolished during ESUP (but not REAP). In other words, cognitive re-evaluation (REAP) of social emotional information predominantly inﬂuenced neural activity in the left amygdala, whereas the right amygdala activation to the same scenes was more inﬂuenced by behavioral inhibition of emotional expression (ESUP).  This lateralization appears consistent with asymmetries found in a few other fMRI studies. On the one hand, two studies reported that up- and down-regulation of negative emotions by REAP affected activity in the left amygdala more signiﬁcantly than in the right amygdala (Kim & Hamann, 2007; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). On the other hand, another study found that down-regulation of sexual arousal inﬂuenced right amygdala activation selectively (Beauregard et al., 2001). Taken together, these data suggest that up- and down-regulation of emotion in left amygdala may reﬂect the use of more “cognitive”, perhaps verbally mediated strategies, whereas regulation in the right amygdala may be more related to “bodily” or nonverbal strategies speciﬁc to the non-dominant hemisphere (Kim & Hamann, 2007; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). Accordingly, a recent meta-analysis on lateralized amygdala activations linked to emotional memory (Sergerie, Lepage, & Armony, 2006) proposed that: (1) the right amygdala may be involved in the fast, relatively automatic detection of emotional stimuli; and (2) the left amygdala may be involved in a more sustained and detailed cognitive processing stage. These previous accounts accord  with our new data indicating that the left amygdala responses to social (negative) emotional stimuli might be more strongly inﬂuenced by cognitive re-evaluation (REAP), possibly using verbal scripts, whereas emotion processing in the right amygdala might more readily be modulated by behavioral inhibition (ESUP) with less explicit cognitive evaluative components. In the future, it will be important to further reﬁne such lateralization effects in terms of associated peripheral arousal measures (apart from subjective emotional ratings).  Importantly, it should be emphasized that these bilateral amygdala activations were driven by differential responses to SOC versus NSOC stimuli, but we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant amygdala activation for the contrasts between NEG versus POS scenes. This pattern is consistent with data from several previous experiments describing preferential amygdala activation to SOC stimuli including faces, pictures, or ﬁlm-clips (e.g., Britton et al., 2006; Goossens et al., 2009; Hariri et al., 2002; Norris et al., 2004). These results also accord with recent proposals that the amygdala might be particularly tuned to the intrinsic salience or biological importance of SOC stimuli (Sander, Grafman, & Zalla, 2003), rather than to threat or other speciﬁc emotion categories.  Lastly, our ﬁndings do not entirely corroborate a previous fMRI study that also compared REAP and ESUP, but found a sustained insula and amygdala activation during the suppression of negative emotions (Goldin et al., 2008). However, this study identiﬁed the effects of ESUP at a late latency (10.5− 15 s) after exposure to ﬁlmclips, based on the assumption that ESUP should operate only after emotions have been generated, and therefore arise later than REAP effects (Gross, 1998). Because we applied a different methodology with a brief image exposure of 2 s, the results of these two studies are difﬁcult to compare. In addition, Goldin et al. (2008) did not distinguish between responses to social and nonsocial emotional stimuli, a dimension that clearly determined the magnitude of amygdala and insula responses in our study. More research is needed to further elucidate the distinct time-courses of ESUP and REAP on activity in subcortical and cortical brain regions during emotional processing.  4.6. Limitations  One potential limitation of the present investigation was that we studied women only and did not control for any possible menstrual cycle effects. Because females may show distinct patterns of brain responses to emotional stimuli and exhibit variations due to hormonal ﬂuctuations (see e.g., Andreano & Cahill, 2010), it remains to be seen in future studies whether the current effects can be extended to males and whether they may vary according to hormonal levels. However, our results are comparable with other studies on emotion perception and regulation that also scanned female participants only and did not record the cycle parameters (e.g., Ochsner, Knierim et al., 2004, Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004; Kim & Hamann, 2007). Moreover, it is unlikely that any emotion or regulation effect contingent on a speciﬁc time-point in the menstrual cycle would survive our statistical threshold at the group level, and none of the emotional condition used here involved material associated with attractiveness or erotism which could be particularly sensitive to menstrual ﬂuctuations (see e.g., Gizewski et al., 2006). Another possible limitation might stem from the relatively short exposure time of 2 s used for emotional and neutral images (see Section 2). Although exposure times of 2 s or even less are standard in fMRI research involving emotional stimuli and effective to activate relevant brain structures (e.g., Britton et al., 2006; Goossens et al., 2009; Hariri et al., 2002; Norris et al., 2004), may paradigms in the ﬁeld of emotion regulation have employed longer picture viewing times (e.g., Beauregard et al., 2001; Kim & Hamann, 2007; Koenigsberg et al., 2010; Levesque et al., 2003; Mak et al., 2009;  P. Vrtiˇcka et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 1067–1082  1081  Ochsner et al., 2002; Ochsner, Ray et al., 2004). However, in contrast to these investigations where regulation strategies alternate on a trial-by-trial basis and hence require the search for imagespeciﬁc adjustments (e.g., re-interpretations during REAP), here we applied a blocked design where regulation could be implemented in a more sustained manner (as already used elsewhere, e.g., Harenski & Hamann, 2006; Phan et al., 2005) and was guided by controlled instructions (e.g., “pretend unreal” for the REAP strategy) for all stimulus conditions and all participants. Therefore, although precluding a modulation of longer emotional “states” (see Eryilmaz, Van De Ville, Schwartz, & Vuilleumier, 2011), our study nonetheless could focus on the selective effects of REAP and/or ESUP on stimulus-driven emotional responses and was actually capable of delineating pronounced modulations in several subcortical and limbic brain areas.  5. Conclusion  By directly comparing cognitive reappraisal (REAP) and behavioral inhibition (ESUP) as two major strategies for emotion regulation, and differentiating their effect on distinct dimensions of emotional stimuli (including social versus nonsocial signiﬁcance besides positive versus negative valence factors), the present study yields several new insights into the neural mechanisms of emotion regulation in humans.  On the one hand, we found that a number of regions in right dorsolateral PFC were differentially recruited by emotional scenes during REAP or ESUP, but regardless of content, suggesting a general role in regulatory processes. Only the right MFG showed greater increases for negative social scenes compared to other image categories, presumably reﬂecting the greater emotional saliency of these stimuli, and hence the greater demands for successful regulation.  On the other hand, we identiﬁed several sites where ER had a differential impact on speciﬁc aspects of stimulus processing. Some regions were selectively modulated by REAP. These included the right dmPFC, which was preferentially engaged by negative valence information, as well as the left amygdala, PCC, and medial OFC, which all were involved in processing social information. Altogether, these modulations are likely to reﬂect changes in self-monitoring, evaluation of personal relevance, and anticipation of potential outcomes, under the inﬂuence of REAP strategies. Because emotional responses to the negative or social conditions in these areas were selectively attenuated during REAP but not ESUP, our ﬁndings suggest that the “pretend unreal” strategy implied a predominant modulation of high-level cognitive representations related to social judgment, mental imagery, and/or self-relevant association processes. Conversely, the right amygdala was the only region to be more strongly modulated by ESUP than REAP, possibly reﬂecting a speciﬁc impact of ESUP on autonomic and physiological components of emotions mediated by the right amygdala. This predominant right-sided effect of ESUP contrasted with the stronger left-sided effect of REAP, although both amygdalae were equally responsive to social information overall. This result reveals a significant lateralization in ER effects on the human amygdalae, possibly reﬂecting a differential impact of verbal, cognitive strategies (REAP) and non-verbal, arousal-related strategies (ESUP) on the left and right side, respectively.  Finally, several brain regions were modulated by both REAP and ESUP. These included the right insula and extrastriate visual areas (medial fusiform/lingual gyrus), which were most sensitive to negative nonsocial scenes involving disgust and other harmful situations, but also the right mPFC which preferentially responded to social stimuli. These activation patterns may reﬂect common inﬂuences of the two ER strategies on attention and perception,  changes in affective processes underlying arousal and pain-related representations, as well as higher cognitive effects related to mentalizing about self and others. More generally, we surmise that the more widespread effects of REAP relative to ESUP may reﬂect the more efﬁcient and greater beneﬁts of the former over the latter strategy (Gross, 2002; Jackson et al., 2000).  Taken together, our ﬁndings therefore do not only highlight the distributed nature of neural changes induced by emotion regulation, but also reveal the selectivity of impact for different strategies (re-appraisal or expressive suppression) and for different dimensions of emotional information (social content or valence). This underscores the importance of comparing different strategies and different stimulus categories when investigating emotion regulation, in order to better understand the speciﬁcity and underlying mechanisms of these effects. Only by carefully taking into account these different factors, we will be able to better apprehend the effective impact of emotion regulation and eventually develop more efﬁcient intervention therapies in clinical disorders related to emotion regulation dysfunctions.

Here we used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate how a three-week ﬂuoxetine intervention inﬂuences neural activity related to risk taking and reward processing. Employing a double-blinded parallel-group design, 29 healthy young males were randomly assigned to receive 3 weeks of a daily dose of 40 mg ﬂuoxetine or placebo. Participants underwent task-related fMRI prior to and after the three-week intervention while performing a card gambling task. The task required participants to choose between two decks of cards. Choices were associated with different risk levels and potential reward magnitudes. Relative to placebo, the SSRI intervention did not alter individual risk-choice preferences, but modiﬁed neural activity during decision-making and reward processing: During the choice phase, SSRI reduced the neural response to increasing risk in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based decision-making. During the outcome phase, a midbrain region showed an independent decrease in the responsiveness to rewarding outcomes. This midbrain cluster included the raphe nuclei from which serotonergic modulatory projections originate to both cortical and subcortical regions. The ﬁndings corroborate the involvement of the normally functioning 5HT-system in decision-making under risk and processing of monetary rewards. The data suggest that prolonged SSRI treatment might reduce emotional engagement by reducing the impact of risk during decision-making or the impact of reward during outcome evaluation.  © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  The central serotonergic system has been implicated in a wide range of emotional and cognitive functions, including the processing of emotional faces and rewards, and value based decision-making. For instance, a genetic polymorphism of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter has been linked with variations in the response of brain regions underlying human emotional behavior (Firk et al., 2013; Hariri et al., 2002). Interventional studies in humans that combine acute pharmacological manipulations of the 5-HT system with functional MRI (fMRI) provided a new line of evidence for the contribution of 5-HT signaling to discrete  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance, Centre for Functional and Diagnostic Imaging and Research, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Kettegaard Alle 30, DK-2650 Hvidovre, Denmark.

In healthy individuals, a dietary reduction of central serotonin activity, referred to as acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), altered decision-making processes by decreasing the impact of large monetary rewards on individual choices (Rogers et al., 2003). In a recent pharmacological fMRI study, we showed that ATD and acute administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have opposing effects on the neural response of the amygdala and middle frontal cortex to negative monetary outcomes during a gambling task (Macoveanu et al., 2013a). Further, we found that a four-week SSRI intervention in individuals at familial risk for depression altered rewardrelated neural responses in orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus (Macoveanu et al., 2014).  While these studies provide converging evidence that variations in 5-HT levels can modulate regional neural activity in key areas of decision-making and reward processing, the global 5-HT challenges employed in these studies did not result in overt changes in risktaking behavior. This can be due to the different, sometimes opposing  J. Macoveanu et al. / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 434–442  435  functional effects of the distinct 5-HT receptors, which may prevent a consistent change in behavior (Hayes and Greenshaw, 2011). Therefore, the impact on behavior might be stronger for pharmacological interventions that preferentially shape the function of distinct 5-HT receptors. Indeed, healthy individuals displayed an increase in loss aversive behavior after acute blockade of 5-HT2A receptors (Macoveanu et al., 2013b). The behavioral changes were associated with changes in the neural response to negative monetary outcomes in key areas involved in decision-making and reward, namely frontopolar cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatum (VS).  SSRIs are widely used to treat psychiatric conditions that have been linked with serotonergic dysfunctions such as major depression and anxiety disorders. The primary action of SSRIs is to block the 5-HT transporter which clears synaptic 5-HT, thereby increasing tissue 5-HT levels (Nutt et al., 1999). However, marked neuropharmacological and neurophysiological differences have been observed between acute and prolonged SSRI interventions (Benmansour et al., 2002; Kreiss and Lucki, 1995). Accordingly, the therapeutic response is often delayed, requiring at least 2 weeks of daily administration in affective disorders (Baldwin et al., 2009).  Despite of its long-term use in psychiatric disorders, relatively little is known about the neural effects of prolonged SSRI administration on brain function in healthy individuals. A deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms altered by prolonged SSRI administration may improve the efﬁciency of SSRI treatment of affective disorders and reduce undesired side effects. These considerations motivated the present study in which we explored the role of serotonergic signaling in regulating the brain activity associated with risky monetary choices and reward processing. Healthy adult male participants were investigated in a double-blinded parallel-group design, receiving either a daily dose of 40 mg ﬂuoxetine for 3 weeks or placebo. Before and upon completion of the pharmacological investigation the volunteers performed a card gambling task while undergoing fMRI. The same paradigm was previously used in conjunction with acute ATD and SSRI interventions in a healthy cohort (Macoveanu et al., 2013a) and a prolonged SSRI intervention in individuals at high familial risk for depression (Macoveanu et al., 2014). We hypothesized that a threeweek SSRI intervention in healthy individuals would have a different effect compared to the acute SSRI intervention and also differ compared to the effects observed in individuals at high familial risk. We expected the three-week SSRI intervention to alter the neural process related to risky decisions in key regions associated with risk taking (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventral striatum (VS) and insula) (Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005; Tobler et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2012). We further predicted a desensitization of speciﬁc regions of the reward system previously observed to be sensitive to serotonergic modulation: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) (Macoveanu et al., 2013a; Taylor et al., 2006) and the midbrain raphe nuclei which provide the bulk of serotonergic projections to neocortex and subcortical regions (Hornung, 2003; Nakamura, 2013).  Methods  Participants  Thirty-two healthy males (age, years: mean ± s.d. = 25.8 ± 4.5, range = 20.2–40.4) were recruited by advertisement and received ﬁnancial compensation for their participation in the study. We included only males in order to have a homogenous group given the known inﬂuence of gender and sex hormones on 5-HT signaling (Cosgrove et al., 2007; Moses-Kolko et al., 2011). The following exclusion criteria were applied: 1) primary psychiatric disease, 2) substance or drug abuse, and 3) severe systemic or neurological disease based on history and physical/neurological examination. One subject was excluded from the analysis for missing behavioral feedback due to technical problems and two others for lacking one of the fMRI sessions. Thus, for the analysis,  13 subjects were included in the active and 16 in the placebo group. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the research protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee in Copenhagen [H-KF-2006-20 Amendment 23830]. The participants took also part in a parallel positron emission tomography (PET) study which investigated the effects of SSRI intervention on cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding (Haahr et al., 2014). More details on recruitment procedure and the SSRI intervention can be found in the companion paper (Haahr et al., 2014).  The SSRI intervention  Participants were randomly assigned to receive identical capsules containing either ﬂuoxetine or placebo. Intervention group assignment was based on matching for age, education and 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism. Genotyping of the 5-HTTLPR was performed differentiating between LA, LG and S alleles (Hu et al., 2006; Lesch et al., 1996) and was done in order to assess genotypic heterogeneity, thus controlling for possible variance in the results related to the 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism. The potential effect of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was however not in the focus of the current study. A blinded investigator instructed the participants to take one capsule (20 mg) per day orally the ﬁrst 3 days and hereafter two capsules (40 mg) until the followup MRI scan, which has previously been reported to represent an effective clinical dose (Charlier et al., 2000).  Participants underwent two functional MRI investigations, just before starting the SSRI intervention and right after approximately 3 weeks of SSRI intake (days between investigations mean ± s.d.: 19.3 ± 3.5 for the SSRI group and 21.1 ± 2.9 for the placebo group). Participants were contacted via phone calls 1–2 times during the intervention period and once after by a licensed physician to assess possible side-effects according to the UKU rating scale (Lingjaerde et al., 1987). Participants were further asked during the call if they missed any medication days. To further evaluate compliance to the medication protocol, blood samples were collected 1–2 weeks post intervention-onset and at follow-up. Fluoxetine and norﬂuoxetine concentrations were measured with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) (Watts et al., 2008).  The blinding of the participants and the investigators involved in data acquisition and analysis was effectively maintained throughout the study as when informally asked, neither the participants, nor the investigators were able to correctly guess the intervention received by the study participants. The maintenance of blinding is further supported by the lack of differences in reported side-effects between ﬂuoxetine and placebo individuals. Investigators were ﬁrst unblinded after completion of the functional MRI analysis.  The card gambling task  During fMRI, the participants performed a gambling task which is described in detail in Macoveanu et al. (2013a). Each trial started with an information screen displaying the total amount of money available in Danish Kroner (6 DKK ≈ $1 USD) and the bet size. Seven playing cards were randomly distributed into two sets displayed face down (Fig. 1A). One of the cards was the “ace of hearts” and participants were asked to choose one of the two sets they believed contained the ace. Upon selection, the location of the ace was revealed. A correct choice was rewarded with the amount displayed below the set. For a wrong choice the subject would lose the bet. There were six possible risk choices with associated potential rewards. Each of the lower risk options (with odds of 4/7, 5/7 and 6/7) was paired to a corresponding high-risk option (with odds of 3/7, 2/7 and 1/7 choices) in a forcedchoice design (Fig. 1B). In contrast to positive outcomes, negative outcomes were always associated with the same loss magnitude, but differed in terms of missed rewards. The experimental design equated the expected values of the high and low risk choices (i.e., the sum of  436  J.

The card gambling task. Adapted with permission from (Macoveanu et al., 2013a). (A) All trials had three phases: Information, Choice and Outcome. During the Information phase, participants were informed about the sum of money they had accumulated and the bet size (3, 4 or 5 DKK), which could be lost. In the Choice phase, two sets of cards were presented together with the associated monetary reward below. Participants chose the set of cards where they believed the “ace of hearts” would be hidden. In the Outcome phase, the “ace of hearts” was revealed, providing the participants a feedback whether they chose the right set and won the associated reward or lost the bet.

The participants performed the gambling task during two fMRI runs separated by a one-minute break and received the highest ﬁnal amount in one of the sessions (in Danish kroner). Each of the two fMRI runs lasted for 11 minutes and included different randomization of 28 choices between one and six cards, 28 choices between two and ﬁve cards, 28 choices between three and four cards and 28 null events of the same length as a real event where a ﬁxation cross was presented instead of the task screen.  MRI data acquisition  The MRI images were acquired with an eight-channel head array using a 3 Tesla MR scanner (Siemens Trio, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol used for baseline and follow-up investigation was identical. BOLD-sensitive fMRI used a T2*-weighted gradient echo spiral echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 2.5 s, echo time (TE) of 26 ms, and ﬂip angle of 90°. The fMRI measurements were obtained in two fMRI runs, each including 260 brain volumes. Each brain volume consisted of 41 slices with a slice thickness of 3 mm, between-slice gap of 0.75 mm, and a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 192 × 192 mm using a 64 × 64 grid. The EPI sequence was optimized for signal recovery of basal frontal cortex by tilting slice orientation from a transverse toward a coronal orientation by about 30° and the use of a preparation gradient pulse (Deichmann et al., 2003). In addition, high-resolution 3D structural T1-weighted spin echo images were obtained after the ﬁrst session of BOLD fMRI (TI = 800 ms, TE = 3.93 ms, TR = 1540 ms, ﬂip angle 9°; 256 × 256 FOV; 192 slices). Pulse and respiration were recording during the entire MRI session.  Functional MRI data analysis  Pre-processing and statistical analysis of the acquired functional images were performed using SPM8 (www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/ spm8). The images were realigned to the ﬁrst image in the time series, normalized to a standard template and smoothed using a symmetric 8-mm Gaussian kernel. First level statistical analysis employed eventrelated general linear models with six regressors for the choice phase  (one for each risk level, from the lowest odds 1/7, to the highest odds 6/7, as illustrated in Fig. 1B) and six regressors for the outcome phase (three for negative and three for positive events) as follows: Due to different inter-individual bias in risk preference, enough number of measurements for all types of outcome events was achieved by grouping the outcome events two-by-two. Thus, outcomes events preceded by choices with odds of 1/7 and 2/7 were modeled together as “highrisk” events, outcomes events preceded by choices with odds of 3/7 and 4/7 as “medium-risk” events and outcomes events preceded by choices with odds of 5/7 and 6/7 as “low-risk” events. In addition to the six choice phase regressors and six outcome regressors the model also included 44 additional nuisance regressors to correct for physiological noise related to pulse (12) respiration (8) and movement (24). The nuisance regressors have been shown to reduce ﬁrst and higher order autocorrelations as well as non-normality in residuals and result in improved sensitivity (Glover et al., 2000; Lund et al., 2006). We constructed three 1st level contrasts of interest: 1) risk choice contrast by assigning the six risk levels weights corresponding with a linear increase with the risk size, 2) positive outcome contrast (high-risk wins N low-risk wins) and 3) negative outcome (low-risk loss N highrisk loss). Because the loss amount was invariable and matched the bet size, we differentiated negative outcomes by the value of the missed reward, which was high for low-risk and low for high-risk choices. We hypothesized that losing following a low-risk choice would be perceived more aversive compared to losing following a high-risk choice (Macoveanu et al., 2013a). One subject lacked low-risk decisions for the follow-up scan and two subjects lacked high-risk positive outcomes for the baseline scan.  The three ﬁrst level contrasts were included in separate 2 × 2 second level ANOVA models with factors: “group” (SSRI or placebo) and “time” (baseline and follow-up). The models further included a “subject” factor and main effect of time and group regressors to account for general differences between the two intervention groups that were not speciﬁc to the experimental task. Effects of intervention on the BOLD response were evaluated using 2nd level group-by-time interaction contrasts (e.g. [SSRIbaseline − SSRIfollow-up] − [Placebobaseline − Placebofollow-up]). Upon signiﬁcant or trend-level ﬁndings (see below for deﬁnition) post hoc t-tests were used to evaluate the signiﬁcance of group differences. We further investigated whether the individual SSRI induced changes  J. Macoveanu et al. / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 434–442  437  in neural response during the outcome phase were casually related to the changes observed during the choice phase. We therefore performed a correlation analysis between the individual peak regional changes in parameter estimates obtained for the choice and for the outcome phases. An additional correlation analysis was performed to test whether, at the individual level, the relative change in the frequency of high-risk choices after SSRI intervention correlated with the SSRI induced alterations in the neural response during the choice and outcome phases.  Clusters were considered signiﬁcant at p b 0.05 after family-wise error (FWE) correction for multiple non-independent comparisons. The extent of each cluster was thresholded by applying an uncorrected voxel threshold of p b 0.005. Voxels that survived FWE correction at the voxel level, but were not located within a signiﬁcant cluster are considered trends.  For regions that were a priori deﬁned as regions of interest (ROI), i.e., the OFC, VS and insula for risky decisions and dmPFC and raphe for reward (see Introduction), the correction for multiple comparisons was restricted to voxels within respective ROIs. The obtained FWE corrected p values were further Bonferroni corrected in order to account for the number of a priori ROIs for the choice and outcome phases (pFWE-B corr). The ROIs were constructed using the WFU PickAtlas toolbox and the AAL atlas (Maldjian et al., 2003; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). Since the raphe nuclei are not identiﬁable on structural MRI, we estimated their location by following the description provided by Kranz et al. (2012). We ﬁrst identiﬁed the MNI coordinates for the centers of the medial raphe nucleus (MRN; x,y,z = 1, −24, −12) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN; x,y,z = 1, −26, −18) respectively. We constructed the ROIs as spheres of 4 mm radius centered on these coordinates. The raphe ROI was then formed by concatenating the MRN and DRN spherical ROIs. Signiﬁcant clusters are reported with Z-score and stereotactic MNI coordinates of the regional maxima [x, y, z]. All pFWE-corr values reﬂect correction across the whole-brain unless otherwise stated. Group data are given as mean ± s.d.  State measure of psychopathology  Participants completed self-reported questionnaires to assess distress and psychopathological states at baseline and following the intervention. Subclinical depression symptoms were evaluated according to the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), (Forsell, 2005) and the Global Severity Index (GSI) of subclinical psychopathology from the Symptom Checklist (SCL-GSI) (Derogatis, 1994).  Evaluation of choice behavior during gambling and depression scores  Risk taking behavior during gambling was evaluated as the frequency of the different risk choices which were entered into a repeated measures analyses of variance (rmANOVA) model (PASW-SPSS20 statistics software, Chicago) with time of investigation (baseline and follow-up) and risk level (3 levels, odds of 4/7, 5/7 and 6/7) as within subject factors and type of intervention (SSRI and placebo) as between subject factor. In order to avoid including perfectly collinear data, we included in the statistical model only the frequencies of the 4/7, 5/7 and 6/7 choices. The impact of the outcome of the immediately preceding trial on risk preference (assessed as the frequency of high-risk choices with odds 1/7, 2/7 and 3/7) was evaluated in an ANOVA with a time factor (baseline and follow-up), a group factor (SSRI and placebo), a risk level factor (3 levels, high, medium and low-risk) and an outcome factor (negative and positive).  Depression symptoms according to MDI and SCL-GSI were evaluated in ANOVA models with “time” as within factor and “intervention” as between subject factor. The general signiﬁcance threshold was set at p b 0.05 using the Greenhouse–Geisser correction for non-sphericity when appropriate. Conditional on signiﬁcant F-values, pair-wise posthoc t-tests were performed to further explore signiﬁcant main effects and interactions.  Results  Serum ﬂuoxetine measurements  Biochemical analyses conﬁrmed that participants in the SSRI group complied with the SSRI protocol. Participants who received active intervention had observable serum levels of ﬂuoxetine and norﬂuoxetine (Jannuzzi et al., 2002), both at the intermediate time point (ﬂuoxetine: 121 ± 51 μ/L, norﬂuoxetine 93 ± 31 μ/L) and at follow-up (ﬂuoxetine 168 ± 49 μ/L, norﬂuoxetine 148 ± 37 μ/L). Participants receiving placebo had no detectable serum ﬂuoxetine or norﬂoxetine throughout the intervention period. Hence, the SSRI intervention was effective to trigger the neurobiological responses mediating prolonged SSRI effects (Baldwin et al., 2009).  Gambling behavior during fMRI  Fig. 2 displays the distribution of choices across risk levels and conditions. Although choice behavior varied considerably across individuals, participants showed a general preference for high-risk choices (main effect of risk: F[2,54] = 13.7, p b 0.001). This preference for high-risk choices was more strongly expressed at follow-up compared to baseline investigation (F[2,54] = 3.6, p b 0.05). Compared to placebo, the SSRI intervention had no signiﬁcant time-dependent effect on risktaking behavior (group-by-time interaction: F[1,27] = 2.7, p = 0.1). ANOVA testing the impact of the immediately preceding outcome (negative or positive) on risk preference showed no signiﬁcant timedependent interaction between treatment group and type of outcome (F[1,27] = 0.6, p = 0.4) suggesting that the SSRI investigation did not alter the risk-taking behavior depending on the outcome of the preceding trial. Overall, large missed rewards decreased the probability of a high-risk choice in the immediately following trial (risk-by-outcome interaction: F[2,54] = 6.9, p b 0.01). Self-reported depressive symptoms as reﬂected by MDI and SCL-GSI scores did not differ between the SSRI and placebo group at baseline and after the three-week intervention (p N 0.05).  Neural activity scaled to the riskiness of choice  During the choice phase, regional activity scaled linearly with the risk level associated with the chosen gamble in a widespread cortico– subcortical network, comprising the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum (Table 1A). Relative to placebo, the SSRI intervention reduced the scaling of neural activity with the risk of choices in right lateral OFC (Fig. 3A). The two-factorial ANOVA (between-group factor: placebo and SSRI, within-subject factor: baseline and follow-up) yielded a group-by-time interaction for risk-related activity in lateral OFC (peak effect size at voxel = [22, 40, −12], Z = 4.0, voxel pFWE corr = 0.04 corrected within the OFC ROI). A post hoc t-test revealed a reduced choice-related activation of right lateral OFC with increasing risk after the SSRI intervention relative to baseline (peak effect size at voxel = [38, 32, −10], Z = 3.9, ROI pFWE-B corr = 0.03). Post hoc tests comparing between-group differences at baseline, at follow-up and the intervention effects in the placebo group revealed no signiﬁcant or trendlevel changes. At the subject level, the relative change in frequency of high-risk choices from baseline to follow-up did not correlate signiﬁcantly with the change in neural response to increasing risk in the SSRI group.  Neural responses to positive outcomes  Across all participants, a stronger neural response to high vs. low monetary rewards was found in core regions of the reward system including the ventral striatum, the midbrain, insula, and hippocampus (Table 1B). The two-factorial ANOVA (between-group factor: placebo and SSRI, within-subject factor: baseline and follow-up) identiﬁed  438  J. Macoveanu et al. / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 434–442  Fig. 2.

Post hoc t-tests comparing baseline with follow-up in the SSRI group revealed no signiﬁcant change in any of the cortical regions apart from the cluster covering the midbrain raphe nuclei. This midbrain region displayed a signiﬁcant attenuation after the three-week SSRI intervention (peak regional voxel [−2, −24, −16], Z = 3.2, ROI pFWE-B corr = 0.048). The post hoc test comparing baseline with follow-up in the placebo group revealed non-signiﬁcant (cluster pFWE N 0.05) increases in the clusters located in dmPFC, posterior parietal cortex and rostral supplementary motor area. These trends towards an increased responsiveness in these regions may reﬂect a sensitization to positive outcomes due to repeated task exposure in the placebo group, which may have been prevented by SSRI administration in the SSRI group. There was  no signiﬁcant difference between groups at baseline. The correlation analysis between the individual SSRI induced attenuations in lateral OFC to increasing risk choices and raphe to high vs. low monetary rewards yielded no signiﬁcant linear correlation (Pearson correlation = −0.3, p = 0.38).  Neural responses to negative outcomes  No brain region showed a difference in BOLD response to losses caused by high-risk choices as opposed to losses following low-risk choices across groups and measurements. The SSRI intervention also had no signiﬁcant effect on the processing of negative outcomes caused by low-risk vs. high-risk choices relative to placebo.  440  Discussion  J. Macoveanu et al. / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 434–442  We investigated the effects of a three-week ﬂuoxetine intervention on the neural response to value-based decision-making and reward processing in healthy young males. The SSRI intervention led to a decrease in the lateral orbitofrontal response to risky decisions. This was paralleled by a reduced response of the midbrain raphe nuclei to high monetary rewards caused by high-risk choices relative to low monetary rewards caused by low-risk choices. We found no SSRI induced changes in the neural response no negative monetary outcomes and no signiﬁcant change in risk-taking behavior.  Attenuated brain activity associated with risky gambles  Our experimental task introduced different magnitudes of risk while matching the expected values of the paired high-risk (with prospect of high reward) and low-risk (with prospect of low reward) choices. This enabled us to identify brain regions where regional activity increased linearly with the risk taken during a gamble. Compared to placebo, the three-week SSRI intervention attenuated the increase in activity with the riskiness of choice in lateral OFC. The OFC evaluates both rewarding and aversive stimuli and is critically involved in higher cognitive functions by integrating affective information in the decision-making processes (Liu et al., 2007; Paulmann et al., 2010). A reduced OFC sensitivity to rewarding cues following prolonged SSRI intake is consistent with a previous pharmacological fMRI studies (McCabe et al., 2010) and might be related to an SSRI-induced blunting of emotional responsivity to both positive and negative stimuli and associated side effects observed during prolonged clinical SSRI treatment (McCabe et al., 2010; Price et al., 2009).  Attenuation of brain response to rewarding outcomes  The medial and dorsal raphe nuclei are the main source of serotonergic innervation to the forebrain providing parallel projection to many cortical and subcortical structures that are part of the “reward circuitry” (Hornung, 2003). Previous studies have demonstrated that DRN and MRN cells respond phasically to reward events (Nakamura, 2013; Ranade and Mainen, 2009), yet their role in risk-related decisionmaking and reward processing remains incompletely understood. In this study, the three-week SSRI intervention reduced the response to high-risk high-gain outcomes in a midbrain region most likely encompassing the raphe nuclei. When interpreting this result, it is important to recall that we employed a gambling task in which the magnitude of a positive outcome was scaled the amount of risk that was taken in the gamble. Winning a high-risk gamble produced large monetary rewards, whereas winning a low-risk gamble produced small monetary reward. Our ﬁnding signiﬁcantly extends a recent study by Abler et al. (2011) which reported an attenuated response in a similar midbrain region to primary rewarding stimuli following a seven-day SSRI administration. We show that the attenuating effect of more sustained SSRI intake on reward processing also includes secondary (monetary) reward and that the attenuation is scaled to reward magnitude, preferentially reducing the response to large monetary gains. Given the coarse resolution of fMRI and the size of the midbrain cluster, the attenuated sensitivity to large monetary rewards after the SSRI intervention might also involve other midbrain structures such as the pedunculopontine nuclei (containing cholinergic neurons) and ventral tegmental area (containing dopaminergic neurons).  No SSRI-induced change in the neural response to negative outcomes  Previous pharmacological fMRI studies challenging the central 5-HT system have shown that 5-HT modulates the neural response to both appetitive and aversive stimuli (Macoveanu et al., 2013a, 2014; McCabe et al., 2010). In particular, using the same activation paradigm  we found altered neural response to low-risk negative outcomes (high missed reward) both following an acute SSRI intervention in healthy individuals (Macoveanu et al., 2013a) and following prolonged SSRI intervention in individuals at high familial risk for depression where the SSRIs reversed the abnormal OFC response in these individuals at risk (Macoveanu et al., 2014).  In contrast to these studies, the three-week SSRI intervention did not alter the neural response to negative monetary outcomes in our cohort of male individuals. We attribute this discrepancy to substantial differences in the effects of SSRI on functional brain networks depending between acute and prolonged SSRI interventions (Benmansour et al., 2002; Kreiss and Lucki, 1995). Another factor that may account for differential effects of SSRI is the functional state of the serotonergic system. SSRI treatment may effectively restore aberrant neural processes in individuals with dysfunctional serotonergic signaling, for instance in individuals with genetic liability for depression, but may fail to produce similar effects in individuals with normal serotonergic function. Further, the serotonergic effects of SSRI challenges on risk taking and reward processing may depend on trait differences in risk taking behavior across study populations. In the present study, male healthy participants showed a preference for high risk gambles. This risk-seeking trait might be associated with less serotonergic inﬂuence on the processing of negative outcomes.  No SSRI-induced change in risk-taking behavior  At baseline, both groups of male volunteers showed a behavioral bias for high-risk choices. This ﬁnding stands in contrast with our previous observations in a gender-mixed cohort where participants showed no consistent bias towards high- or low-risk choices (Macoveanu et al., 2013a). Relative to females, males employ an increased risk-taking behavior (Byrnes et al., 1999), which may account for the observed differences between the present and our previous cohort.  In a previous study using the same gambling paradigm we found acute blockade of the 5-HT2A receptor to increase risk-averse behavior (Macoveanu et al., 2013b). Since we expected the prolonged SSRI treatment in the present study to increase overall 5-HT transmission, including the transmission through the excitatory 2A receptor, we expected the three-week SSRI intervention to promote risk-taking behavior. However, in our healthy male cohort the three-week SSRI intervention had no signiﬁcant effect on risk-taking or risk-averse behavior compared to the placebo intervention. This ﬁnding is consistent with our previous data in healthy individuals undergoing acute global manipulations of the 5-HT system either by intravenous citalopram administration or ATD (Macoveanu et al., 2013a). A net SSRI-induced change in risk behavior may not be observed here, since SSRIs promote the 5-HT transmission through many types of 5-HT receptors which can have competing actions in speciﬁc cortical regions (Hayes and Greenshaw, 2011). Homeostatic mechanisms within or beyond the 5-HT system, involving other modulatory neurotransmitters may also limit the effect of prolonged SSRI treatment on healthy individuals. Finally, our male participants were already displaying risk-seeking behavior at baseline, which became more evident in the second fMRI session regardless of the pharmacological intervention (i.e., placebo or SSRI). Hence, a riskseeking trait in the male cohort might have resulted in a ceiling effect which obscured a possible facilitatory effect of SSRI on risk taking.  Potential neuronal mechanisms of SSRI action  SSRIs are thought to enhance 5-HT synaptic transmission by blocking the 5-HT transporter which clears synaptic 5-HT (Nutt et al., 1999). It has been proposed that SSRIs attain this facilitatory effect only once the auto-inhibitory feedback systems (mediated by 5-HT1A autoreceptors) is desensitized (Briley and Moret, 1993). The observed reduction in the neural response of OFC and raphe may be explained in relation to the hypothesized mechanism of action of SSRIs.  J. Macoveanu et al. / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 434–442  441  The reduction in OFC response to risky choices may be accounted for by two alternative mechanistic explanations depending on the hypothesized action of raphe on reward-related prefrontal processes: feedback inhibition or reinforcement. It has been shown that prolonged SSRI interventions enhance the tonic activation of forebrain inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors (Haddjeri et al., 1998). The increased inhibitory weight may lead to decreased orbitofrontal recruitment during decision-making processes. Alternatively, activation of inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors on midbrain raphe neurons during SSRI intervention may hamper raphe's tonic activity. This effect is pronounced following a single administration but may persist at a lower rate even when the 5-HT1A receptors become desensitized during repeated administration (Best et al., 2011; Briley and Moret, 1993). Midbrain raphe nuclei's reinforcement of OFC through efferent projections may therefore be weakened throughout the SSRI intervention. Our data does however not support the latter explanation since we found no signiﬁcant correlation between the magnitude of the SSRI induced response attenuation in OFC to risky choices and in raphe to positive outcomes.  Desensitization of inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors on the raphe neurons following prolonged SSRI intervention presumably leads to a restitution of raphe's function. Despite of this homeostatic mechanism, the rate of tonic ﬁring of serotonergic DRN and MRN cells has been suggested to be reduced during prolonged SSRI administration (Best et al., 2011) and may account for the observed attenuation of raphe response to monetary rewards following SSRI. Increased inhibitory feedback control from cortical regions might constitute an alternative mechanisms by which the SSRI intervention attenuates the raphe response to reward magnitude. Prolonged SSRI intake ampliﬁes 5-HT transmission in frontal regions which increased inhibitory feedback to the midbrain raphe nuclei through descending projections activated by postsynaptic 5-HT receptors (Sharp et al., 2007) or through activation of heteroreceptors (McDevitt and Neumaier, 2011). It is noteworthy that the SSRI induced changes in the raphe and OFC response were not found to be correlated, suggesting that these structures subserve distinct task-related processes, both dependent on serotonergic modulation.  Clinical perspective  The present study may serve as a benchmark for future studies evaluating the effects of SSRI interventions on risk-related decision-making and reward processing in depressed cohorts. The SSRI induced neurobiological changes in the “reward circuitry” may represent a neural correlate to the side effects observed in clinical treatment with SSRIs which report reduced affective arousal to pleasant and rewarding events (Opbroek et al., 2002; Price et al., 2009). However, psychiatric disorders like major depression are characterized by a pre-existing dysfunction in the 5-HT system (Risch and Nemeroff, 1992) as well as attenuated neural response to normally rewarding stimuli (Smoski et al., 2011). We therefore expect the prolonged SSRI intervention to act differently in clinical cohorts. Consequently, the present ﬁnding may not simply be extrapolated to patient groups with a dysfunctional 5-HT system. Such deviations from a normal response pattern in patients with depression or anxiety patterns will shed important light on the altered changeability of serotonergic signaling in psychiatric disorders.  In conclusion, our results provide new insights on the effects of prolonged SSRIs administration on risk related decision-making and reward processing in healthy individuals. We show a reduced response in key regions of the reward circuitry following prolonged SSRI intervention. We found a concurrent reduction in lateral orbitofrontal cortex and midbrain raphe activity to risky choices and positive outcomes respectively. At individual level, the magnitude of the reductions in these regions did however not correlate, indicating their involvement in distinct neural processes modulated by 5-HT reuptake inhibition. These ﬁndings may be of relevance for the use of SSRI treatment in psychiatric disorders like major depression, which are characterized by abnormal processing of rewards. Our results further expose the intricate  balance between the auto-inhibition of raphe through 5-HT autoreceptors and potentiation of serotonergic release in target regions by downregulation of the 5-HT transporter. Further studies are necessary to better understand the mechanism of action of SSRI medication.

In a neuroimaging study, we explored the common and distinct regions underlying these inference processes. We directly compared false belief reasoning (inferring an agent's false belief about an object's location or content) and counterfactual reasoning (inferring what the object's location or content would be if an agent had acted differently), both in contrast with a baseline condition of conditional reasoning (inferring what the true location or content of an object is). Results indicate that these three types of reasoning about social scenarios are supported by activations in the mentalizing network (left temporo-parietal junction and precuneus) and the executive control network (bilateral prefrontal cortex [PFC] and right inferior parietal lobule). In addition, representing a false belief or counterfactual state (both not directly observable in the external world) recruits additional activity in the executive control network (left dorsolateral PFC and parietal lobe). The results further suggest that counterfactual reasoning is a more complex cognitive process than false belief reasoning, showing stronger activation of the dorsomedial, left dorsolateral PFC, cerebellum and left temporal cortex.  © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

It supports the ability to predict how someone else experiences the world (social mentalizing), what people's beliefs are, even if they differ from reality. It also provides us the capacities to vividly simulate our personal pasts, and how these past events could have turned out differently (counterfactual thinking). Obviously, both mental simulations have in common that they allow us to imagine complex scenes that differ from reality, as we immediately observe(d) it. When we attempt to infer the beliefs of others, we may hold a different belief about reality at the same time. Also, when we image an alternative past, we are still aware of what really happened. What are the neural commonalities and differences of holding these two mental simulations? Investigating this question is the aim of the current functional imaging study, in order to shed further light on the processes underlying mental simulation.  Thinking about the beliefs of others is referred to as mentalizing or theory of mind, “the implicit or explicit attribution of mental states to others and self (desires, beliefs) in order to explain and predict what they will do” (Frith and Frith, 2010, p. 289). It is therefore a crucial capacity for successful social interaction. A common way to examine theory of mind is by the use of a false belief task, which assesses one  ⁎ Corresponding authors at: Department of Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel,  Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.

All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.12.043  particular aspect of our mentalizing ability: the understanding that other people's actions are determined by their (false) beliefs and not by what actually happened. A prototypical version of this task portrays two protagonists, Sally and Anne (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985). In this story, Sally places a marble into her basket, and after Sally left the room, Anne moves the marble into her own box. Fully matured belief reasoning or mentalizing is reﬂected in the belief that, upon her return, Sally will look in her basked, although the participants clearly know the new location of the marble (Wellman et al., 2001).  Counterfactual reasoning refers to making inferences about how an event or state could have been different. For instance, we can create a counterfactual state of affairs by changing the true outcome of an event (e.g., passing the exam instead of failing it) and inferring how this could have come about (e.g., “If I had studied the correct chapters”). An important attribute of this type of reasoning is that we adhere to the “nearest possible world” constraint (e.g., Rafetseder et al., 2013; Van Hoeck et al., 2012). During counterfactual reasoning we create a possible event that is nearest to the real event. We don't create a totally new event in which everything is different or impossible (make-believe; e.g. “If I had the best memory in the world, I would have passed the exam”) nor do we create a “general possible” event by applying typical regularities (basic conditional reasoning; e.g., studying long enough), because they may not always provide a better outcome (i.e., since you studied the wrong chapters; Rafetseder and Perner, 2010).  What do false belief and counterfactuals have in common? One common process is mentalizing. Like false beliefs, counterfactuals cannot directly be inferred from observation. Both thought processes involve integrating general knowledge and information in a mental  316  N. Van Hoeck et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 315–325  representation about a speciﬁc action or situation away from reality. So instead of only reasoning about reality (the true state of affairs), in a false belief state or a counterfactual state, we mentally simulate an alternative model representing contrary-to-the-fact assumptions. Failure to simulate (i.e., generate and/or reason from) these alternative representations results in “realist errors” (i.e., answering false belief and counterfactual question based on reality).  Another common process is executive control. Both false belief and counterfactual reasoning require extra executive control because simulating an alternative state of affairs entails holding this representation in mind (working memory), updating it with what we know about reality, but suppressing the information about reality that does not apply in the alternative state (inhibition), and the cognitive ﬂexibility to switch between the two representations. Recent research suggests that working memory, cognitive ﬂexibility and inhibitory control each partially mediated the relationship between the performance of children on false belief and counterfactual tasks (Drayton et al., 2011; Guajardo et al., 2009). Several developmental studies further show that children's performance on false belief and counterfactual tasks is positively related (e.g., Perner et al., 2002, 2004; Riggs and Robinson, 1998) and is linked to executive skills that improve between ages 3 and 5, the same time that realist errors decline (e.g., Beck et al., 2009; Carlson et al., 2004; Guajardo et al., 2009; Hughes and Ensor, 2007; Müller et al., 2007).  To increase our understanding of the communalities and differences between false beliefs and counterfactuals, this study directly compares the neurological substrates involved in both inferences. Many neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that false belief reasoning engages a so-called mentalizing network, encompassing the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the posterior cingulate (PCC) or precuneus (Carrington and Bailey, 2009; Lombardo et al., 2011; Mar, 2011; Schilbach et al., 2012; Spreng and Grady, 2010; Spreng and Mar, 2012; Spreng et al., 2009; Van Overwalle, 2009; Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009). This mentalizing network overlaps considerably with regions recruited during mental simulations of episodic events (including past, future and counterfactual episodic thinking), engaging an episodic memory network that comprises additional memoryrelated regions (including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex; Buckner and Carroll, 2007; De Brigard et al., 2013; Hassabis and Maguire, 2007, 2009; Martinelli et al., 2013; Spreng and Grady, 2010; Spreng et al., 2009; Spreng and Mar, 2012; Summerﬁeld et al., 2010; Van Hoeck et al., 2013). Hence, this mentalizing network supports mental simulations of social scenarios and thus might be common to false beliefs and social counterfactual reasoning. We concur with the idea put forward by Hassabis and Maguire (2007) that the underlying process shared by both inferences is concerned with scene construction, or the process of mentally generating and maintaining a complex and coherent event portraying goal-directed actions. In the present study, however, we expect memory-related activations to play a minor role, since we present short descriptions of non-personal events, rather than recalling and reimagining memories of one's past.  In addition, recent research suggests that the ﬂexible retrieval and representation of different belief perspectives during false belief reasoning requires executive control functions that are subserved by the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Hartwright et al., 2012; Van der Meer et al., 2011). More generally, it has been suggested that executive control functions needed for goal-directed mental simulations (e.g., integrating and monitoring multiple information, updating and implementation of goal-directed behavior, working memory, etc.) are supported by an executive control network. This network comprises the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) extending to the larger posterior medial frontal cortex (pmFC; detection of multiple or conﬂicting inputs) and the dorsolateral PFC and inferior parietal lobe (IPL; working memory, attention, integration and general support of cognitive operations) (e.g., Barbey et al., 2012; Botvinick et al., 2004; Cabeza et al., 2012; Chein and Schneider, 2012; Dodds et al., 2011; Miller and Cohen, 2001; Nelson et al., 2010; Schacter et al., 2012; Seeley et al., 2007;  Spreng, 2012; Spreng and Grady, 2010; Vincent et al., 2008; Whitman et al., 2013).  To compare false belief and counterfactual inferences, we presented stories in which location or content of the same object was switched in the absence of a protagonist, followed by a question about the content or location tailored to each condition (see Appendix A). As a control condition, we included a basic conditional reasoning task that did not require the simulation of an alternative representation, as participants had to answer a reality-based question based on the (last) object's location or content (see also Rafetseder and Perner, 2010; Rafetseder et al., 2013). This basic conditional reasoning condition controls for a possible confound present in many previous studies measuring counterfactual reasoning, where answers to the counterfactual questions can be inferred by basic conditional reasoning alone. To illustrate, participants in a recent study were asked: “The motor is switched off today. If the motor had been switched on today,… would it have burned fuel?” (Kulakova et al., 2013, p. 267). To answer this question participants don't need to know what the actual situation is, only the general rule that a running motor burns fuel. The current study addresses this issue by ensuring that participants can only answer the counterfactual question correctly by reasoning counterfactually about the speciﬁc story and not by applying a general rule.  We hypothesize that all three conditions – which require the representation of goal-directed action by human protagonists – engage the mentalizing network (e.g., Mar, 2011; Van Overwalle, 2009; Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009). In line with recent work on episodic counterfactual thinking (Van Hoeck et al., 2013) and on the inhibition of self-representations in false belief reasoning (Hartwright et al., 2012; Van der Meer et al., 2011) as described earlier, we further predict that mental simulation of false belief and counterfactuals requires additional cognitive control supported by an executive control network (e.g., Botvinick et al., 2004; Schacter et al., 2012; Spreng, 2012).  Given that the majority of the empirical evidence points to communalities, we do not expect major differences between false belief and counterfactuals. Nevertheless, for false beliefs, we might expect stronger involvement of the TPJ as part of the mentalizing network, in line with the widely accepted notion that this region has specialized involvement in belief reasoning (Saxe and Powell, 2006; Young et al., 2010). For counterfactuals, we might expect stronger activation in the lateral temporal lobe. Although this region is commonly engaged by different forms of mental simulations, studies indicate it is stronger engaged while simulating a new or possible event, in contrast to a factual event (e.g., Addis et al., 2007, 2009; De Brigard et al., 2013; Nieuwland, 2012; Van Hoeck et al., 2013). This may additionally trigger activation in the lateral temporal lobe due to incorporating semantic knowledge into the construction of a novel/hypothetical event (Irish et al., 2012; Schacter et al., 2012; Viard et al., 2011).  Material and methods  Participants  Twenty healthy, right-handed adults (four males and sixteen females, Mage = 22 years, range = 19–29 years) who did not report a prior history of neurological or psychiatric impairment participated in the study. One participant was removed from analysis because of anatomical irregularities. All participants were native Dutch speakers who had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They gave written informed consent, in a manner approved by the Medical Ethics Committee at the Hospital of University of Gent and the Free University of Brussels, and were paid 10 euro for their participation.  Stimuli  Participants read vignettes in which the object's content or location was switched in the absence of a protagonist. To illustrate, one of the  N. Van Hoeck et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 315–325  317  vignettes describes how Jonas moves his wallet from his trousers to the windowsill, to be then moved again in Jonas' absence by Marion to the kitchen table after paying for pizzas. Next, questions were asked about the object's location or content: during false beliefs — the location expected by the absent protagonist (e.g., where Jonas expects his wallet to be if/when he returns?); during counterfactuals — the location if one of the protagonists had acted differently (e.g., where Jonas' wallet would be, if he had laid out money for pizzas); during basic conditional reasoning — a reality-based question on the last location (see also Appendix A).  The structure and the content of all the stimulus material were carefully controlled. The same 24 short social vignettes were used for all three conditions. Twelve vignettes portrayed the story of an agent changing an object's location while another agent was absent, and the other twelve vignettes described an agent changing an object's content while the other agent was absent. Agent's gender was also balanced across the vignettes. Every vignette was 40 words long and encompassed 3 sentences; a different object location or content in each sentence.  These vignettes were followed by a question tailored to each condition. The false belief and counterfactual questions (experimental conditions) were always 14 words long and the basic conditional questions (control condition) 11 words long. Each question had a similar “If …, then …” structure in the subjunctive past tense (counterfactual condition) or indicative present tense (false belief & basic conditional condition). The ﬁrst part of the question referred to an action (the ﬁrst agent returning or one of the agents acting counterfactually). The second part of the question asked for the (expected) location or content of the object. All the questions were phrased in an afﬁrmative way (no negations). The three different object locations or contents in each vignette ensured that participants needed to reason about each speciﬁc vignette and question to infer the correct answer.  Procedure  Immediately prior to scanning, the Delis–Kaplan Color–Word Inference Test was administered (Delis et al., 2006). Aside from basic components like color and word naming, it assess response  inhibition capacities (naming the ink color and not the word) and cognitive ﬂexibility (switching between naming the color and naming the word).  During the structural scanning, participants received written instructions about the experiment. They ﬁrst completed a practice session, so that they were familiar with the different types of tasks and with the response box. The experiment itself included just one run. All stimuli were presented in black text on a white background and projected on a screen viewed by participants on a mirror incorporated into the head-coil. E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) was used for the presentation and timing of stimuli.  Twenty four False Belief, 24 Counterfactual Reasoning, and 24 Basic Conditional reasoning trials (3 conditions × 24 vignettes = 72 trials) were presented across the entire scanning session. Each trial (see Fig. 1) started with a ﬁxation cross (duration = 2 s) followed by a vignette (self-paced). Participants pressed a button on the response box when they ﬁnished reading the vignette. Another ﬁxation cross appeared (jittered between 1 and 4 s), this time followed by a question (self-paced). Participants were explicitly instructed only to press a button once they knew the answer to the question. After a third ﬁxation cross (jittered between 1 and 4 s), three answering options (self-paced) were presented. Participants pressed the button that corresponded to their answer. A fourth ﬁxation cross (duration = 0.5 s) preceded a difﬁculty rating scale (not difﬁcult–slightly difﬁcult–difﬁcult–very difﬁcult).  The question-phase of each trial was the critical phase that differed between conditions. The speciﬁc question was depended on the condition (see Appendix A), while all other trial phases were the same for each condition. During the false belief trials, participants had to answer questions concerning the false belief of the ﬁrst agent (who was not aware of the change of location or content of an object). Participants had to reason where this agent expected an object was located or what the content of an object was. During the counterfactual trials, participants were required to reason where an object would be located or what the content of an object would be if one of the agents had acted differently. The basic conditional questions asked the participants where the object is located or what the content of the object is when the ﬁrst agent returns.  Fig. 1. Design.  318  N. Van Hoeck et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 315–325  Since we had 12 change-of-location and 12 change-of-content vignettes, repeated for each of the 3 conditions, we pseudo-randomized the order of the trials. The 72 trials were split into 3 consecutive blocks of 24 trials, with the order of the 3 blocks being pseudo-randomized. Speciﬁcally, the same vignette was never repeated within one block of 24 trials and there were at least 12 trials between repetitions of the same vignette (in the following block). Each block contained the same amount of trials for each condition (3 conditions × 9 trials = 24 trials/block). Half (4 or 5) of the 9 condition-trials in each block contained a change-of-location vignette and the remaining trials, a change-of-content vignette. In addition, half of the counterfactual questions referred to the agent who was not aware of the change of location/ content, while in the remaining trials the counterfactual questions referred to the other agent (who had changed the location/content).  During the last 2 min (approximate) of scanning we included a reading localizer baseline task, adapted from Pinel et al. (2007). Participants were instructed to read 15 sentences, each containing between 5 and 8 words and not referring to any mentalizing or causal content. Once participant had read a sentence they were required to press a button, which was followed by a ﬁxation cross (jittered between 1 and 4 s). Post scanning, participants' working memory was assessed by the Reading Span test (Van den Noort et al., 2008). Due to technical difﬁculties (i.e., participants sometimes pressed the response button too early during stimulus presentation, resulting in the automatic skipping of this trial), this measure was compromised and not included in the analyses.  Imaging procedure  Images were collected with a 3 Tesla Magnetom Trio MRI scanner system (Siemens medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany), using an 8-channel radiofrequency head coil. Stimuli were projected onto a screen at the end of the magnet bore that participants viewed by way of a mirror mounted on the head coil. Stimulus presentation was controlled by E-Prime 2.0 (www.pstnet.com/eprime; Psychology Software Tools) under Windows XP. Foam cushions were placed within the head coil to minimize head movements. We ﬁrst collected a high-resolution T1-weighted structural scan (MP-RAGE) followed by one functional run of 922 volume acquisitions (30 axial slices; 4 mm thick; 1 mm skip). Functional scanning used a gradient-echo echoplanar pulse sequence (Repetition Time (TR) = 2 s; Echo-Time (TE) = 33 mm; 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm × 4.0 mm resolution).  Image processing and statistical analysis  The fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping; The Wellcome Trust Centre for NeuroImaging, London, UK). For each functional run, data were preprocessed to remove sources of noise and artifact. Functional data were corrected for differences in acquisition time between slices for each whole-brain volume, realigned within and across runs to correct for head movement, and co-registered with each participant's anatomical data. Functional data were then transformed into a standard anatomical space (2 mm isotropic voxels) based on the ICBM 152 brain template (Montreal Neurological Institute), which approximates Talairach and Tournoux atlas space. Normalized data were then spatially smoothed (6 mm fullwidth-at-half-maximum [FWHM]) using a Gaussian kernel. Finally, realigned data were examined, using the Artifact Detection Tool software package (ART; www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect), for excessive motion artifacts and for correlations between motion or global mean signal and any of the conditions. Outliers where identiﬁed in the temporal difference series by assessing between scan differences (Z-threshold: 3.0, scan to scan movement threshold: 0.5 mm; rotation threshold: 0.02 radians). These outliers were omitted in the analysis by including a single regressor for each outlier. None of the participants had N10% outliers. No correlations between motion and experimental design or global signal and experimental design were identiﬁed.  Statistical analyses involved a ﬁrst-level single participant mixed epoch-related design, modeled using a canonical hemodynamic response function (GLM). We used a default high-pass ﬁlter of 128, and serial correlations were accounted for by the default autoregressive AR(1) model. The design included a regressor for each condition timelocked at the presentation of the question (duration set to individual duration of each question-phase), with the movement and nuisance artifact regressors, and the other trial-phases as regressors of no-interest. At second-level, we computed several random effect general linear models. A peak-based statistical threshold of p ≤ 0.001 (uncorrected) was used for all comparisons. In a ﬁrst model, statistical comparisons between conditions were computed using a one-way withinparticipants analysis of variance (ANOVA with one factor and four levels) on the parameter estimates associated with each trial type. In addition, we computed two conjunction analysis, one combining the contrasts of all conditions N reading baseline (i.e., false belief N reading localizer, counterfactual N reading localizer and basic conditional N reading localizer) and one combining the two contrasts of the experimental N control conditions (i.e., false belief N basic conditional and counterfactual N basic conditional).  To estimate the covariation between executive functioning and activity in the two experimental conditions, in a second model, we conducted two One Sample T-tests with the false belief N basic conditional contrast parameter (generated at the 1st level) and one executive function covariate (single score per participant) for each T-test, and similar two One Sample T-tests with the counterfactual N basic conditional contrast parameter. We tested two executive function covariates at a time: response inhibition (the scaled contrast score of Condition 3– Condition 1 of the Delis–Kaplan Word–Color Inference Task), and cognitive ﬂexibility (the scaled contrast score of Condition 4–Condition 3 in the Delis–Kaplan Word–Color Inference Task). The resulting parameter estimate represents the magnitude of correlation between task-speciﬁc activations and the participant-speciﬁc covariate measure.  We report statistical comparisons after correction for multiple comparisons using the non-parametric test statistic developed by Slotnick et al. (2003). This procedure enforces a cluster extent threshold by Monte-Carlo simulations of fMRI activation of the entire functional image matrix (64 × 64 × 30 voxels), assuming a corrected type I error voxel activation probability of 0.05 and smoothing with a 3D 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. After 2000 simulations, to yield a corrected p b 0.05, the cluster extent was determined at 31 contiguous resampled voxels. We also report which of these clusters were signiﬁcant after FDR correction at cluster level (p b 0.05) and at peak level (p b 0.05).  Results  Behavioral results  A one way within-participant ANOVA with the total accurate answers per condition conﬁrmed that the participant's accuracy did not signiﬁcantly differ between conditions (F(2, 36) = .66, p = .52).1 This is not surprising since the average accuracy in each condition is almost perfect (counterfactual: M = 23.11, SD = .22; false belief: M = 23.11, SD = .24; basic conditional: M = 23.37, SD = .21) and  1 As has been pointed out by Dixon (2008), the assumption of normality (in ANOVA) might often not be met when dealing with proportions, especially when accuracy percentages reach ceiling levels (as is the case here). Moreover, standard errors for effect estimates in within-subject designs tend to be inﬂated when subject variability is high (Dixon, 2008). As this limitation illustrates the lack of power of traditional repeated measures ANOVAs compared to more modern methods such as generalized linear mixedeffect models (Dixon, 2008; Jaeger, 2008), the latter modeling approach was additionally adopted in order to provide an analysis that is more sensitive to potential condition effects. A mixed logit model with a main effect for condition and random intercepts for subjects and items (Baayen et al., 2008) was ﬁt, but did not reveal any signiﬁcant differences in accuracy between conditions, χ2(2, N = 19) = 1.22, p = 0.54.  N. Van Hoeck et al. / NeuroImage 90 (2014) 315–325  319  the questions are perceived as easy (overall median = 1 = not difﬁcult) in all the conditions.  The average Question-phase duration (i.e., time to read the question and infer the answer in seconds; counterfactual: M = 4.72, SD = 1.80; false belief: M = 4.4, SD = 1.92; basic conditional: M = 3.73, SD = 1.51) differed however signiﬁcantly between conditions (one way within-participant ANOVA, F(2, 36) = 17.96, p b .001). Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected) indicated that the duration of the basic conditional question-phase was signiﬁcantly shorter than the false belief and counterfactual question-phase (p b .001). The reaction time of the false belief and counterfactual question did not differ significantly (p = .104). Aside from the fact that the basic conditional question is 2 words shorter, the shorter response time might be due also to the fact that the reasoning process in the basic conditional condition does not require the simulation and/or manipulation of two state-ofaffairs (contrary to the other two conditions), which is supported by language research comparing statements about facts (i.e., indicative mood) versus counterfactual possibilities (i.e., subjunctive mood) (Ferguson, 2012; Santamarı et al., 2005). However, none of the executive function measures (Inhibition: M = 11.84, SD = 2.58; Switching: M = 10.37, SD = 2.41) or the difﬁculty scores correlate signiﬁcantly with the duration of the question-phase in any of the conditions.  fMRI results  Overlap between false belief, counterfactual and basic conditional reasoning To estimate the activations common to all three experimental conditions, we computed a conjunction analysis including the false belief N reading localizer, counterfactual N reading localizer and basic conditional N reading localizer contrasts (Table 1 & Fig. 2). The results demonstrate that, as predicted, all three conditions activate regions from the mentalizing network (precuneus and left TPJ) and the executive control network (bilateral PFC, dACC & right IPL). There are a number of additional regions which may reﬂect increased semantic processing (middle temporal gyrus) as well as increased mental imagery (lingual gyrus, cuneus, left occipital gyrus), perhaps due to the emphasis on the change of locations/contents described in the vignettes in comparison with mere reading (e.g., Kulakova et al., 2013; Spreng et al., 2009).  Overlap between false belief and counterfactual in contrast to conditional reasoning  We next estimated the overlap between the two experimental conditions in comparison with basic conditional reasoning from reality, by computing the conjunction of false belief N basic conditional and counterfactual N basic conditional contrasts (Table 1 & Fig. 2). In support of the prediction that the simulation of an alternative (mental) representation away from reality requires executive processing, the conjunction shows activation of the left IPL. There was additional activation in the occipital cortex (left middle occipital gyrus & cuneus) again pointing to the possibility of increased mental imagery.  False beliefs and counterfactuals  Separate contrasts comparing the two belief conditions each against the basic conditional condition (Table 1 & Fig. 3) conﬁrm the results from the conjunction. Interestingly, they further reveal that both false beliefs and counterfactuals activate the dorsolateral PFC from the executive control network, with counterfactuals more robustly than false beliefs. Counterfactuals, but not false beliefs, activated additional regions from the executive network (pmFC & right IPL, and the mentalizing network (dorsal mPFC). There was also activation in the right cerebellum. More importantly, conﬁrming our prediction, counterfactuals recruited the left inferior temporal gyrus implicated in semantic processing.  We then compared the two experimental conditions directly. A counterfactual N false belief contrast conﬁrmed our prediction of greater activation during counterfactuals in the left temporal cortex (semantic  processing), and further revealed stronger activation in the dorsolateral PFC from the executive network (Table 1 & Fig. 3). The opposite false belief N counterfactual comparison did not yield any results. Taken together, this is generally consistent with our hypothesis that differences between the two conditions are rather limited. However, counterfactual reasoning engaged executive control and semantic processes to a larger extent.  Post-hoc we also regrouped the counterfactual trials into a Change of Location condition (12 trials) and a Change of Content condition (12 trials). One can assume that during a Counterfactual Change of Location (“where”) requires more visual-spatial processing (scene reconstruction) than Counterfactual Change of Content (“what”). Results of a one-way within-participant ANOVA seem to support this (Table 2). The Counterfactual Change of Location condition activated the posterior regions supporting the process of mentally generating and maintaining a complex and coherent scene: bilateral parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, left precuneus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule and middle occipital gyrus. The Counterfactual Change of Content revealed activity in the left anterior cingulate, left SMA & middle cingulate cortex, and left postcentral gyrus. These regions have been linked to control process (inhibition and managing multiple representations) during counterfactual comprehension (Urrutia et al., 2012; see also next heading).  Parametric analysis of executive processes  With respect to executive control, the parametric analysis of the false belief N basic conditional contrast (Tables 3 & 4) revealed a positive correlation between the Inhibition measure and areas of the executive network (lateral PFC and right IPL) as well as the right superior temporal gyrus. The lateral PFC was also correlated negatively with the Flexibility measure.  The parametric analysis of the counterfactual N basic conditional contrast (Tables 3 & 4) showed a positive correlation with the Inhibition measure and negative correlation with Flexibility measures in a plethora of regions, including regions of the executive (lateral PFC, IPL) and mentalizing (right TPJ) networks.  Discussion  On a daily basis we make inferences about states that are not directly observable in the external world, like false belief reasoning (inferring an agent's false belief about an object's location or content) and counterfactual reasoning (inferring what the location or content of object would be if an agent had acted differently). Developmental, cognitive and neurological studies all indicate that false belief and counterfactual reasoning are related to each other. However, until present no functional MRI had investigated their common and distinct brain regions. The current study compared the neural underpinnings of these two types of reasoning processes in a social environment and contrasted this to basic conditional reasoning (inferring what the [current] object's location or content is).  This study conﬁrms that false belief, counterfactual and basic conditional reasoning, in contrast to reading, engage processes supporting goal-directed mental simulations in a social context: mentalizing (left TPJ & precuneus) and executive control functions (bilateral PFC & right IPL). We also found increased activation in regions related to mental imagery (lingual gyrus, cuneus, left occipital gyrus) and semantic processing (bilateral middle temporal gyrus). Although not predicted, this increased engagement of simulation processes (Kulakova et al., 2013; Spreng et al., 2009) is understandable because it is most probably due to the emphasis in our vignettes on changes in locations/contents in contrast to our reading localizer which measures general reading processes. In summary, the results of this study provide neurological support for the notion that false belief, counterfactual and basic conditional reasoning in a social context rely on representing the relevant components of the situation (generating a mental representation) and executive processes that control the generation of such representation.  Table 1 Whole brain analysis.  dmPFC pmFC Left dlPFC Left vlPFC Right vlPFC Left dACC Left temporal pole Left inferior temporal gyrus Left fusiform gyrus Left middle temporal gyrus  Right middle temporal gyrus Left temporo-parietal junction Left inferior parietal lobe Right inferior parietal lobe Precuneus Lingual Gyrus & Cuneus Cuneus/calcarine gyrus Left middle occipital gyrus Left inferior occipital gyrus Right cerebellum  False belief (FB) N basic conditional (BC)  Counterfactual (CF) N basic conditional  Conjunction: FB N BC + CF N BC  Counterfactual N false belief  Conjunction: FB N RL + CF N RL + BC N RL  x  y  z  T  Voxels  x  y  z  T  Voxels  x  y  z  T  Voxels  x  y  z  T  Voxels  x  y  z  T  Voxels  −20  34  40  4.00  38  −4 −14 −38  50 28 30  48 58 46  5.58ab 4.38 3.94  378 98 36  −50 −14 −26  4.77  128  −50 −68  42  3.95  67  14 −92  −20 −98  0  8  4.11b  271  5.73ab  498  −52 −62 54 −62  16 −92 −20 −98  42 38  10 8  4.98b 3.98  5.35 ab 7.17ab  28 −82 −32  3.68  356 145  653 929  58  −50 −68  42  3.95  64  16 −92 −20 −98  2 8  4.07b 5.73ab  242 487  −38  30  46  5.81a  44  −40  16 −26  −34 −38 −20 −54 −54 2  4.05  4.86 4.22  77  60 54  −38 −40 42 −6  4 24 24 14  52 26 26 50  6.38ab 5.23ab 4.11 4.35  1597c 1597c 189 92  −48 −24 −16 −52 −42 0 54 −10 −18 18  −48 −54  36 −66 −4 −64 14 −90 −10 −94  44 50 −6 −8  3.98 4.26 5.05 4.72b  4.67 8.42ab 6.06ab 6.67ab  40 167 177 370  194 3949 257 437c  −22 −90 −10  5.87ab  437c  Coordinates in the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) stereotactic space of the peak voxel within each cluster as indicated by the highest T-score.

When we compare false belief and counterfactual reasoning against basic conditional reasoning, we further detected increased activity in the executive control network (dorsolateral PFC and IPL; e.g., Barbey et al., 2012; Schacter et al., 2012; Spreng, 2012), although not always in the same cluster or hemisphere. This increased activity conﬁrms our prediction that false belief as well as counterfactual inferences, in comparison to basic conditional inferences, relies heavier on executive processes recruited by the integration and control of cognitive representations. Furthermore, the covariation analysis demonstrated that several executive regions in the frontal and parietal lobule correlated positively with false belief activations, and even more so with counterfactual activations.  This study was not able to provide support for a specialized role of the right temporo-parietal junction (TJP) in reasoning about other people's beliefs (e.g., Saxe and Powell, 2006; Young et al., 2010). We did not observe stronger activation of the right TPJ during false belief reasoning in comparison with the other conditions. We did ﬁnd left TPJ activation in the conjunction of the three conditions compared to general reading. This conﬁrms the major tenet that the TPJ is essentially involved in social cognition (see meta-analyses by Kubit and Jack, 2013; Mar, 2011; Mars et al., 2012).  An important contribution of the current study is that it suggests that counterfactual reasoning about adding an alternative action to a social scenario is a more complex process than false belief reasoning. First, during counterfactual reasoning, we observed stronger activation of the dorsomedial PFC, a mentalizing region supporting the formation of higher construals, that is, abstractions away from the observable reality (Baetens et al., 2013). Second, in line with our previous study (Van Hoeck et al., 2013), the left dorsal lateral PFC (i.e., executive control network) and the left temporal cortex (i.e., semantic processing) were also stronger activated. Knight and Grabowecky (1995) describe a patient with damage in the dorsolateral PFC whose most marked behavior was a “complete absence of counterfactual expression” (p. 1367). They suggest that impairments in this region lead to deﬁcits in simulation and reality monitoring. Combined with the left temporal cortex, it seems to assist in the generation and integration of elements in a detailed  counterfactual representation (Holland et al., 2011; Summerﬁeld et al., 2010). Third, unlike false belief activations, numerous counterfactual task-dependent activations in the frontal and parietal lobule (executive control network) correlated with behavioral measures of executive control reﬂecting response inhibition and cognitive ﬂexibility. Fourth, there was also enhanced recruitment of the posterior cerebellum. This is in accordance with recent work on episodic counterfactual thinking (Van Hoeck et al., 2013) and a recent review by Van Overwalle and coworkers (Van Overwalle et al., 2013) demonstrating that cerebellar activity increases when there is greater complexity and abstraction in social cognitive judgments. The cerebellum, presumably serves a domaingeneral cognitive function in the support of executive and semantic processes in complex higher social cognition.  We extensively controlled the materials of the tasks (see method section), and the average difﬁculty rating, accuracy and time needed to infer the answer did not differ signiﬁcantly between the false belief and counterfactual reasoning task. Consequently, this study indicates that the simulation of an additive counterfactual social representation (entailing adding a new element to the scenario; versus subtractive counterfactuals, which remove an element from the scenario) is indeed more complex than simulating a false belief representation. To answer a false belief question correctly, one has to simulate a second representation (while the ﬁrst one represents reality), which only needs to represent the object's location or content right before the protagonist left the scene. However, answering our counterfactual question correctly requires inferring which change in location or content was likely to have been canceled out because of the counterfactual action, which can only be inferred by representing all the components of each speciﬁc vignette and question and additional causal reasoning (longer inference length). This is surprisingly analogous to the processes associated with the role of semantic (temporal lobe), executive (PFC & IPL) and mentalizing regions (dmPFC) during self-reﬂective autobiographical reasoning (i.e., extracting meaning and integrating conceptual knowledge) that goes beyond mere autobiographical retrieval (D'Argembeau et al., 2013). Therefore, the present study indicates that creating speciﬁc and detailed counterfactual representations requires additional cognitive  322  N.

This also supports the recent developmental ﬁndings suggesting that counterfactual skills develop later than false belief, between the age of 6 and 12 (Rafetseder et al., 2010, 2013). However, future research should investigate if the  difference in inference length is indeed inherent to counterfactual versus false belief reasoning, which otherwise limits the interpretation of the results. Additionally, we cannot rule out that linguistic differences add to the complexity of the reasoning process in counterfactual  Table 2 Counterfactual Change of Location versus Change of Content.

Even though all Dutch questions had the same “Als … [antentedent], dan … [consequent].” structure, the “als” could have had two meanings in the false belief and basic conditional conditions. The questions in these conditions were formulated in the indicative present mood (e.g. “If A is B, what is C?”; see Appendix A) and thus this “als” could have been interpreted as a conditional expression (“if”) or a temporal expression (“when”); we cannot rule out either. Regardless, in both these conditions the antecedent reﬂects a factual action (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). The counterfactual questions on the other hand were formulated in the subjunctive past mood (e.g., “If A had been B, what would C be?”, see Appendix A), thus involving a conditional “if” which doesn't reﬂect a factual action but an action that is imagined, but never took place. Moreover, the use of additive versus subtractive (negations) counterfactuals might also have contributed to the complexity of the reasoning process. In addition, unlike counterfactuals, it might be the case that participants processed the false belief automatically during the vignette phase and kept this online to answer a possible false belief question afterwards (Apperly et al., 2006; Kovács et al., 2010). Future research should investigate this further.  We did not detect activation of the hippocampus frequently observed during autobiographical simulation. This is not surprising,  because the lack of activity in many memory-related regions was predicted by the fact that the simulation process in all these three conditions did not require retrieving or recombining personal relevant information; instead information was presented in impersonal vignettes that were readily available to the participants (e.g., Addis and Schacter, 2012). Previous neurological studies conﬁrm that not all false belief and counterfactual tasks necessarily require hippocampus involvement (Kulakova et al., 2013; Nieuwland, 2012; Rabin et al., 2012; Urrutia et al., 2012; Van Hoeck et al., 2013). In addition, the post-hoc analysis of Counterfactual Change of Location (i.e., altering the ‘where’) versus Counterfactual Change of Content (i.e., altering the ‘what’) supports the idea that not all types of counterfactual reasoning require the same amount of scene (re)construction.  Conclusion  The current research indicates that false belief, counterfactual and basic conditional reasoning engages regions supporting mentalizing, executive control, and mental imagery. It also provides support for the notion that false belief and counterfactual reasoning both entail generating an additional internal representation, depicting the other person's  Table 4 Covariate analysis: negative correlation.  dmPFC  dlPFC Right middle cingulate cortex Right posterior cingulate cortex Right paracentral lobule Right middle temporal gyrus  Precuneus  Right temporo-parietal junction Left middle occipital gyrus/temporal gyrus  Cognitive ﬂexibility  False belief N basic conditional  x  46  y  26  z  44  T  Voxels  4.91  36  Counterfactual N basic conditional  x  14 2 44 4 6 6 58 34 2 −14 62 −36  y  60 48 26 −4 −36 −34 −66 −66 −50 −54 −56 −70  z  26 26 40 30 22 64 −2 16 38 36 24 22  T  4.29 4.83 4.27 4.94 4.56 4.60 5.68 4.94 5.28b 4.69 6.30 5.29  Voxels  32 33 32 69 50 76 53 138 418 33 239 203  Coordinates in the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) stereotactic space of the peak voxel within each cluster as indicated by the highest T-score.

In other words, thinking about the expectations of another person or about how an event could have turned out if something had changed, requires us to simulate a second representation, aside from representing the true state of affairs (basic conditional reasoning). This requires stronger engagement of neural regions supporting the integration of cognitive representations (left inferior parietal lobe & lateral prefrontal cortex) and mental imagery (occipital cortex). In contrast to false belief reasoning, the generation and integration of elements in a detailed counterfactual representation involves additional engagement of the dorsomedial and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the cerebellum and the left temporal lobe. This suggests that counterfactual reasoning reﬂects a higher level, more complex and abstract cognitive process, recruiting a more extensive network of brain activation.

Although it was not explicitly formulated in the story participants might have assumed that if Jonas had laid out money for the pizzas he would have put his wallet back into his jacket instead of the windowsill. This possible confusion increased then the complexity of this question. The mean response latency (time needed to infer the answer in the question phase) of the counterfactual condition in this particular story indeed exceeds 2 (not 3) standard deviations from the overall mean response latency for the counterfactual condition. A closer inspection of the data informs us that this is due to a longer response latency of three subjects. The mean response latency of the counterfactual condition in the other stories did not exceed 2 standard deviations. We could neither detect in these stories the possibility of assuming two correct answers.  Barbey, A.K., Colom, R., Solomon, J., Krueger, F., Forbes, C., Grafman, J., 2012.

However, ethological studies reported state-dependent strategy optimization irrespective of individual preference. To synthesize the two contrasting literatures, we developed a novel gambling task that dynamically manipulated the quota severity (required outcome to clear the task) in a course of choice trials and conducted a task-fMRI study in human participants. The participants showed their individual risk preference when they had no quota constraint (‘individual-preference mode’), while they adopted state-dependent optimal strategy when they needed to achieve a quota (‘strategy-optimization mode’). fMRI analyses illustrated that the interplay among prefrontal areas and salience-network areas reﬂected the quota severity and the utilization of the optimal strategy, shedding light on the neural substrates of the quota-dependent risk attitude. Our results demonstrated the complex nature of risk-sensitive decision-making and may provide a new perspective for the understanding of problematic risky behaviors in human.  © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Risk attitude is one of the critical factors that intensely bias one's decision-making. Although numerous studies have examined the decision-making process associated with risk (i.e., variance of potential outcome), how an individual arranges his/her risk attitude has remained elusive.  Past studies claimed two contrasting perspectives regarding risk attitude. A large body of neuroscience, psychology, and economics studies has considered risk attitude as a static parameter that is implemented in the individual brain (Huettel et al., 2006; Tobler et al., 2009; Symmonds et al., 2011; Takahashi, 2012). From this ‘individual-preference’ view, a person taking risky options frequently was regarded as a risk-prone individual, whereas a person who tended to avoid risky choices was classiﬁed as a risk-averse individual. On the other hand, ethological studies reported a systematic change of risk attitude associated with the internal resource state, such as hunger (Caraco et al., 1980; Stephens and Krebs, 1986, St Onge and Floresco, 2009, Inagaki et al., 2014). In line with this ‘strategy optimization’ view, an individual needing to satisfy a resource shortage strategically takes risky options irrespective of individual preference. Although the respective ‘individual preference’ aspect and ‘strategy optimization’ aspect concerning risk attitude were investigated and conﬁrmed separately, just how these two views are integrated remains poorly understood.  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Psychiatry, Kyoto University Graduate School  of Medicine, 54 Shogoin-Kawara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.

We assumed that the ‘quota severity’ concept could be of help for this issue. Imagine that you are the coach of a soccer team and you need to decide on a game strategy. When your team plays a fun match (i.e., the result is immaterial), you can apply a favorite strategy based on your individual risk preference, because your team has no quota constraint. On the other hand, when your team plays a tournament game (i.e., winning the game is essential), you need to optimally utilize an expected-value-based strategy (e.g., strengthening the defense) and risky strategy (e.g., increasing the number of attackers) depending on the quota severity (i.e., number of goals needed to win) in order to maximize the chance to win. This example implies that the human agent ﬂexibly utilizes two types of risk attitudes (i.e., ‘individual-preference mode’ and ‘strategy-optimization mode’) depending on the quota severity in real-life situations.  Several brain structures have been implicated in risk-related decisionmaking. The ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is known to mediate encoding of subjective value (Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Euston et al., 2012; Levy and Glimcher, 2012), and its dysfunction leads to the deﬁcit of economic decision-making (Bechara et al., 1997; Rushworth et al., 2011). The striatum has been also known to encode reward signal and is emphasized in value-based decision-making (O'Doherty, 2004; Schultz, 2015). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI), which have been referred to, by reﬂecting subjective arousal, as the ‘salience network’ (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004; Craig, 2009; Singer et al., 2009; Eisenberger, 2012), were also implicated in human risk-sensitive decision-making (Preuschoff et al., 2008; Christopoulos et al., 2009). These structures thus could play a crucial role during risk-related decision-making under quota. We also expected the involvement of the  A. Fujimoto, H. Takahashi / NeuroImage 139 (2016) 304–312  305  dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which has been implicated in cognitive ﬂexibility (Milner, 1963; Wallis et al., 2001; Buckley et al., 2009), because further ﬂexibility would be required to utilize multiple types of risk attitudes.  In this study, we performed an fMRI experiment with a novel gambling task that requires participants to solve a quota (required units to clear a task), to investigate the neural substrates of ﬂexible utilization of risk attitude depending on the quota severity. Because the accompanying activation of dlPFC and other areas such as dACC has been reported in a variety of cognitive tasks including decision-making tasks (Duncan, 2010, 2013), we focused not only on the activation level but also the functional-connectivity level and aimed to elucidate how the interplay of brain areas serves to utilize ‘individual-preference mode’ and ‘strategy-optimization mode’.  Materials and methods  Participants  Twenty-nine task-naive participants (all male, aged 20–54 years, mean ± SD = 30.9 ± 10.4 years, 27 right-handed) participated in the current study. None of them had a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders according to a pre-interview based on DSM-IV-TR. We tested only male participants in order to use the same data set in a study of  gambling disorder, which is highly prevalent in the male population (Shaffer and Martin, 2011). All participants provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the Committee on Medical Ethics of Kyoto University and was carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association.  Task and procedure  A gambling task (Goal-Instructed Gambling task: GIG task) was developed to examine human decision-making under dynamically changing quota (Fig. 1A). In each block of this task, participants went through 20 successive gambling choices between a risky option (high magnitude and low winning probability) and a safe option (low magnitude and high winning probability) to solve a ‘block quota’ of each block. The block quota was randomly assigned to each block from 7 levels (1000–7000 units) so that participants experienced a broad range of trial-by-trial quota severity (‘trial quota’: remaining units divided by remaining trial numbers) in a single session (Fig. 1B and C). Participants pursued 7 blocks in each session, and the block result (clear or failure) was given after the end of each block. Participants were paid uniformly for their participation and were encouraged to solve all 7 blocks.  A session (16 min, 20 trials × 7 blocks, 140 choice trials) was started with block-quota instructions on the monitor. First, participants were required to move the cursor (right or left button press) to enter the  Fig. 1. Task and an example session sequence. (A) An illustration of the GIG task. After block-quota instructions, participants went through 20 choices between a risky option and a safe option in order to solve the block quota. Trial quota (units/trial) was released at the end of every trial as feedback. At the end of a block, the block result (clear or failure) was released, and then the next block was begun.

The simulation result was used to deﬁne ﬁve quota conditions (Non, Easy, Low, High, Imp) for subsequent behavioral and neuronal analyses.  Five quota conditions  Based on the simulation results, ﬁve quota conditions were deﬁned: (1) Non-quota condition (0 units/trial), (2) Easy-quota condition (0– 131 units/trial), (3) Low-quota condition (131–310 units/trial), (4) High-quota condition (310–600 units/trial), (5) Imp-quota (impossible quota) condition (N600 units/trial). The Non-quota condition contained trials after the block quota was cleared. For instance, if a participant achieved a block quota after the 17th trial in a block (each block contained 20 trials), the remaining 3 trials in the block were classiﬁed as Non-quota condition. In this condition, participants could exert choices without being concerned about the quota constraint. The Easy-quota condition was set below average acquired units of RAND model (131 units). Because of the extremely small quota setting, strategic choice was not required in this condition. Low-/High-quota conditions were set between the Easy- and Imp-quota conditions and were separated by the indifferent point of CP_IDX (310 units, Fig. 2B), at which optimal strategy was switched. As the simulation demonstrated, participants should employ the expected-value-based strategy in Low-quota condition and employ risky strategy in High-quota condition. Imp-quota condition was set above maximum pay-off for one trial (600 units), instructions for which were explicitly given to participants in advance of the experimental  subjective conﬁdence level (Level 0–10) to clear the ongoing block. This conﬁdence-rating procedure was introduced to explicitly remind participants of the block quota. After entering the conﬁdence level by pressing the shift key, a block was begun. Following the ﬁxation cross (1.0 sec), two gamble options (stimulus) appeared simultaneously at random locations (right or left). A risky option was composed of higher magnitude (400–600 units) and lower winning probability (20–40%), whereas a safe option consisted of lower magnitude (150–350 units) and higher winning probability (60–80%). With this setting, both a risky option and a safe option could yield higher expected-value: a safe option yielded higher expected-value in the case of 60%. The magnitude was indicated by the length of the yellow bar (0–600 units) and the winning probability by the width of the red part of the pie chart (0–100%). After a 2.5-sec period, the stimulus was extinguished and the GO signal (‘CHOICE’) appeared, requiring an immediate choice response (right or left button press). Feedback information (current gain, units remaining to achieve a block quota, remaining trial numbers in the block) was presented following the choice response in order to maintain awareness of the trial quota in every trial. Participants could accumulate units in ‘win’ trials, but not in ‘loss’ trials (0 units). After ﬁnishing 20 choices and receiving the block result (clear or failure), a new block with a renewed block quota was started. Each block was independent, and the result or earned units in a block were not transferred to the next block. The program of the behavioral task was constructed and presented using E-prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA) on a laptop computer (Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Participants completed two sessions (an fMRI session and an offscan session) of the GIG task, and the results obtained from the fMRI session were the main focus of analysis. In addition to the behavioral session, nineteen participants also completed the Domain-Speciﬁc Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale, in which trait risk attitude (expected beneﬁts from risky activities) for ﬁve categorical situations (ﬁnancial, health/safety, recreational, ethical, social) was assessed separately (Weber et al., 2002; Blais and Weber, 2006). The resulting DOSPERT score was used for correlation analysis to investigate the inﬂuence of individual risk preference in the choice pattern.  Computational simulation  Simulation and the following behavioral and fMRI analyses were  performed with MATLAB R2010a (MathWorks, Natick, MA).  Four computer-generated models (EV, RISKY, SAFE, RAND) performed 100,000 blocks (2,000,000 trials) of the GIG task. The EV model always took an option with higher expected-value, reﬂecting an expectedvalue-based strategy. The RISKY model always took a risky option (high magnitude and low winning probability), representing the risky-choice strategy. In a similar way, the SAFE model took a safe option (low magnitude and high winning probability) and the RAND model always made a random choice. For each model, average acquired units and maximum acquired units were calculated. Next, the block-clear probability of each model with various block quotas was calculated and converted into the ‘clear-performance index (CP_IDX)’. CP_IDX represented the relative dominance of the RISKY model over the EV model as follows:  f CP IDX ¼ CP RISKY f CP RISKY  ð ð  Þ Þ−CP RAND g− CP EVð Þ−CP RAND Þ g þ CP EVð  f f  ð ð  Þ Þ−CP RAND g g ; Þ−CP RAND Þ  ð ð  where CP(RISKY) and CP(EV) represented the block-clear probability of the RISKY model and EV model, respectively. The block-clear probability of the RAND model, CP(RAND), was used for subtracting from each of CP(RISKY) and CP(EV) for the sake of normalization. Negative index (−1 b CP_IDX b 0) meant higher block-clear probability of the EV model compared to that of the RISKY model, whereas positive index (0 b CP_IDX b 1) meant the opposite. We plotted the transition of CP_IDX against the block-quota severity and looked at the indifferent point at which the relative dominance between the RISKY and EV models  Fig. 2. Simulation results.

In Imp-quota condition, block failure was already determined, and therefore no optimal strategy was deﬁned.  fMRI functional-connectivity analysis  A. Fujimoto, H. Takahashi / NeuroImage 139 (2016) 304–312  307  Behavioral data analyses  For the ﬁve quota conditions, average risky-choice tendency (probability to take a risky option), average EV-based choice tendency (probability to take a higher expected-value option), and average RT were calculated and statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA. Individual differences in choice data were assessed as variance and shown as the fano factor (variance divided by mean of data). The variances of two quota conditions were compared by F-test. To assess the similarity of individual choice tendencies between two quota conditions, Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient was calculated for each pair of quota conditions, and the p-value was converted into a color map. The inﬂuence of the preceding trial result (pre-trial effect) was calculated by subtracting RT in post-loss trials from that in post-win trials and assessing the statistical signiﬁcance from the zero line by rank-sum test. We reasoned that a positive pre-trial effect indicated deliberate quota updating because the calculation process for updating the quota was more complex following a win trial (both trial number and remaining units changed) than that following a loss trial (only trial number changed).  fMRI data acquisition  The scanning sessions were conducted at the Kokoro Research Center (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) using a 3T scanner equipped with a 32channel head coil (Verio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Participants lay supine on the scanner bed with head mildly restrained, and they viewed the LED display via a built-in mirror on the head coil. Functional images were obtained in a T2*-weighted echo-planner imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 2500 ms; TE = 5.19 and 7.65 msec; ﬂip angle = 60°; FOV = 192 × 192 mm; matrix = 64 × 64; voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm). Anatomical images were obtained in a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence following the EPI session with identical scanning parameters. The ﬁrst two volumes were not saved to allow for signal stabilization.  fMRI activation analyses  The fMRI data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, UK) run on MATLAB. The images underwent realignment and slice-timing correction, were normalized to the template image in SPM8, and then smoothed with an 8-mm isotropic Gaussian kernel.  At the within-subject level, ﬁve regressors corresponding to the stimulus-onset time of the ﬁve quota conditions (Non, Easy, Low, High, Imp) were implemented in a single general linear-regression model (GLM). Motion parameters were also included in the same GLM as additional regressors of no interest. Correlation between the bold oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in each voxel and ﬁve single contrasts (Non: [1 0 0 0 0], Easy: [0 1 0 0 0], Low: [0 0 1 0 0], High: [0 0 0 1 0], Imp: [0 0 0 0 1]) were tested, respectively. Then, the resulting ﬁve contrast images for each subject were used in the group-level analysis, in which we tested ‘quota severity’ contrast ([0 −2 −1 1 2]), which corresponded to the strictness of quota (Easy b Low b High b Imp), using ANOVA. We used a combination of height threshold uncorrected p b 0.0001 and cluster-size threshold 26 voxels to ﬁnd signiﬁcant clusters (corrected for multiple comparisons, p b 0.05). Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using REST AlphaSim (Song et al., 2011), which computed the cluster-size threshold based on the Monte Carlo simulations in AFNI (Cox, 1996). We ran 5000 simulations while setting the cluster-connection radius at 5 mm, and FWHM at 8 mm. This estimated the cluster-size threshold at 26 voxels, corresponding to corrected p b 0.05.  The generalized form of the context-dependent psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) method was employed to examine task-dependent connectivity for each of the ﬁve quota conditions (McLaren et al., 2012). The gPPI method, a variant of the standard PPI method (Friston et al., 1997; Gitelman et al., 2003), allowed us to test the functional connectivity with more than two task conditions by spanning the total space of the experimental design (van Holst et al., 2012; McLaren et al., 2014).  At the within-subject level, we extracted the time course in each of the seed regions (6-mm spheres) that were identiﬁed by activation analysis (Fig. 4A–C: dACC [2 −4 48], left dlPFC [−26 36 30], right AI [36 8 −16]). Then, ﬁve PPI regressors were constructed from the time course of the seed regions convolved with the onset time of each quota condition and implemented in a single GLM with physiological regressor (BOLD) and psychological regressors (Quota conditions). Five single contrasts were tested, resulting in ﬁve contrast images for each participant. Subsequent group-level analyses were performed using ANOVA. To search for neural correlates of the utilization of strategy optimization and individual preference, we tested the ‘strategy-optimization’ contrast ([−1 0 1 1 −1]), corresponding to the Low/ High N Non/Imp contrasting, and the ‘individual-preference’ contrast ([1 0 −1 −1 1]), corresponding to the Non/Imp N Low/High contrasting, for the three seed regions (dACC, right AI, left dlPFC). We used a combination of height threshold uncorrected p b 0.01 and cluster-size threshold 237 voxels to ﬁnd signiﬁcant clusters (corrected for multiple comparisons, p b 0.05). The cluster-size threshold was computed by REST AlphaSim with identical setting to the activation analysis (iteration of simulation: 5000, cluster-connection radius: 5 mm, FWHM: 8 mm). To examine how the functional-connectivity pattern reﬂected the adequateness of behavioral performance, the correlation between the beta value extracted from the gPPI results and the behavioral data (risky-choice tendency and pre-trial effect) was analyzed.  Results  Computational simulation  Prior to the experiment with participants, a computational simulation was run in order to deﬁne the ﬁve ‘quota conditions’, the criteria used for behavioral and neuronal analyses. In the simulation, four computer-generated models (EV, RISKY, SAFE, RAND) played the GIG task (Fig. 1A), and performance of each model was recorded. When we calculated the average acquired units of each model, the EV model (expected-value-based choice model: always take a higher expectedvalue option) yielded the best score (Fig. 2A, main panel). However, when we calculated the maximum acquired units of each model, the RISKY model (risky-choice model: always take a risky option) showed a better score than the EV model, indicating dominance of risky choice when an agent needed to solve a higher quota (Fig. 2A, inset). The transition of clear-performance index (CP_IDX), which represented the relative dominance of RISKY model over EV model in terms of block-clear probability, revealed switching of optimal strategy when the trial quota reached 310 units/trial (Fig. 2B). This simulation indicated that an optimal agent would ﬂexibly utilize an expected-value-based strategy and a risky strategy through monitoring of the trial quota. Based on the simulation result and task settings, trials were classiﬁed into ﬁve quota conditions (Non: 0 units/trial, Easy: 0–131 units/trial, Low: 131–310 units/ trial, High: 310–600 units/trial, Imp: N600 units/trial). With this setting, only Low-/High-quota conditions entailed computationally optimal strategy (Low: expected-value-based strategy; High: risky-choice strategy). In other quota conditions (Non, Easy, Imp), no strategy affected the block result, and thereby no optimal strategy was deﬁned. For details of the simulation analysis and deﬁnition of the quota conditions, also see Materials and methods.  308  A. Fujimoto, H. Takahashi / NeuroImage 139 (2016) 304–312  Quota-dependent modulation of risk attitude  The participants (n = 29) experienced a broad range of trial quotas in an experimental session (Fig. 1B and C), and their behavioral performance in fMRI sessions was analyzed quantitatively (Fig. 3). As predicted by the simulation results, the participants dramatically changed their choice strategy depending on the quota conditions (risky choice: F(4,140) = 15, p b 0.001; EV-based choice: F(4,140) = 5.8, p b 0.001, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 3A and B). The average risky-choice probability (probability to select risky options) was highest in the Imp-quota condition (Fig. 3A), whereas the average EV-based choice probability (probability to select higher expected-value options) was highest in the Lowquota condition (Fig. 3B). The response time (RT) was not statistically different across quota conditions (F(4,140) = 0.77, p = 0.55, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 3C), ensuring that the quota-dependent change of choice strategy was not derived from a reﬂexive response or difference of motivation. The choice pattern in the secondary (off-scan) sessions appeared in the same manner as that in the fMRI sessions (risky choice: F(4,140) = 14, p b 0.001; EV-based choice: F(4,140) = 2.6, p = 0.036; RT: F(4,140) = 0.57, p = 0.68, one-way ANOVA), ensuring over-session consistency of the behavioral performance.  Strategy optimization and individual preference in choice patterns  Despite the prominent modulation pattern at the group level, individual choice patterns were not uniform (Fig. 3A, thin lines). Indeed, the variance of individual choice tendency was clearly different among quota conditions (Fig. 3D). Smaller variance in the Low-/High-quota conditions compared to other conditions indicated that the participants commonly shifted their choice strategy in Low-/High-quota conditions. This choice pattern was predicted by the simulation results (Fig. 2), and then we assumed that the participants exerted quota-dependent optimal strategy (‘strategy-optimization mode’) in these conditions. If this  assumption would hold true, we may observe evidence of careful monitoring of quota updating in the Low-/High-quota conditions. To test this, we investigated the preceding trial effect (pre-trial effect: RT difference between post-win trials and post-loss trials), because more deliberate monitoring of the quota might extend RT following win trials compared to loss trials (see Materials and methods). As expected, a signiﬁcant pre-trial effect was observed only in the Low-/High-quota conditions (Low: n = 29, p = 0.0082; High: n = 29, p = 0.0018, rank-sum test) (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the uniform choice pattern in the Low-/ High-quota conditions indeed emerged from the deliberate utilization of state-dependent optimal strategy.  Unlike this ‘strategy-optimization mode’ in the Low-/High-quota conditions, individual choice patterns were more diverse in other conditions (Fig. 3D). To investigate whether these diverse choice patterns were a signature of individual character or just random choice, we investigated the inter-condition correlation of the individual riskychoice tendency for each pair of quota conditions. Although some pairs showed correlation (Fig. 3F, redder cells), a noteworthy question was whether the correlation was observed among the Non-/Easy-/ Imp-quota conditions, in which diverse choice patterns were observed. Remarkably, we observed signiﬁcant correlation between the Nonquota and Imp-quota conditions despite very distant conditions (n = 29, p = 0.0058, r = 0.50) (Fig. 3F, topmost-rightmost cell), suggesting that the risky-choice tendency in Non-/Imp-quota conditions reﬂected certain individual characteristics. To question whether this synchronized choice pattern in Non-/Imp-quota conditions reﬂected individual risk preference, we also tested the DOSPERT scale (Weber et al., 2002; Blais and Weber, 2006) as an index of trait risk attitude. When collapsing Non-/Imp-quota conditions, we found a positive correlation between DOSPERT score (ﬁnancial domain) and risky-choice probability in the Non-/Imp-quota conditions (n = 19, p = 0.031, r = 0.49), demonstrating that the diverse choice pattern appearing in the Non/Impquota conditions could reﬂect individual risk preference. Thus, choice  Fig. 3. Behavioral results. (A) Fraction of risky choice in the ﬁve quota conditions. Average data (thick lines, mean, and SD) were tested by one-way ANOVA.

Fujimoto, H. Takahashi / NeuroImage 139 (2016) 304–312  309  pattern analyses revealed that the participants employed a ‘strategy-optimization mode’ in the Low-/High-quota conditions and exerted ‘individual-preference mode’ in the Non-/Imp-quota conditions.  Correlation between dlPFC–dACC connectivity and the same behavioral indices was not observed. Altogether, fMRI analyses demonstrated a pivotal role of the prefrontal and salience-network areas for ﬂexible decision-making under quota.  Neural correlates tracking quota severity  In the behavioral analyses, we observed a linear relationship between quota severity and risky-choice tendency (Easy b Low b High b Imp) at the group level (Fig. 3A), and therefore, we expected to ﬁnd a similar pattern (‘quota severity’ contrast: Easy b Low b High b Imp) by fMRI analyses. Accordingly, we found signiﬁcant activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), the bilateral dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and the insular cortex including the right anterior insula (AI) (Fig. 4A–C), suggesting encoding of quota severity in these areas. Activations in other non-cognitive areas (primary motor cortex, cerebellum) were also observed.  Neural correlates of the utilization of strategy-optimization mode and individual-preference mode  We also expected to ﬁnd a corresponding pattern of the strategyoptimization mode (Low/High N Non/Imp) in the fMRI signal, but activation analysis did not reveal any signiﬁcant clusters. Then we investigated the functional-connectivity pattern by using the generalized form of the context-dependent psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) method (McLaren et al., 2012), which allowed us to implement ﬁve PPI regressors in a single GLM (see Materials and methods). When we set the left dlPFC as a seed, a signiﬁcant cluster was found in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) for the ‘strategy optimization’ contrast (Low/High N Non/Imp) (Fig. 5A). By the same left dlPFC seed setting, we found a signiﬁcant cluster in dACC for the ‘individual preference’ contrast (Non/Imp N Low/High) (Fig. 5B). The peak coordinates were located at [−14, 40, 34] for the dmPFC cluster and at [−6, 2, 40] for the dACC cluster. Analysis using right AI and dACC seeds yielded no signiﬁcant clusters. These results suggest that the up-regulation of dlPFC-dmPFC connectivity and the down-regulation of dlPFC-dACC connectivity contributed to the execution of the state-dependent optimal strategy.  To further elucidate the role of these functional-connectivity patterns, we looked for a correlation between the gPPI data and the behavioral data including the risky-choice probability (Fig. 3A) and the pretrial effect (Fig. 3E). The dlPFC–dmPFC connectivity in the strategyoptimization contrast (Low/High N Non/Imp) was positively correlated to the pre-trial effect in the Low-quota condition (n = 29, p = 0.026, r = 0.42) and negatively correlated to the risky-choice tendency in the Low-quota condition (n = 29, p = 0.043, r = −0.38). Because larger pre-trial effect and lower risky-choice probability in the Low-quota condition indicated deliberate execution of the optimal strategy, this correlation pattern suggested a positive relationship between the dlPFC–dmPFC functional connectivity and the behavioral adequateness.  Discussion  In the present study, we reported the inﬂuence of quota severity on risk attitude using a newly developed gambling task. Behavioral analysis revealed that the participants ﬂexibly utilized individual risk preference and state-dependent optimal strategy in a single session. The fMRI analysis showed neural correlates of quota severity in the activation patterns. Notably, functional-connectivity patterns exclusively reﬂected the process of optimal strategy execution, demonstrating neural substrates of ﬂexible utilization of distinct risk attitudes.  Most of the past models regarded agents as proﬁt maximizers. However, in real-life situations, we do not always aim to maximize proﬁt. Rather, humans and animals often aim to achieve a quota, like satisfying hunger or ﬁnishing a daily job (Summerﬁeld and Tsetsos, 2015). The concept of quota severity might integrate the prevailing views regarding risk attitude. The strategy-optimization mode, a choice strategy shifting in Low-/High-quota conditions, replicates the change of risk attitude according to the energetic state of animals (Caraco et al., 1980; Stephens and Krebs, 1986; St Onge and Floresco, 2009; Inagaki et al., 2014). On the other hand, the individual-preference mode, appearing in Non-/Imp-quota conditions, replicates many psychological studies that tested risk attitude without quota constraint (Huettel et al., 2006; Tobler et al., 2009; Symmonds et al., 2011; Takahashi, 2012). Hence, our results for the ﬁrst time observed two types of risk attitude that appeared, respectively, in a single session.  In the current paradigm, we used a hypothetical outcome (units) to change the state of the participants instead of manipulating the energetic state as the conventional way of ethological studies. This procedure allowed us to create extreme quota severity situations (i.e., Non-/Impquota conditions) in the task sequence, which was rarely tested in animal studies using food reward. Some recent studies also used a hypothetical outcome and examined the systematic change of risk attitude of human participants in a gambling task (Symmonds et al., 2010; Kolling et al., 2014), but they excluded the Non-/Imp-quota conditions from task settings and observed only strategy-optimization mode. The current task tested all the potential conﬁgurations of quota severity that an individual experiences in real-life situations, allowing us to examine ﬂexible switching of multiple risk attitudes in human participants.  One might suppose that subjective conﬁdence to clear a block quota could coincide with risk preference. However, the conﬁdence level did not have a systematic inﬂuence on risky choice. For instance, typical individuals who are less conﬁdent in a strict quota condition tend to take more risky options to clear the stage. However, individuals who are overconﬁdent also take more risky options (van Holst et al., 2014). Moreover, despite the completely different levels of conﬁdence in  Fig. 4.

Functional-connectivity analysis with gPPI method. (A) Group analysis tested ‘strategy optimization’ contrast (Low/High N Non/Imp) for the left dlPFC seed. Seed region (top) and coupling clusters (bottom) are displayed on 3-D brain map. The threshold was set at uncorrected p b 0.01. (B) Group analysis tested ‘individual preference’ contrast (Non/Imp N Low/High) for the left dlPFC seed. The threshold was set at uncorrected p b 0.01.  Non- and Imp-quota conditions, the pattern of risky choice in these two conditions was similar (Fig. 3A and F). Thus the effect of conﬁdence could be bi-directional on risky choice and not straightforward, at least in our task. The relationship between conﬁdence and behavior (risky choice), especially in extreme cases such as gambling disorder, is a topic that merits further studies.  The activation patterns in dACC and AI reﬂect the quota severity, suggesting involvement of the salience network (Craig, 2009; Singer et al., 2009). The salience network was referred to as the encoding of subjective perception, and particularly, the right AI response was implicated in reﬂecting negative arousal such as noxious shock stimuli that could threaten the homeostatic state (Brooks et al., 2002; Kong et al., 2006). In the current paradigm, quota severity was a crucial concern for task execution and potentially activated right AI as an aversive stimulus. Hence, our data imply that the salience network may contribute to the assessment of environmental strictness to prompt a quotadependent strategy shift. In addition to the salience-network activity, dlPFC also reﬂects the difference in quota conditions. dlPFC is known to play a crucial role in strategy switching by encoding decision variables including rules and task conditions (Wager et al., 2004; Rushworth et al., 2011; Stokes et al., 2013). In our task, utilizing EVbased and risky strategies was a central problem for the participants. Therefore, dlPFC may have played an important role in deciding choice strategy in the current trial.  Although we considered that the neuronal activity in the saliencenetwork areas and dlPFC encoded the quota severity, alternative interpretations might be possible. In particular, dACC has been heavily implicated in the monitoring of error or conﬂict (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004). Because risk-taking and ‘loss’ experience were more prevalent in higher quota trials, dACC activity could reﬂect loss feedback in the current task. Because the current paradigm did not dissociate these factors, the neural activities we observed in this study could reﬂect such components associated with quota severity.  The functional-connectivity pattern revealed by gPPI analysis was even more intriguing. First, dlPFC–dmPFC functional connectivity reﬂected the strategy-optimization mode rather than the quota severity itself. Correlation between this functional connectivity and the behavioral adequateness suggests contribution to the utilization of statedependent optimal strategy. In addition, this result implied that dmPFC had an important role in this state-dependent strategy optimization. In the current paradigm, prospective thinking was one of the crucial requirements for choosing an optimal option instead of just a favorable option. The function of prospective thinking or future planning has frequently been attributed to the posterior medial prefrontal cortices, including dmPFC (Schacter et al., 2007; Barbey et al., 2009). Past decision-making studies reported that dmPFC and adjacent dACC  were involved in representing the value of unchosen options that could regulate future actions (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Hayden et al., 2009; Boorman et al., 2011). Moreover, the cluster location reported by Kolling et al. (2014) (peak coordinates at [−2, 28, 36]), which encoded the severity of risk pressure, was at a similar position to that of the present dmPFC cluster (peak at [−14, 30, 40]), suggesting the importance of this region. Therefore, extensive communication between dmPFC and dlPFC might be needed to set a futuristic goal and utilize an optimal strategy.  We also found the ‘individual preference’ pattern in dlPFC–dACC functional connectivity, by applying an inverse contrast. Taking into account the fact that dACC is part of the salience network (Craig, 2009) and that dlPFC-dACC connectivity has been implicated in cognitive control (Shenhav et al., 2013), a decrease in dlPFC–dACC connectivity in Low-/High-quota conditions may facilitate attenuation of the affective signal from the salience network to dlPFC to diminish individualpreference-based risk-taking behaviors. Although the exact role of these areas and their functional couplings is still an open question, our results for the ﬁrst time reported the interplay of prefrontal and salience-network areas underlying the quota-dependent ﬂexible decision-making process.  It might be counter-intuitive that neither the vmPFC nor the striatum showed task-related signal in this study, despite their established role in value-based decision-making (O'Doherty, 2004; Rushworth et al., 2011). This was probably because our contrast settings focused on the differences among quota conditions rather than on the participants' choice decisions. The vmPFC and striatum could be more directly involved in the value comparison process, which was not directly investigated in the current study. Investigation of the interaction between quota-encoding areas and value-encoding areas during decisionmaking should be recommended in future studies.  As we mentioned earlier, two preceding studies had demonstrated the state-dependent ﬂexible risk attitude in human and recorded the neuronal activity by fMRI (Symmonds et al., 2010; Kolling et al., 2014). Both studies reported the dACC activation, suggesting the crucial role of dACC for state-dependent strategy optimization. However, neither study reported the involvement of dlPFC, despite its established role in ﬂexible decision-making (Buckley et al., 2009). Considering that our task tested broader quota conditions, demand for further ﬂexible utilization between individual-preference mode and strategyoptimization mode might evoke the dlPFC function and the dlPFCcentered functional connectivity.  Risk-sensitive decision-making is a crucial element in the ﬁelds of neuroscience, psychology, economics, ethology, and psychiatry (McNamara and Houston, 1992; Hayden and Platt, 2009). Our results may prompt a reconsideration of the phenomena in these research  A. Fujimoto, H. Takahashi / NeuroImage 139 (2016) 304–312  311  areas. For example, gambling disorder (GD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by excess risky gambling in spite of negative consequences (van Holst et al., 2010; Hodgins et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2013; Potenza, 2014). As past studies simply focused on the individual risk preferences of GD patients (i.e., excess risk-proneness), they may lack the ability of quota-dependent strategy optimization. In our concept of quota severity, higher goal-setting increases the perceived pressure of quota and in turn leads to more risky decision-making even if the objective circumstances are the same. Thus, our ﬁndings imply that unrealistic goal-setting regarding money might induce a negative spiral of monetary loss and gambling in GD patients. Testing of our GIG task on GD populations may uncover novel aspects of this psychiatric disorder. A limitation of the current study was that we identiﬁed gPPI clusters with only liberal thresholding (cluster-extent-based multiple comparison with cluster-deﬁning threshold p b 0.01), which could yield falsepositive clusters. Therefore, the results derived from the current functional-connectivity data should be treated in a cautious manner.  Conclusion  Our results illustrated the human ability to utilize different decisionmaking modes under quota, as well as their neural substrates. Quotadependent risk attitude potentially explains various phenomena concerning risk-sensitive decision-making in real-life situations. We are hopeful that our ﬁndings might contribute to a better understanding of psychiatric disorders or social conditions with altered risk-sensitive decision-making.

In a 3 Tesla MRI scanner 28 healthy participants were presented with four different instructions randomly combined with 32 false-belief cartoon stories of 3 subsequent pictures free of direct cues for affective states, like e.g. facial expressions. Participants were instructed to judge affective or visuospatial changes from their own (1st person perspective) or the protagonists' (3rd person perspective, 3rdpp) perspective. 3rdpp-judgements about affective states differed from visuospatial 3rdpp judgements by a signiﬁcantly higher activation of the anterior mentalizing network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, anterior superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles) and the limbic system (left amygdala and hippocampus). Analysis of main effects revealed that the anterior part of the mentalizing network was activated signiﬁcantly stronger by affective compared to visuospatial content. In contrast, the temporoparietal junction was rather activated by 3rdpp visuospatial judgements. After all, our results demonstrate a functional dissociation between cognitive empathy and cognitive visuospatial perspective taking. The simultaneous activation of the cortical mentalizing network and the amygdala indicates that cognitive empathy actually involves reference to own affective states in the observer. Notably, the cognitive reference to own affective states activated the mentalizing network as well. Moreover our results support pre-existing ideas about a functional anterior–posterior subdivision of the mentalizing network, depending on affective content and 3rd person perspective of cognition.  © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  In social and affective neuroscience the terms “mentalizing” and “empathy” represent two concepts of brain functions underpinning the human ability to assess mental representations as well as affective states of other individuals. The importance of this mental capabilities, which enable successful social interaction, is markedly illustrated by examples of their failure: Inference on the mental states of others has recently been recognized as an important factor in various psychic disorders like autism (Baron-Cohen, 2001), affective disorders (Inoue et al., 2006; Kerr et al., 2003) and schizophrenia (Brunet-Gouet and Decety, 2006; Walter et al., 2009) and was deﬁned as an explicit target for psychotherapy (Bateman and Fonagy, 2008). Thus mentalizing is a crucial object of basic cognitive and clinical neuroscience.  In general, inference on a 3rd person's mental state might emerge from two sources: It can either immediately arise from the perception  ⁎ Corresponding author.

As interventions in cognitive psychotherapy frequently modify the latter type of inference, we were especially interested to explore which functional elements are involved in the generation of primarily “cognitive” judgements about the affective state of another person.  Thus, we designed a mentalizing task where participants had to infer on another person's affective state without the guidance of any direct affective signals. We wanted to know if the already introduced term “cognitive empathy” (Preston and de Waal, 2002) represents a meaningful neurofunctional concept that can be linked to pre-existing knowledge about neural systems underlying mentalizing (Frith and Frith, 2006b) and empathy (Hein and Singer, 2008). This attempt is considerably complicated by the fact that both concepts comprise the process of recognizing other persons’ affective states but describe it with different terms:  Hein & Singer deﬁne empathy “as an affective state, caused by sharing of the emotions or sensory states of another person” (Hein and Singer, 2008). This concept of empathy is related to the activation of  1744  K. Schnell et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1743–1754  limbic regions, i.e. the ACC and insula in case of empathy for pain. In contrast to affective contagion, empathy is bound to the individual awareness that a speciﬁc emotion was primarily initiated in the other person (Hein and Singer, 2008). Hein & Singer distinguish empathy from “cognitive perspective taking as the ability to understand intentions, desires, beliefs of another person, resulting from (cognitively) reasoning about the other's state”. Notably they do not list emotions as a content of cognitive perspective taking. Hein & Singer's concept of empathy can be speciﬁcally termed as “affective empathy.” Affective empathy conveys isomorphic affective states–some concepts also include non-isomorphic reactions to the affective states of others (Dziobek et al., 2008)–by direct signalling and not by cognitive inference.  In contrast to the restrictive deﬁnition of empathy, mentalizing is deﬁned by Frith & Frith as “the process by which we make inferences about mental states” (Frith and Frith, 2006b) and does not only include the inference about another persons’ motivational states and beliefs but also the immediate recognition and the cognitive inference about other persons’ emotional states. In this article we will use the term “mentalizing” synonymously for the “Theory of Mind” concept (Premack and Woodruff, 1978) as suggested by Frith & Frith (Frith and Frith, 2003). The neural network recruited by mentalizing processes comprises dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), superior temporal sulcus (STS), the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the anterior temporal poles (TP) (Frith and Frith, 2006b).  However, a metaanalysis (Brunet-Gouet and Decety, 2006) revealed that most studies found partial activations of this network while some of these regions, especially the dmPFC, were also activated in perception of emotional facial expressions without actual demand of perspective change. Moreover, mentalizing is obviously more complex than cognitive perspective taking as the ontogenesis of this ability indicates both, implicit and explicit cognitive subfunctions (Frith and Frith, 2008; Wimmer and Perner, 1983).  After all, the knowledge about the affective states of others may rely on two sources, implicit “contagious” signals about others’ affective states as well as explicit cognitive inference utilizing semantic context information about the situation of another individual (Frith and Frith, 2008). These two processing streams in mentalizing could be addressed as bottom up (affective contagion) and top down (cognitive, deliberate mentalizing) systems.  In their recently published observations Shamay-Tsoory et al. provided further evidence that human empathy is indeed regulated by cognitive and affective components. In patients with lesions in ventromedial and ventrolateral PFC they could actually separate these components (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009). Preston and de Waal had already introduced the term “cognitive empathy” (Preston and de Waal, 2002) in 2002 but it remains unclear how this mechanism of affective states representation is actually linked to the deliberate (cognitive) domain of the mentalizing system (Saxe and Powell, 2006). A couple of related concepts have simultaneously explored the interlink between cognition and emotion processing using terms like affective mentalizing (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2007) or “cold” empathy (Davies and Stone, 2003; Davis and Kraus, 1991; McIllwain, 2003). To avoid arbitrary information we will use the term “cognitive empathy” synonymously for all these concepts.  In order to understand the particular nature of cognitive empathy, it is of great interest if the underpinning neurophysiological correlates really indicate that cognitive empathy is a pure “cognitive” or “cold” process in a strict sense. This would most likely be the case, if cognitive inference on the emotions of others would exclusively recruit the previously described cortical mentalizing network. In contrast simultaneous activation of the limbic system would rather indicate that cognitive empathy demands the arousal of an affective state in the observer.  To address this question we present this fMRI study which explores the neural foundations of cognitive empathy in contrast to  cognitive inference on non-affective, visuospatial representations of another person. To induce cognitive empathy in the absence of primary implicit affective processing we designed a set of false belief stories which were free of direct signs about the affective states of the actors—this was done by excluding expressive facial elements like mouth and eyebrows.  We planned to assess the underpinnings of cognitive empathy with a 2×2 design exploring the effects of perspective (3rd versus 1st person perspective) and affective content (affective versus visuospatial content). We hypothesized that judgements from the 3rd person perspective (pp) would activate the whole mentalizing network signiﬁcantly higher than judgements from the 1st pp. Simultaneously we expected affective judgements to engage anterior parts of the mentalizing network and limbic areas signiﬁcantly stronger than visuospatial judgements. After all we expected “cognitive empathy” to engage neocortical and limbic brain regions simultaneously. In detail, we hypothesized a parallel activation of the previously described mentalizing network comprising dmPFC, STS, TPJ and TP and limbic regions like anterior insula, ACC, amygdala and hippocampus as a differential effect of cognitive empathy compared to cognition about visuospatial content from 3rd person perspective and especially compared to visuospatial judgements from the 1st person perspective. Due to the unclarity about the speciﬁc function of dmPFC in mentalizing, it was of special interest which factor–perspective or content–would predominantly impact on dmPFC activation.  Materials and methods  Subjects  28 healthy volunteers were recruited via local newspaper and campus advertisements. Five participants had to be excluded from further analysis after scanning due to head movements exceeding one voxel (N3 mm) between two subsequent volumes. Three participants were excluded due to a low number of correct answers (b60%) for visuospatial judgements from the 3rd person perspective (exclusion criteria were overlapping in one subject). The probability of a correct answer by chance was 33% (3 possible responses). The high threshold for inclusion due to accuracy in the visuospatial 3rd person perspective condition was chosen to assure that participants would be able to solve the other tasks, as successful visuospatial perspective taking seems to be a prerequisite to comprehend the false belief tasks and the affective states elucidated by the false beliefs of the protagonist (Table S2, supplementary material).  After all the data of 21 subjects (9 female, mean age 25.49, SD 5.01) were included for statistical analysis. All subjects were right-handed (Edinburgh handedness inventory score N0.8 (Oldﬁeld, 1971)). All participants gave their written consent. The study was conducted in accordance to the regulations of the local Ethics Committee and the declaration of Helsinki (WorldMedicalAssociation, 2004) and was approved by the local institutional review board.  Experimental procedure  The experimental task (480 s) consisted of 32 false belief cartoon stories which were randomly assigned to four different experimental instructions for each individual participant (Fig. 1). Participants were instructed to judge picture to picture changes in visuospatial representations or affective states either from the ﬁrst or from the third person perspective. They did so by pressing a button with the thumb, index or middle ﬁnger of their right hand (left=less/worse, mid=equal, right=more/better). The 8 trials of each condition consisted of a text instruction (6.53 s) and a cartoon story (22.58 s). Each story was composed of 3 consecutive pictures (7.53 s/picture) developing a story around a protagonist which was distinguished from other ﬁgures in the story by a bold outline.  K. Schnell et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1743–1754  1745  Fig. 1. Left: Experimental design 32 false belief cartoon stories consisting of 3 subsequent pictures were randomly assigned to four different experimental instructions. Participants were instructed to judge picture to picture changes in visuospatial representations (less/equally many/more living beings recognizable)/affective states (worse/equal/better) either from the 1st or 3rd person perspective. Each trial consisted of a text instruction (6.53 s) and a cartoon story (22.58 s). Each trial was developing a story around a protagonist which was distinguished from other ﬁgures by a bold outline. Right: Analysis of reaction time indicated that visuospatial judgements from the 1st person perspective were signiﬁcantly faster than all other judgments.  For the 1st pp, the participants were trained to make judgements from their own perspective, i.e. to see the situation through their own eyes. For the affective 1st pp participants were instructed to judge changes in their own affective states when attending to the course of the stories. For example, someone could feel pity when recognizing that the protagonist is obviously making a mistake (1st pp) while the protagonist would still feel ﬁne or even better in the false belief of approaching a goal (3rd pp) because he has not recognized the cognitive error implied in his perspective yet.  During the training phase the comprehension of these instructions and the ability to comply with them was assured by letting the participants explain the cognitive operations underlying their judgements to the experimenter in all four conditions. The comprehension of the task and the individual capacity to infer on visuospatial representations and affective states of the stories' protagonist was assured by explicit verbal instruction by the experimenter and a 10min training with a notebook where participants explained the cognitions underlying their judgements to the experimenter. The criterion for the start of the fMRI session was–based on the reported  cognitive operations and judgements–that the participant was actually able to put him/herself in the shoes of the protagonist of the story.  The different instructions indicating the four conditions were  presented in German language with the following content:  Judge affective changes from ﬁrst person perspective (1stppA): "Do you feel worse-equal-better compared to the previous picture?” Judge affective changes from third person perspective (3rdppA): "Does the protagonist feel worse-equal-better compared to the previous picture?”  Judge visuospatial changes from ﬁrst person perspective (1stppV): “Is the number of living beings smaller–equal–greater compared to the previous picture?”  Judge visuospatial changes from third person perspective (3rdppV): ”Is the number of living beings perceived by the protagonist smaller–equal–greater compared to the previous picture?”  To rule out confounds of content we randomized the cartoon stories over conditions and subjects. The content of all stories was  1746  K. Schnell et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1743–1754  designed to make sense with each of the four questions. Notably pictures were free of direct / contagious signs of the characters’ emotions like e.g. facial expressions. In addition, the occurrence of a false belief in the protagonist was generally related to both, his/her affective state and his/her belief about the number of living beings present in the situation: For example (Fig. 1), the protagonist misattributes the behaviour of another person who is holding a baseball batter as an attack and not as part of a game, because he does not perceive the second player behind the corner, who is going to throw the ball. His mood will certainly improve as soon as he infers the presence of a second human being in the context of a game by recognizing the ball thrown around the corner. Thereby we assured that both visuospatial and affective content of judgements actually comprised theory of mind generation or mentalizing and not just visuospatial processing.  In the design of the task we assured that the task would induce affective mentalizing by constructing scenes with immediate affective relevance of the depicted events. We controlled the capability of the resulting stimuli to measure affective mentalizing with the following methods. All stories had been rated by 44 students (23 f; 21 m, Mean 23.23 years SD 2.65 years) attending a course in medical psychology at the faculty of medicine of the university of Bonn. This was done to assure an overall homogeneity of answers in the affective 3rd pp judgements, i.e. that the majority of students would infer the same change in affective state in the 3rd pp judgements (3 choices /chance level of 33%). These ratings basically enabled us to check the answers of the participants in the fMRI experiment, even though, as mentioned in the limitations, affective 3rd pp judgements are generally more ambiguous than judgements based on visuospatial transformations. However, since visuospatial transformations are a prerequisite to succeed in the task, we applied a rigid criterion for the ﬁnal analysis by excluding all subjects using a stringent level of less than 60% of correct answers (below 10 of 16) in the 3rd pp visuospatial judgements. This was done to enhance the speciﬁcity of the experiment, by assuring that all subjects actually followed the instructions, to take over the protagonist's perspective. Finally, we did control for condition related differences in difﬁculty, possibly related to other domains of brain function like e.g. attention, by modelling reaction time (RT)differences in the second level analysis as a regressor of no interest. The experiment was presented with the Presentation software package (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, California) using binocular LCD-Goggles (Nordic Neurolab, Bergen, Norway) connected to the headcoil. The responses were recorded with ﬁberoptic response devices (Nordic Neurolab, Bergen, Norway).  Data acquisition  Functional data were acquired on a SIEMENS Trio MR-scanner at 3 T ﬁeld strength with a echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence (461 whole brain scans, TR 2,06 s, TE 30 ms, 80 degrees ﬂip angle, slices of 4 mm thickness including 20% gap, 3×3 mm in plane resolution of 64× 64 voxels, ascending slice order). Individual anatomical data were acquired with a T1-FFE sequence (TR 30 ms, TE 4.5 ms, ﬂip angle 30º, 70 slices, 256×256 matrix, ﬁeld of view 256×256 mm, slice spacing 1 mm).  Behavioral data analysis  Behavioral performance was analyzed with SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) by means of ANOVA analysis and paired t-tests of intraindividual mean values of reaction times (RT) for each condition.  fMRI data analysis  The ﬁrst four volumes were discarded to allow T1 equilibration. Data analysis was carried out using Statistical Parametric Mapping  with SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK; www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk) implemented in Matlab 7.1 (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) for whole brain data analysis. Preprocessing of individual data started with a 4th degree B-spline realignment. For normalization a transformation matrix between the mean image of realigned volumes and the SPM5-EPI (MNI) template was generated with a trilinear algorithm and applied to reslice volumes with a voxel size of 3×3×3 mm. For spatial smoothing a Gaussian Kernel of 9 mm full width at half maximum was chosen to increase sensitivity for cortical activations in group inference. The standard hemodynamic response function (HRF) was used for convolution with the covariates of the experimental design.  First level analysis of fMRI data was performed according to the general linear model. The epoch model was generated with four blocked predictive regressors for the processing of stories under 4 experimental conditions (1stppV, 1stppA, 3rdppV, 3rdppA), four blocked regressors for the respective instructional texts and one regressor for button presses. To control for the inﬂuence of head movements, translation and rotation parameters estimated by the realignment algorithm were included as covariates of no interest.  The second level model utilized the individual contrast images for simple effects (1stppV, 1stppA, 3rdppV, 3rdppA) from the ﬁrst-level analysis. The differential effects of the experimental tasks were assessed with a repeated measures ANOVA (i.e. SPM5 “ﬂexible factorial”) model. To control for the expected differences in the attentional demands of the different conditions, i.e. to disentangle the functional domains of attention and picture to picture working memory involvement from social cognitive processes, the difference between the RT for each condition and the mean RT of the four conditions in each participant was modelled as a covariate of no interest in the group analysis.  The second level analysis comprised statistical testing of main effects of affective content and 3rd vs. 1st person perspective of judgments. In order to understand the emergence of main effects in detail, we tested for single differential effects between the cells of the design. To explore the commonalities in differential neural activation we added conjunction analyses for both factors. All reported results of statistical comparisons were thresholded for a voxel-level of p b0.05 which was corrected for multiple testing across the whole brain with the false discovery rate (FDR) method.  Finally we explored possible interactions between content and perspective. Only this explorative analysis of interaction effects was performed without correction for multiple comparisons (p b0.001, uncorrected), as we expected the interaction effects to be notably smaller, while however of great interest in order to understand the interplay of mentalizing and content on brain function.  Results  Analysis of behavioral data  Data analysis revealed that the reaction time (RT) for visuospatial judgements from the self perspective (RT 2617 ms, SD 544) was signiﬁcantly lower (p b0.01, two tailed paired t-tests ) than the RTs of all other conditions, i.e. 1stppA (RT 3199 ms, SD 792), 3rdppV (RT 3093 ms, SD 691) and 3rdppA (RT 3072 ms, SD 703). There were no signiﬁcant differences between the three latter conditions (Fig. 1). After all, reaction times indicated, that conditions comprising either affective content or 3rd person perspective demanded more complex cognitive processing than self-referential judgements with visuospatial content. We assumed that these RT differences reﬂected the difﬁculty and attentional complexity of tasks rather than effects of perspective or content per se. Thus we controlled for these differences by including them as a covariate in the functional analysis. The RT differences were actually correlated with the activation of a cortical  K. Schnell et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1743–1754  1747  network previously associated with executive control functions (see Table S1, Fig. S1 Supplementary materials).  Analysis of functional imaging data  Main effects  Analysis of main effects generally revealed a difference in the activation of anterior and posterior parts of the mentalizing network determined by affective content and 3rd person perspective.  We found a signiﬁcant main effect of affective content (affective Nvisuospatial: 3rd ppA, 1st ppAN3rd ppV, 1st ppV) in posterior as well as in anterior parts of the previously described mentalizing network namely in bilateral TPJ, posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior parts of the mentalizing network, namely bilateral dmPFC, anterior STS, TP (p b0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR). Simultaneously a main effect of affective content was found in left hemispheric limbic areas i.e. in the left amygdala and hippocampus (Fig. 2, Table 1). In contrast, main effects of 3rd person perspective (3rd ppA, 3rd ppVN1st ppA, 1st ppV) on the BOLD response were only found in more posterior cortices, namely in the TPJ, in the precuneus extending into the posterior cingulate gyrus and in bilateral middle frontal gyri at the location of the frontal eyeﬁelds (Blanke et al., 2000) (p b0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR).  With respect to the main effects of both factors in bilateral TPJ, it is notable that analysis of interaction between content and perspective with a more liberal statistical threshold (p b0.001, uncorr., cluster size k=10 voxels) revealed a greater differential activation of the right TPJ by 3rd PP in the visuospatial condition (3rdppV–1stppV)–(3rdppA– 1stppA) (Fig. 3, Table 2).  Simple effects  To understand the speciﬁc contributions of both factors to the main effects and the speciﬁc differences between cognitive empathy i.e. 3rd PP affective judgements and the three other conditions, we analyzed the simple differential effects of affective content and 3rd person perspective.  Effect of affective content in 3rd pp judgements (3rd ppA N3rd ppV)  Cognition about the affective state of a 3rd person (cognitive empathy) determined a signiﬁcantly higher BOLD-signal in the anterior parts of the mentalizing network and left hemispheric limbic regions than cognition about visuospatial content (Fig.3, Table 3, (p b0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR). In detail the differential effect was observed in dmPFC, bilateral posterior STS, bilateral temporal poles, in the left amygdala and hippocampus and the left posterior cingulate gyrus. In posterior regions of the mentalizing network only one small cluster in left TPJ showed higher activation for  Fig. 2.

Higher activation was also observed in bilateral inferior frontal gyri and left vmPFC, previously characterized as parts of the mirror neuron system (Gazzola et al., 2006) and somatic marker system (Bechara et al., 2000).  Effect of 3rd pp in affective judgements (3rd ppA N 1st ppA)  Although we had expected a signiﬁcantly higher activation of the whole mentalizing network in 3pp affective judgements than in 1st pp affective judgements, no signiﬁcant differences were found (p b0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR). The pattern of functional differences we had expected in the latter contrast, i.e. higher activation of the TPJ, dmPFC and STS in 3rd pp, was actually found as an effect of affective judgement within the 1st PP i.e. in the contrast between 1st pp affective versus 1st pp visuospatial judgements as described below. Notably, an analogous effect of affective content and perspective was found in reaction times.  Effect of affective content in 1st pp judgements (1st ppA N1st ppV)  Comparison of affective and visuospatial content in 1st pp judgements revealed that cognition about own affective reactions to the story content resulted in a higher activation the entire mentalizing network, although participants had not been instructed to infer on the feelings of others (p b0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR). Affective judgements induced greater BOLD-responses in bilateral dmPFC, TPJ and posterior STS extending into the temporal poles. Additionally, we observed higher activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus as well as left vmPFC. Remarkably, no effects in limbic regions were found. Most remarkably the same pattern of functional  differences was found in the comparison of 3rd pp affective and 1st pp visuospatial judgements (Fig. 3, Table 4).  Effect of 3rd pp in visuospatial judgements (3rd ppV N 1st ppV)  Compared to visuospatial judgements from the 1st pp, 3rd pp judgements about visuospatial representations resulted in higher bilateral BOLD-signals in the TPJ and precuneus (Fig. 3, Table 5, p b0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR).  Conjunction analysis  Finally, to assess the common effects of affective content we applied a conjunction of all four possible contrasts between judgements with affective compared to visuospatial content (i.e. 1stppA N1stppV,1stppA N3rdppV,3rdppA N3rdppV,3rdppA N1stppV) (Table 6). Conjunction analysis actually revealed that all affective judgements resulted in increased activation of bilateral dmPFC, bil. posterior STS extending into the temporal poles (Table 6, p b0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR). Additional increase was observed in bilateral inferior frontal gyri and left vmPFC. Notably affective content of judgments generally activated both cerebellar hemispheres signiﬁcantly stronger than judgements about visuospatial content.  On the contrary the conjunction of contrasts between 3rd and 1st person perspective judgements did not reveal any common effects of 3rd person perspective (i.e. 3rdA N1stA, 3rdA N1stV, 3rdV N1stV, 3rdV N1stA). This result was obviously based on the absence of differences between 3rd and 1st pp when affective judgements were made.  K. Schnell et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1743–1754  1749  Fig. 3. Left: Results of tests for functional differences between single conditions. Simple effects of affective content (a) and perspective (b) were basically found in different parts of the network. Affective content of judgements activated the anterior areas (dmPFC, vmPFC, ant. STS, TP) while visuospatial perspective taking recruited posterior parts (TPJ) differentially. The simultaneous activation of anterior and posterior parts of the network in affective compared to visuospatial judgements from the 1st pp (c) suggested that affective comprehension of the stories actually demanded implicit perspective taking, although participants were told to stick to judge their own affective states (all tests for simple effects on voxel-level p b0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR, k=20 voxels). Right: (e) Effects of interaction between 3rdpp and visuospatial content were found in the right IPL, while the inversely directed interaction (f) effect occurred mainly in right precentral and mid cingulate gyrus (blue 1stpp V, dark blue 3rdppV, orange 1stppA,red 3rdppA; both interactions p b0.001 uncorr).  Discussion  This study was set up to explore the hypotheses, that cognitive empathy can be characterized as a brain function relating to preexisting neurofunctional concepts about mentalizing and empathy. We expected the regions of the previously described mentalizing network and the limbic system to be activated during cognitions about the affective states of others. To explore cognitive inference  speciﬁcally, we designed false belief stories, which were free of affective cues.

In detail, we expected this parallel activation as a differential effect of cognitive empathy compared to 3rd pp and 1st pp visuospatial judgements.  Our observations basically veriﬁed this hypothesis. The main effect of affective content and the single differential effect between 3rd pp affective and 3rd pp visuospatial judgements in dmPFC, STS, TP and in the amygdala indicated that cognitive inference on the affective state of others can actually be dissociated from mentalizing their visuospatial experiences.  Dissociable effects of cognitive empathy and mentalizing of visuospatial content  In general the results of our experiment replicate previous observations about the anatomical formation of the mentalizing or ToM network which frequently list dmPFC, STS, TPJ, TP as functional elements (Brune and Brune-Cohrs, 2006; Brunet-Gouet and Decety,  2006; Frith and Frith, 2006b, 2008; Saxe and Baron-Cohen, 2006). Activation of these regions was found as a differential effect of 3rd pp affective versus 1st pp visuospatial judgements and (Table 1) as a main effect of affective versus visuospatial content.  Most notably the speciﬁc differential effect of affective compared to visuospatial judgements within the 3rd person perspective supports the existence of a functional mode that can be addressed as “cognitive empathy”. The difference conﬁrms the assumption of Shamay-Tsoory (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009) and Preston (Preston and de Waal, 2002) that the term cognitive empathy can actually be attributed to a particular functional mode of social cognition, especially in the PFC. In contrast to visuospatial perspective taking, cognitive empathy is functionally characterized by a simultaneous recruitment of the anterior parts of the previously characterized mentalizing network (Brunet-Gouet and Decety, 2006; Frith and Frith, 2006b), namely anterior STS, TP and vmPFC in combination with limbic regions already found to be involved in affective processing and  Table 4 3rd person visuospatial N 1st person visuospatial judgements (threshold on voxel level p b 0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR, k = 20 voxels).

The activation of amygdala and hippocampus in the cognitive empathy condition is in line with Tanja Singer's suggestion “that sharing the emotions of others is associated with activation in neural structures that are also active during the ﬁrst-hand experience of that emotion”.  Accordingly, our ﬁndings imply that cognitive empathy does actually involve a “simulated” generation of affective states by means of limbic system activation in the absence of external affective signals, which has been reported previously by Ruby & Decety (Ruby and Decety, 2004). They observed amygdala activation when subjects were processing social emotions, related either to themselves or to another person. The simulation-theory of cognitive empathy is further supported by the lack of functional differences between 1st and 3rd pp in affective conditions in our study. This ﬁnding suggests that participants exploited information from own affective states in order to understand the affective state of another person. The general involvement of simulation in mentalizing is also supported by observations of Lombardo et al. (Lombardo et al., 2009) who reported the integration of both high and low level neural systems during mentalizing of bodily as well as mental states. Following this line of evidence our observations do not support the existence of a previously suggested distinct cortical network for a “cold” type of empathy (McIllwain, 2003; Paal and Bereczkei, 2007). Cognitive  empathy rather recruits both top down neocortical and bottom up limbic components simultaneously. Thus, our results suggest that the emergence of affective states in the observer is implied in cognitive empathy as well as in affective empathy (i.e. empathy as deﬁned by Singer et al.). The differential activation of amygdala and hippocampus in the generation of cognitive empathy compared to visuospatial judgements is even more notable as our task bypassed the implicit–or “low road” (Doron and Ledoux, 2000; Romanski and LeDoux, 1992)– subcortical pathway of immediate emotion perception by excluding contagious affective cues from the stimulus material. Accordingly the contextual information had to be processed through the cortical “high road” processing stream ﬁrst. It is important to mention, that a considerable part of the differential effect between affective and visuospatial 3rd pp judgements is generated by a decrease of amygdala activation in 3rd pp visuospatial judgements (see effects plot in Fig. 2). In contrast dmPFC activation seems to be inﬂuenced by equal contributions of activation in affective and reduced activation in visuospatial judgements. Note that we randomized the stimulus material over conditions across all participants of the experiment and thus eliminated by design potential implicit inﬂuences of stimulus features and scenic complexity on the comparisons of cognitive conditions.  In general the analyses of main and especially single effects provide evidence that the term cognitive empathy indeed provides a  Table 6 Conjunction Affective judgements N Visuospatial Judgements (threshold on voxel-level p b 0.05, whole brain corrected for multiple testing using FDR, k = 20 voxels).

Schnell et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1743–1754  meaningful neurofunctional concept as it can be deﬁned by means of local differences between functional states within the mentalizing network and limbic system.  Functional subdivision of the mentalizing network  In addition to the functional dissociation of cognitive empathy from mentalizing of other content we found additional new evidence for the frequently discussed basic anatomical subdivision of the mentalizing network. The fact that the main effect of taking the 3rd pp was only found in posterior parts of the network including TPJ, precuneus and frontal eyeﬁelds supports the idea that functions for affective processing and perspective taking are organized along the anterior–posterior axis of the brain (Decety and Lamm, 2007; Frith and Frith, 2006b; Olsson and Ochsner, 2008; Saxe et al., 2006; Saxe and Powell, 2006).  In contrast, the main effect of affective content of cognition was found in the bilateral TPJ as well as in the anterior part of the network, comprising dmPFC, vmPFC, TP ant STS. The conjunction analysis indicated that only the anterior regions of the mentalizing network were recruited to process affective content in all conditions irrespective of the cognitive perspective. Not only cognitive empathy but also judgements about one's own affective states activated dmPFC, anterior STS, and temporal poles signiﬁcantly stronger than cognitions with a visuospatial content.  Previous reports already suggested such a specialization of the anterior mPFC for affective and motivational state recognition (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Olsson and Ochsner, 2008) and recognition of others’ intentions (Abraham et al., 2008; Ciaramidaro et al., 2007; Walter et al., 2004).  Notably, we also found signiﬁcant activation of the left and right inferior PFC as a main effect of affective content. This region has been implicated as being part of the human analogue to the mirror neuron system (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004). Therefore, it might be speculated that the mirror neuron system is also involved in affective mentalizing. However, it has to be noted, that our peak activation is located 1–2 cm more anterior to the regions that have been described in a recent neuroimaging study, which provided evidence for the existence of mirror neurons in the human inferior frontal cortex (Kilner et al., 2009).  Function of mPFC in cognitive empathy  In accordance with our ﬁndings, previous studies found no differential dmPFC activation for solitary mental perspective changes (Aichhorn et al., 2006; Vogeley et al., 2004). Ochsner et al. (Ochsner et al., 2004) already found areas of the anterior mPFC to be recruited by both, judgements about affective states of oneself and others, while some anterior mPFC areas were exclusively recruited by selfreferential affective judgements. They suggested that in reﬂecting upon feelings, the mPFC might contribute to elaboration of internally as opposed to externally generated information. The consistent activation of mPFC by affective content in both 1st and 3rd person perspective, found in the main effect and conjunction analyses, provides additional support for this assumption because in our study subjects had to refer to internally generated information: In contrast to the direct affective signals contained in the IAPS pictures, the stimulus material in our study clearly demanded reference to internal representations of affective states. In further accordance with our observations, Saxe et al. also found the mPFC to be activated irrespective of perspective (Saxe et al., 2006). The fact that we found a differential effect of affective compared to visuospatial content not only in dorsal mPFC but also ventral mPFC is consistent with Rebecca Saxe's functional concept of these regions. She suggests that dmFPC is implicated in triadic relations while vmPFC is recruited in generating emotional empathy (Saxe, 2006). Thereby activation of  the vmPFC is identiﬁed as a central element of cognitive empathy with respect to the deﬁnition of empathy as a shared functional mechanism for experiencing others' and own affective states. Activation of the vmPFC during mentalization of affective states has previously been observed when a rater recognizes similarities between himself and another person (Mitchell et al., 2005). The vmPFC apparently holds a central function in the prospective judgement of own likes and dislikes in a variety of prospective contexts (Ames et al., 2008; Jenkins et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2006), which are supposedly used to infer on other persons’ affective states in a similar context.  A lesion study and functional data reported by Shamay-Tsoory et al. indicates that the involvement of vmPFC is indeed essential for the cognitive generation of empathy (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2006). According to the design of our experiment, this essential function might be the association between internal affective states and semantic cognitions about social contexts: This suggestion reﬂects the concept of the vmPFC function in social cognition by Bechara and Damasio (Bechara et al., 2003). They assume that the ventromedial cortex is critically involved in the triggering of somatic states from secondary inducers in contrast to primary inducers which are primarily processed by the amygdala. Secondary inducers are supposed to be generated by recalling a personal or hypothetical emotional event that generates “thoughts” and “memories” about the inducer, which elicit a somatic state when they are brought to memory. Episodic memories, like for example the memory of having been threatened by a gesture of another person at some point in life that can be triggered by the false believe story in Fig. 1, bring to memory “thoughts” pertaining to an emotional event. Another aspect of our results suggests that the recall of previously experienced affective states by contextual semantic cues is obviously independent from the fact if the triggered affective state is ﬁnally attributed to the 3rd and 1st person perspective.  TPJ function and the absence of functional perspective effects in affective judgements  Other than expected we found no signiﬁcant activation differences in the mentalizing network between 3rd and 1st person perspective on affective content. This single differential effect was most notably absent in the TPJ although a main effect of 3rd pp had been observed here. In contrary to our expectations, we found a signiﬁcant differential activation of the mentalizing network within the 1st person perspective instead which was accompanied by a signiﬁcant reaction time difference as an effect of affective content, i.e. between affective and visuospatial cognition in the 1st pp. This observation did not comply with our primary expectations about the effect of the explicit instructions to make self-referential affective judgements. We suggest that this observation indicates that assessment of own affective states in perception of a social context engages functional mentalizing resources in an automatic or implicit way as previously suggested by Frith and Frith (Frith and Frith, 2006b, 2008).  After all, comprehension of affective content in the story recruited the neural correlates of the mentalizing system (dmPFC, STS, TPJ, TP and vmPFC) in a similar way during explicit judgements about affective states of others (“How does he feel when this happens to him?”) and implicitly in the report of own affective states when facing a social context (“How do I feel when I see what happens to him in this story?”). As both questions obviously recruit identical neural structures which are involved in mentalizing, it can be assumed that both types of assessments include a processing step of inference on the thoughts of the other person. This mechanism is possibly reﬂected in the interaction of affective content and perspective in the right TPJ (Fig. 3). However, the involved TPJ function is obviously more than just providing visuospatial calculations like a kind of “camera perspective”, since David et al. reported, that the posterior temporal cortex is involved in mentalizing but not in simple perspective taking  K. Schnell et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1743–1754  1753  (David et al., 2008; Vogeley et al., 2004). Thus TPJ is supposedly only involved when inference on another person's mental content and visuospatial perspective is actually combined. In our experiment visuospatial perspective taking was actually combined with the inference on a mental object categorization process of another person. This was done by including the categorical decision how many of the objects were categorized by the main character under the category “living”, which would involve the TPJ like in other 3rd person conceptual tasks (Ruby and Decety, 2003). The fact that this instruction induced a bilateral TPJ activation combined with activation of the precuneus actually supports the idea of Saxe et al. who suggested that these posterior regions are involved in inferring on a protagonist's thoughts, but not on others’ internal states or other socially relevant information (Saxe and Powell, 2006). This concept was most markedly reﬂected in the actual interaction of 3rd person perspective and content of judgement that we found in the right TPJ. The selective involvement of the right TPJ in visuospatial components of mentalizing processes is supposedly linked to the adjacent locations of attentional functions within this area (Scholz et al., 2009) or a general function in relational context representation (Abraham et al., 2008) which is in turn reﬂected by activation due to 3rd person perspective of action perception and during action execution in interpersonal contexts (David et al., 2006). Taking all this together it can be assumed that the visuospatial context representation function of TPJ and precuneus is supposedly a basic prerequisite for mentalizing processes which can be ﬁnally directed to various types of mental content representations (Aichhorn et al., 2006; Aichhorn et al., 2009; Dosch et al., 2010; Lombardo et al., 2009; Ruby and Decety, 2001, 2003).  As TPJ activation did also differ between self-referential conditions in our study, one could assume, that it can be explained by another more basic function of TPJ: The activation differences could simply reﬂect the cognitive complexity of conditions, reﬂected in different reaction times. Decety & Lamm have already noted that “activation in the TPJ during social cognition may therefore rely on a lower-level computational mechanism involved in generating, testing, and correcting internal predictions about external sensory events” (Decety and Lamm, 2007). The idea of implicit or automated TPJ functions underpinning social cognition (Frith and Frith, 2006b, 2008) is supported by the neurodevelopmental course of cortical activation changes in mentalizing tasks. During brain maturation the ability to reason about another person's mind is underpinned by a shift in activity from PFC to TPJ brain regions (Dosch et al., 2010).  Correspondingly, we addressed the issue of interference between mentalizing and other cognitive domains, like e.g. error detection, by controlling for reaction time differences between conditions and subjects in the analysis of functional data. We found that reaction times were actually correlated with the activation of another functional network frequently associated with attention and error detection (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004) comprising activation of mPFC posterior to the activation associated with mentalizing conditions, dorsolateral PFC and inferior parietal lobes bilaterally. As these functional effects had been identiﬁed and covaried out, we assume that the remaining conditional differences of TPJ activations are not determined by the attentional functions but reﬂect a categorical effect of cognitive perspective taking. This conclusion is in line with the concept of Saxe et al., who consider the TPJ activation as a component of mentalizing which develops late in ontogenesis and not just as an effect of increased cognitive demand. TPJ activation is linked to perspective change (Saxe et al., 2006) and responds selectively when subjects read about a protagonist's thoughts (Saxe and Powell, 2006). This function is supposedly mirrored in the interaction effect found in the right TPJ (Fig. 3). Eventually mentalizing and low-level computations might be adjoining TPJ-functions as a recent study actually found ToM and attentional load of a task to recruit different regions of the TPJ (Scholz et al., 2009).  Limitations  A limitation of our study is owed to the fact that, in contrast to our prior expectations, our results delineated a greater interaction of affective content and 3rd person perspective. The experimental design is not suitable to explore the sequential steps involved in the assessment of the stories. Accordingly, we can just speculate how mentalizing is involved in 1st person perspective affective judgements.  We would have liked to investigate on the accuracy of affective mentalizing, but another limitation of the design is that the assessment of affective states is by nature more ambiguous than the assessment of quantities like the number of living beings in the pictures. For that reason we did not include scores of right answers in the statistical analysis. Of course there was always an obviously wrong answer beneath the three possibilities and the number of wrong answers was a good indicator to control for attention to the task during the experiment. However, future experiments could investigate on the accuracy of affective mentalizing by constructing stories with unique answers. In contrast we used the correct answers in visuospatial conditions, which were uniquely deﬁned, to control for the correct execution of the task.  Summary  We presented evidence for the existence of a neurophysiological correlate of “cognitive empathy” representing a meaningful neurofunctional mode. It can be dissociated from other mentalizing functions, especially from the mentalizing of visuospatial content by higher simultaneous activation of the anterior mentalizing network (dmPFC, anterior STS, TP, vmPFC) and limbic regions (HC, Amygdala) in the absence of immediately contagious affective signals. Notable similarities of the observed activations of the limbic system and the PFC with those previously reported for states of affective empathy suggest that cognitive empathy also involves emergence of and reference to internal affective states.  The observations about effects of 3rd person perspective and affective content on BOLD-signals in the dmPFC and TPJ indicated a functional subdivision of the mentalizing network along an anterior– posterior axis. Finally, the higher activation of the mentalizing network in 1st person judgements about affective compared to visuospatial content indicates that the perception of a social context activates the mentalizing system automatically even without deliberate adoption of the 3rd person perspective.

SUMMARY  Human subjects are proﬁcient at tracking the mean and variance of rewards and updating these via prediction errors. Here, we addressed whether humans can also learn about higher-order relationships between distinct environmental outcomes, a deﬁning ecological feature of contexts where multiple sources of rewards are available. By manipulating the degree to which distinct outcomes are correlated, we show that subjects implemented an explicit model-based strategy to learn the associated outcome correlations and were adept in using that information to dynamically adjust their choices in a task that required a minimization of outcome variance. Importantly, the experimentally generated outcome correlations were explicitly represented neuronally in right midinsula with a learning prediction error signal expressed in rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Thus, our data show that the human brain represents higher-order correlation structures between rewards, a core adaptive ability whose immediate beneﬁt is optimized sampling.  INTRODUCTION  Risk is ubiquitous in nature with predation, starvation, adverse environmental change, or lack of reproductive opportunity acting as constant background variables that shape an animal’s behavior. Animals evolved a variety of strategies to minimize risk such as diversifying mating behavior (Fox, 2003) or ‘‘bet-hedging.’’ For example, desert bees mitigate against large temporal variability in rainfall by stabilizing their birth rate (Danforth, 1999; Hopper, 1999). These risk-spreading strategies act to minimize between-year variance in reproductive success in a similar way to cost averaging, where ﬁnancial investors periodically purchase risky assets to reduce the overall risk of an investment portfolio (Dodson, 1989). Our concern here is with risk as deﬁned by outcome variability, measured from the variance of an outcome distribution. This is a ﬁrst-order approximation of risk commonly used as a critical decision variable in ecological (Stephens, 1981) and ﬁnancial (Markowitz, 1952) decision analysis.  Although the aforementioned strategies are naive with respect to higher-order structure in the environment, organisms can reduce risk even more effectively if they deploy knowledge of how different environmental states occur in relation to each other by representing correlations (Yoshimura and Clark, 1991). Thus, a lion learning that buffalo congregate at water holes on hotter days can reduce the chance of starvation by allocating more predation time to this food source by simply registering that the weather on a particular day is hot. In effect, knowledge of a covariance structure between discrete events allows inferences as to the presence, or in many instances quantity, of one outcome merely by observing a complementary event without actually having to sample on the inferred one.  Risk minimization is also a key concept in ﬁnancial and insurance markets. Hedging, the process of combining multiple positions in different assets to reduce total risk in a portfolio is a common risk minimization strategy in ﬁnancial investments (Jorion, 2009). Modern portfolio theory (MPT) (Markowitz, 1952) formalizes the concept of risk-spreading and relies upon correlations between multiple assets to specify how they can be most efﬁciently combined to maximize returns and minimize risk. Research in decision neuroscience provides extensive evidence for a neural representation of key decision variables (Doya, 2008) with a focus heretofore on value signals, putative inputs to the decision process such as action or goal values, and representations of expected outcome after a choice (Hampton et al., 2006; Knutson et al., 2005; Lau and Glimcher, 2007; Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006; Plassmann et al., 2007; Samejima et al., 2005; Wunderlich et al., 2009, 2010). There is now good evidence that fundamental computational mechanisms underlying valuebased learning and decision-making are well captured by reinforcement learning algorithms (Sutton and Barto, 1998) where option values are updated on a trial by trial basis via prediction errors (PE) (Knutson and Cooper, 2005; Montague and Berns, 2002; O’Doherty et al., 2004; Schultz et al., 1997). More recently, there is an emergent literature that suggests the brain not only tracks outcome value, but also uncertainty (Huettel et al., 2006; Platt and Huettel, 2008) and higher statistical moments of outcomes such as variance (Christopoulos et al., 2009; Mohr et al., 2010; Preuschoff et al., 2006, 2008; Tobler et al., 2009) and skewness (Symmonds et al., 2010).  An important component of outcomes, namely the statistical relationship between multiple outcomes, and what neural mechanisms might support acquisition of this higher-order structure has remained unexplored. In principle, there are several plausible  Neuron 71, 1141–1152, September 22, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc. 1141  A  -0.4  1.4  15  -0.4  30  26  1.4  Neuron  Learning Reward Correlations  B  2.0  1.5  w     i    t h g e w e c r u o s e r  1.0  0.5  0  −0.4 correlation coefficient  0.4  0  0.8  choice screen  5 sec  ζ = td1 x td2        σ1 x σ2  C  40  d t  0  −40  −0.5  −1.0  −0.8  1 - 6 sec  outcome screen  3 sec  ITI  1-6 sec  ρ = ρ+αζ  wind  sun  w = f(ρ)  rmix  0.8  ζ/ρ  −0.8  Figure 1. Experimental Design (A) Subjects were presented with a slider to set portfolio weights that determine the fraction of each resource (wind or solar power) in the energy mix (screen 1). The weights could be set within the range from  1 to 2, with a ﬁxed relationship that both weights always add up to 1, i.e., wwind = 1   wsun. The trial outcome  (screen 2) displayed the individual resource values for sun and wind, and the portfolio value of the combined mix (calculated by the weights from screen 1). (B) Optimal portfolio weight wsun (wwind = 1 – wsun) increases as a function of the correlation coefﬁcient between sun and wind outcomes. The background color indicates portfolio standard deviation (blue = small SD, red = large SD). Optimal portfolio weights (for variance minimization) are displayed as white line, the gray lines indicate the 10% interval around the optimal choice (a deviation of that amount from the optimal weights would result in a 10% higher SD). (C) The correlation estimate r (red line) is updated from trial to trial (x axis) via a correlation prediction error z (green stems) and then in a second step used to allocate weights in every trial. Zeta is calculated as the cross-product between the two resource outcome prediction errors (gray bars). The correlation coefﬁcient that was used to generate the data in this illustration is  0.60 during the ﬁrst ten trials and afterward changes to +0.80 (dashed line). Learning of r from z is depicted here for a learning rate of 0.2.  mechanisms including the deployment of simple reinforcement learning to form individual associative links (Thorndike, 1911), or a more sophisticated approach that generates decisions based upon estimates of outcome correlation strengths. If the latter strategy is indeed the one implemented by the brain then this entails a separate encoding of correlations and corresponding prediction errors beyond that of action values and outcomes. Here, we address the question of how humans learn the relationship between multiple rewards when making choices. We ﬁtted a series of computational models to subjects’ behavior and found that a model based on correlation learning best explained subjects’ responses. Furthermore, we found evidence for a neural representation of correlation learning evident in the expression of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in right medial insula that increased linearly with the correlation coefﬁcient between two resources, a normalized measure of the strength of their statistical relationship. A correlation prediction error signal, needed to provide an update on those estimates, was represented in rostral anterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal sulcus. These behavioral and neural data provide evidence that subjects learn the correlative strength between rewards and are able to use this information to make risk-optimal choices.  RESULTS  To investigate how humans learn correlations between outcomes we scanned 16 subjects using fMRI while they performed a ‘‘resource management’’ game. This task invoked a scenario whereby a power company generates ﬂuctuating amounts of electricity from two renewable energy sources, a solar plant and a wind park. We instructed subjects to create an energy portfolio under a speciﬁc goal constraint necessitating keeping the total energy output as constant as possible (Figure 1A). Subjects accomplished this by adjusting weights that determined how the two resources were linearly combined. A normative best performance is achievable by ﬁnding a solution that exploits knowledge of the covariance structure of these resources (Figure 1B), a task design that approximates a simple portfolio problem in ﬁnance. Importantly, the outcomes of the two resources covaried with each other and this correlation between the two outcomes changed probabilistically over time, requiring subjects to continuously update their estimate of the current correlation structure. This task is well suited for assessing subjects’ estimate of the correlation strength because a good performance is only accomplished if subjects learn both the distribution of returns for each resource as well as their  1142 Neuron 71, 1141–1152, September 22, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Learning Reward Correlations  A  800  600  C B  I  400  200  0  B  N / 1  i  g n n r a e l  Q     e c i o h c m o d n a r     L R e c n e d i c n o c  i  i  w o d n w g n d  i     i l s     L R n o i t a e r r o c  l  7 7  .  1 7  .  1 6  .  9 4  .  6 2  .  r2     j  t c e b u s   y b n e s o h c   t h g e w  i  2  1  0  −1  0  −1 2 model predicted weight  1  C  2*rw-rs  .5*rw+.5*rs  −rw+2*rs  20  40  trial  60  80  Figure 2.

We rewarded participants according to how stable they kept the total output of their mixed energy portfolio relative to the variance resulting from an optimal strategy (speciﬁed by MPT-calculated optimal weights).  Behavioral Model Comparison We speculated that subjects might solve the task by learning the correlative strength between the resources via a correlation prediction error, calculated from the cross-product of the individual resources’ outcome prediction errors (Figure 1C). This envisages that subjects represent a continuous measure of outcome correlation and update this metric on a trial-by-trial basis. To rule out alternative strategies we examined other computational models that could be used to guide choice in our task, and ﬁtted the free parameters of each model to get model predicted portfolio weights that most closely resembled the actual responses for each subject.  One such alternative model-based strategy is to exploit trialby-trial evidence to update a representation of the portfolio weights directly instead of ﬁrst estimating the correlation coefﬁcient. Similar to correlation learning, this model makes assumptions about the structure of the task and uses individual resource outcomes as a basis for learning. The main difference between the covariance based model and this model is that in the former,  subjects update an estimate of the correlation via a prediction error and then translate this correlation strength into taskspeciﬁc weights on every trial, whereas in the latter the estimates of task-dependent weights (i.e., the position on the response slider) are learned directly. This differentiation is important because the correlation coefﬁcient is a normalized and therefore universal measure of the interdependence between the two outcomes, whereas appropriate mixing weights are taskspeciﬁc and would need to be relearned if the variances of the individual outcome change or the goal of the task changes from risk minimization to maximization. Both of these strategies are model-based as they require an understanding of how the two individual outcomes interact. There are other potential modes of learning that we also consider. For example, subjects might implement a more simple model-free reinforcement learning based on Q-learning of action values for increasing or decreasing the weights. In contrast to the former approaches requiring subjects to attend to the individual resource outcomes, a subject who updates action values in this model-free way would instead consider the mixed portfolio outcome in every trial and try to minimize its temporal ﬂuctuation using simple outcome based updating. Any change in behavior following a change in correlation between resources would then be due to a relearning of a new optimal mix of actions rather than a more complete knowledge of the structure of the environment. Finally, subjects might use a heuristic of detecting coincidences in the occurrence between outcomes, without a full representation of the strength of correlation.  Out of all tested models, the model based on tracking the correlation coefﬁcient best predicted subjects’ behavior (Figure 2A and Table 1). The weights estimated by this model match subjects’ behavior very well, as shown by a comparison of model predictions and subjects’ actual choices (Figure 2B) with the regression of actual observed weights on model predicted weights being highly signiﬁcant in every individual subject (p < 0.0001; average R2 [standard coefﬁcient of determination] across subjects = 0.77; see Table S1 available online). In fact, subjects’ responses approximated normatively optimal portfolio weights while subjects attempted to keep the total energy output stable (minimize variance) (Figure 2C). Both model predicted and subjects’ actual responses approach normatively optimal weights with some lag, the latter resulting from a need to have multiple observations to reliably detect any change in correlation strength. In effect, subjects’ strategy of determining the correlation approximately compared to a normative calculation of the correlation coefﬁcient over the outcomes of the past ten trials.  representation of  Neural Representation of the Correlation Strength If the brain learns the relationship between two rewards by estimating their covariance then this predicts that we should observe a neural the computations that support this process. Consequently, we tested for fMRI signals that track the covariance or correlation strength, and because the outputs vary, there should also be a signal that updates this information. Based on prior evidence, we predicted activity related to covariance would be seen in insular cortex or striatum, areas implicated in encoding the risk or variance of individual outcomes (Preuschoff et al., 2006, 2008).

We found BOLD activity in right midinsula varied with the correlation strength between the outputs of the solar and wind power plants (xyz = 48, 5,  5; Z = 4.12; p < 0.001 familywise error (FWE) corrected; Figure 3A). Right insula was the only region to survive cluster level whole brain correction and we provide a comprehensive list of all activated areas at a lower threshold (p < 0.001 uncorrected) in Table 2.  We next determined whether the correlation strength is represented either as covariance, a raw measure of how much the two variables ﬂuctuate together, or as the correlation coefﬁcient, a scale invariant metric of the covariance normalized by the standard deviation of each resource. We estimated two additional models using Bayesian estimation, with either the covariance or the correlation coefﬁcient as parametric modulator, and compared the ensuing log-evidence maps in a random effects analysis. Activity in right midinsula was better described by the correlation coefﬁcient than by covariance (exceedance probability of p > 0.999). The linear relationship between correlation coefﬁcient and BOLD is visualized in a binned effect size plot (Figure 3B).  We then veriﬁed whether this signal was more strongly represented at the time of outcome, when new evidence is available to update estimates, or at choice when subjects actively readjust their allocated weights for the two resources (Figure 3C). In addition to plotting the effect time course we tested these neural hypotheses by estimating a design where the correlation coefﬁcient acted as an unorthogonalized parametric modulator of activity at both the time of outcome and time of choice. In this analysis we observed signiﬁcant effects of correlation strength solely at the outcome time (Z = 3.60, p = 0.01 FWE corrected) but not at the time of choice (Z = 2.40, p = 0.02 uncorrected).  If our behavioral model explains subject’s choices and subjects’ brain activity represents crucial decision variables in this process then we would expect that brain activity should be particularly well explained in those subjects in whom our model also provides a good choice prediction. This would be expressed in a relationship between the behavioral model ﬁt and the model ﬁt in the general linear model (GLM) against BOLD data. Consistent with our conjecture, we found a signiﬁcant positive correlation between R2 in the behavioral model and R2 in the MRI analysis (r = 0.50, p < 0.03; Figure 3D). In effect, this conﬁrms that our model explains a larger proportion of the ﬂuctuation in the neuronal data in those subjects in which the model can also well explain choices.  Neural Correlates of Correlation Prediction Errors A neural representation of correlation strength in our task entails that this estimate is updated over time, a process ascribed to a prediction error signal. Analogous to risk prediction errors for individual rewards (Preuschoff et al., 2008), the cross-products of the two outcome prediction errors provide a trial-by-trial estimate of the covariance strength. Using this regressor we found that a correlation prediction error was tracked in fMRI activity in left rostral cingulate cortex (xyz =  15, 44, 7; Z = 4.87; p < 0.003 FWE corrected; Figure 4 and Table 2).  From Correlation to Portfolio Weights After observing an outcome, participants may have an imperative to change the slider position if their currently set weights deviate from the estimated new best weights, in other words if they are suboptimal. We tested for a signal corresponding to the absolute (i.e., unsigned) deviation between current and new weights on the next trial and found corresponding BOLD activity in a region encompassing anterior cingulate (ACC)/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) (xyz = 6, 26, 34; Z = 4.22; p < 0.001 FWE corrected) and in right anterior insula (xyz = 42,  1144 Neuron 71, 1141–1152, September 22, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Learning Reward Correlations  A  R  6  5  4  3  2  1  z = -5  T-score  B  e g n a h C    l  a n g S %  i     C  .  ) . u a (   e z i s   t c e f f E  −0.02  −0.06  −0.10  low  high correlation  low  high  covariance  D  0.12  0.1  i r  m  f   2 R  0.08  0.06  0.04  0.4  0.6  0.8  R2 behavior  choice  outcome  Figure 3.

Each dot represents one subject and the line is the regression slope.  23,  5; Z = 4.04; p < 0.04 FWE corrected) at the time of the outcome (Figure 5 and Table 2). In contrast, no areas corresponded directly to the portfolio weight values or a signed updating of weights, signals one would expect if subjects performed learning over task-speciﬁc weights instead of the correlation structure between outcomes.  Finally, an optimal solution to our task requires learning of the individual outcome variances in addition to learning the covariance structure. When we tested for neural activity coupled to local temporal ﬂuctuations in the individual outcome variances we replicated previous ﬁndings in highlighting a neural representations of outcome risk in striatum (xyz =  18, 5, 10; Z = 3.81; p = 0.04 small volume corrected; Figure S3).  Alternative Model Considerations As an alternative to learning the correlation coefﬁcient subjects might directly learn the weight representation and perform RL over the weights instead of the correlation coefﬁcient. If that were the case then one would also expect to ﬁnd a neuronal representation of the weights and weight prediction errors, which were conspicuously absent in our data. Another possibility could be that subjects simpliﬁed the problem to detecting outcome coincidences (both outcomes either above or below mean versus one outcome above and the other below mean) instead of fully quantifying the trial-by-trial covariance. In that case we would expect to ﬁnd a neural signal pertaining to mere outcome coincidences. We found no activations coupled to either the weight or the weight prediction errors, or the trial-by-trial coincidences anywhere in the brain at our omnibus cluster level threshold of p < 0.05. Together with the inferior behavioral ﬁt of the coincidence model this suggests that subjects quantiﬁed the trial by-trial relationship between outcomes. We also implemented a model-free Q-learning algorithm as further alternative strategy, which was clearly outperformed by the correlation model.  DISCUSSION  We show that human subjects are adept at learning correlations between two dynamic variables, a process also represented neurally. Subjects were highly effective at exploiting this key metric of the statistical relationship between the two individual resources to guide choice in a task requiring minimization of outcome ﬂuctuations. This ﬁnding is in contrast to an oftenproposed model in behavioral ﬁnance, which suggests disregarding environmental structure and using ﬁxed weights according to the 1/N rule (Benartzi and Thaler, 2001). Our subjects performed better than this simple heuristic and learned a more optimal strategy through repeated observations. At a neural level, fMRI signals in right midinsula were coupled to the current correlation coefﬁcient, whereas activity in rostral anterior cingulate encoded a correlation prediction error, a signal used to update an estimate of the correlation strength based on new evidence in every trial.  Although learning individual outcomes is a central part of decision making, the availabilities of different rewards are rarely independent of each other in a natural environment. Our results provide evidence that subjects also learn the relationship between multiple outcomes by tracking their correlation, and this information can be used to decrease overall sampling risk. Commonly observed risk aversion in animals (Kacelnik and Bateson, 1996) and humans (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981) is rational in an evolutionary context, as a small but constant supply  Neuron 71, 1141–1152, September 22, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc. 1145  Table 2.

In some other instances, riskseeking behavior may occur, such as in gamblers, and may promote exploration and learning. Note, however, that also in that case a representation of the correlation in the environmental structure is beneﬁcial, as this information can be used both for risk minimization or maximization.  To generalize our results to more natural situations, we have to ascertain that the ﬁndings reﬂect a speciﬁc mechanism of  correlation learning instead of incidental task variables. Plausible possibilities include shortcuts such as learning the position on the response slider by a model-free gradient descent mechanism or using a model-based strategy, but without representing individual outcome variances and normalized correlation coefﬁcients and instead directly learning a representation of the portfolio weights. Our behavioral and neural data render all these explanations very unlikely. The best-ﬁtting learning rate for outcome variance is similar to the learning rate for correlation and signiﬁcantly above the one for value for each individual  1146 Neuron 71, 1141–1152, September 22, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Learning Reward Correlations  A  R  B  e g n a h C    l     a n g S %  i  R    0.00  −0.04  −0.08  low  high  correlation PE  z = -4  x = 3  z = 7  Figure 4.

Importantly, we ensured that the signals in our study were not spurious reﬂections of the individual variances of solar and wind plant outputs by explicitly modeling these signals with additional (unorthogonalized) parametric regressors. A ﬂuctuating trial-by-trial estimate of the outcome variance is also represented neurally in striatum (Figure S3), an area previously implicated in variance learning (Preuschoff et al., 2006). Although these neural signatures of risk and risk prediction errors were somewhat weaker compared to covariance signals, we suggest this observation is due to an amalgamation of signals tracking the two separate resource variances within the same area, and because the variance of the two outcomes ﬂuctuated only slightly over the course of each experimental block. Importantly, we found no signiﬁcant correlations with signals pertaining to alternative decision models anywhere in the brain at p < 0.05 corrected. Speciﬁcally, we examined if there was evidence for a direct representation of desired resource weights, or weight prediction errors, signals one would expect instead of the correlation coefﬁcient if subjects used a more task-speciﬁc strategy. We also did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant correlations with a more qualitative measure of coincidences instead of fully quantiﬁed correlations. Together with a superior behavioral ﬁt of the correlation learning model, this strongly supports the speciﬁcity of our neural results and effectively discounts the possibility that the observed activations here relate to incidental task related learning processes instead of learning the correlation between outcomes.  We found that anterior insula tracked the correlation strength between the outputs in a site slightly posterior to regions previously implicated in tracking variance (Mohr et al., 2010; Preuschoff et al., 2008). Combined, these ﬁndings suggest that insular cortex may support a general role in processing statistical information about the environment. At the same time, anterior insula has been implicated in representing bodily states and their translation into feelings and possibly awareness (Craig, 2009). Note that the calculus-like role proposed here does not contradict the idea that anterior insula represents subjective aspects of experience. Indeed, the somatic marker hypothesis postu Figure 5. Absolute Weight Updates Activity in ACC/DMPFC and anterior insula correlated, at the time of the outcome screen, with the absolute amount that subjects update the resource allocation weights during the following choice.  lates that rational decision theory requires emotional anticipation of outcomes (Bechara et al., 1997), such that seemingly prudent behavior and emotional decision making are intertwined (Paulus et al., 2003). The ﬁnding of a slightly posterior encoding of correlation relative to risk also tallies with a structural model for how unconscious state representations might be integrated into a sentient self along a posterior to anterior insula (Craig, 2009). Adequate emotional risk assessment is immediately relevant for ﬁght or ﬂight responses and might therefore require a more direct link to awareness then the meta parameters of how multiple such variables relate to each other (Bossaerts, 2010). The latter assessment is largely subconscious and may, as implicit function, also be enacted during low-level processing of multidimensional stimuli such as music and rhythm. Interestingly, such tasks have previously been associated with insula activation (Koelsch et al., 2006; Platel et al., 1997). Our data show that the brain encodes the correlation coefﬁcient of two outcomes, a normalized value, instead of the covariance itself. In light of previous data (Bunzeck et al., 2010; Padoa-Schioppa, 2009; Seymour and McClure, 2008), this hints that scale invariance is a ubiquitous concept in encoding decision variables in the brain.  The representation of a prediction error in anterior cingulate ﬁts neatly with mounting evidence that this area is involved in learning and behavioral control. Several previous studies report a role for anterior cingulate in an error-driven reinforcement learning system (Kennerley et al., 2006), and in prediction errors for actions (Matsumoto et al., 2007) or social value (Behrens et al., 2008). Together with risk prediction errors in anterior insula (Preuschoff et al., 2008), this teaching signal for correlation strength might belong to a broader system involved in learning the statistical properties of the environment.  We also observed an anticipatory signal reﬂecting an impetus to shift resource allocations on the next trial in order to keep the total energy output stable. Interestingly, this signal was expressed in a DMPFC cluster previously linked to updating learning in relation to environmental volatility (Behrens et al., 2007), implying a more general role for this region in adapting behavior to ﬂuctuations in the statistical characteristics of the environment. Most task-modulated activity, including correlation strength, its prediction error, and a signal reﬂecting the need to  Neuron 71, 1141–1152, September 22, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc. 1147  alter responses, occurred at the time of outcome rather than at choice. This suggests that task-relevant computations, including an evaluation of the appropriate action to take after each outcome, occur at the point when individuals can best harvest new evidence. As we focused on the mechanism of learning the correlation strength, rather than on how subjects use this information, this raises the question of how exactly information about a covariance structure is applied in a natural sampling environment. Here, we instantiated this mapping of correlation coefﬁcients into energy resource weights by using the normative function derived from MPT. We assume subjects learned the form of this nonlinear transformation during initial training, but it remains a question for future research how this translation is applied. Based on our present results and previous ﬁndings that the brain encodes other statistical parameters such as variance and skewness of outcomes (Preuschoff et al., 2008; Symmonds et al., 2010), we speculate that in more naturalistic environments subjects form structural representations of the world by encoding summary statistical parameters. Such a parameterized representation is both efﬁcient and ﬂexible: the optimal response is dependent upon three parameters—the magnitude, available resources—and knowledge of the individual parameters allows fast adaptation in light of changes to any one of them. One way to expand our research to more natural situations could be by changing the cost function to mimic an ecological survival game with perishable outcomes. Such a paradigm would allow one to determine if subjects indeed follow a variance minimizing strategy and incorporate information about reward correlations. The recent ﬁnancial crisis has amply demonstrated that even experts have difﬁculties regulating correlated risks in the ﬁnancial domain and investors often deviate from rationality when making ﬁnancial decisions (Daniel et al., 2002; Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005). In contrast, we show here that individuals are adept at detecting and responding to correlations and appropriately selecting actions to minimize risk in an intricate learning task. Indeed, this exquisite sensitivity taps into an adaptive and evolutionary conserved ability of implicit neurobiological systems to learn environmental reward structure through trialby-trial sampling; intrinsic behavior that might even supersede that of ﬁnancial experts deciding about explicitly described statistics.  and correlation  variance  of  the  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Subjects Sixteen healthy subjects (7 female; 18–35 years old) with no history of neurological or psychiatric illness participated in the study. Two additional pilot subjects from the lab were excluded from the ﬁnal analysis, as they were already familiar with the hypotheses in the experiment. The study was approved by the Institute of Neurology (University College London) Research Ethics Committee.  Task To investigate whether and how subjects learn the reward structure in the environment we designed a portfolio-mixing task in which knowledge of the correlation between two resource outcomes could improve performance. Subjects’ task was to keep the combined output of two power stations as stable as possible (i.e., minimize the variance of an energy portfolio) by mixing the ﬂuctuating outcomes of these two individual resources. They accom Neuron  Learning Reward Correlations  plished this by adjusting weights that determined how the resources were linearly combined. A normative best performance is achievable in this task by ﬁnding a solution that directly depends on knowledge of the covariance structure of these resources, a task design that approximates a simple portfolio problem in ﬁnance (Markowitz, 1952).  We presented the task to subjects as a resource management game that invoked a scenario whereby a power company generates ﬂuctuating amounts of electricity from two renewable energy sources, a solar plant and a wind park. The resource outputs rsun and rwind were drawn as random numbers in every trial from distributions with a common mean M and variances s2 sun and s2 wind. Importantly, the two outcomes covaried with each other, and the strength of this correlation changed probabilistically over time. This feature encouraged subjects to form an estimate about the mean and variance of the individual outcomes and continually update their assumption about the correlation strength.  Subjects participated in three consecutive experimental blocks, each corresponding to a 21 min long session in an fMRI scanner (Siemens Trio 3T). They were instructed that the correlation would probabilistically change over the course of the study but were not given further details about speciﬁc parameters used. We also told subjects that the mean and variance of the two resources would remain constant over one block of the experiment, a simpliﬁcation to an otherwise quite complex task that enabled subjects to perform well within the settings of this experiment. As our goal was to assess covariance learning (in contrast to learning the values and risk) this did not adversely impact on any mechanism we wanted to observe. However, mean and variance values were different for each block. To give subjects the opportunity to learn these basic statistical parameters (mean and variance) before making portfolio choices, we presented them with a 20-trial observation phase at the beginning of each session. In this phase, which immediately preceded the start of fMRI data acquisition, subjects only observed the individual outcomes of the two resources and did not make any choices. There was no change in the ground truth correlation during this phase. Data from pilot studies and model simulations conﬁrmed that 20 observations of a time series were sufﬁcient to form an estimate of its mean and variance. The observation phase was followed by 84 choice trials, consisting of a 5 s choice period and a 3 s outcome period, separated by a blank gray screen of 1–6 s duration (uniform distribution). The intertrial-interval was also 1–6 s (Figure 1A).  The portfolio weights (wsun, wwind) indicate how much of a fraction the portfolio contains from both resources rsun and rwind (portfolio outcome value Vp = wsun*rsun + wwind*rwind). Subjects were allowed to set the portfolio weight wsun within a range between  1 and 2. Setting negative weights allowed subjects to trade-in a fraction of the trials output from one resource in exchange for multiplying the other output by the same fraction. This concept echoes the possibility of short selling in ﬁnancial markets and is important for this task as it permits risk minimizing for positively correlated resources (see the section on variance minimizing strategies in the Supplemental Information for further details). The constraint that both weights always add up to 1 automatically  determined the weight of the other resource (wwind = 1   wsun). A horizontal  line on the choice screen represented the slider during the choice period and icons of a solar and wind plant on both ends indicated which resources were mixed in the portfolio. The parts of the slider involving a negative weight were red and the middle part with both positive weights was shown in white with the center position corresponding to a mix with equal weights. A yellow dot on the slider indicated the current position and portfolio weights were additionally shown numerically next to the resource icon. Subjects were able to make responses during the entire 5 s choice period by pressing two buttons on a button box with their right hand. Each button press moved the current slider position a discrete step of 0.1 units in either direction. Moving the slider a step toward the right always increased the weight for sun and decreased the weight for wind. A new choice period started with the portfolio weights from the last trial and subjects were allowed to freely move the slider as many steps in either direction as they wished during the choice period. Importantly, subjects always had to determine the weights for the current trial prior to seeing the actual outcome. Due to inherent stochastic outcomes, and because serial outcomes were independently drawn, the only rational strategy was to set the weights in a way that would yield the least portfolio variance in the long run and this measure depended on the current correlation.  1148 Neuron 71, 1141–1152, September 22, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Learning Reward Correlations  To determine subjects’ performance we benchmarked their portfolio ﬂuctuation against the ﬂuctuation of a portfolio with optimal weights. The normative solution was calculated by the risk minimizing formula of portfolio theory (see Supplemental Information for details). This ensured that subjects were fairly scored given the stochastic outcomes on a trial-by-trial basis (i.e., even if subjects played optimally the portfolio outcome would ﬂuctuate around the target with the amount of ﬂuctuation dependent on the current covariance). Subjects received reimbursement of 10» ﬂat plus a fraction of the maximum bonus of 45» in relation to task performance (Table S1). All participants received basic instructive information about hedging strategies (similar to the Supplemental Information variance minimization strategies and Figure S2) and practiced the task (same number of trials than in the fMRI study but with different parameters for outcome mean and variance) on a separate day prior to scanning. Note, however, that all instructions concerned exclusively how to set portfolio weights (i.e., how to respond) but not how to learn correlations itself. Therefore this latter process cannot be confounded by the explicit information given here. The reason for using a seemingly intricate portfolio task over having subjects merely report the correlation directly is that explicit assessments of decision variables by self-report are often biased (Kagel and Roth, 1997). Our procedure is in this respect very similar to other commonly used behavioral measures such as auction bidding (Becker et al., 1964; Plassmann et al., 2007) to identify subjects’ unbiased value preference. Another advantage of our task is that response behavior does not depend on individually subjective valuation or risk preference. Performance and payout were only related to how close subjects’ behavior matched the normative optimal solution (thereby incentivizing an accurate correlation representation) but was independent of the actual amount or variance of the produced energy mix. Importantly, during the experiment subjects never received direct feedback on their performance at minimizing energy ﬂuctuations (i.e., only saw trial-bytrial outcomes) and the bonus and optimal weights were only revealed after the experiment. We omitted feedback during the task to prevent subjects from using a strategy that is based on optimizing the performance feedback instead of learning the correlation of the individual outcomes. Although the portfolio value is shown on every trial, and the deviance of this value from its mean gives some hints to performance, this is only a crude measure of whether the current weights are good because even with optimal weights the amount of portfolio ﬂuctuation depends on the current correlation.  Because the optimal mixing weights (portfolio weights) in our task depend on individual variance from solar and wind power plants and their correlation strength, the best strategy is to learn the variances and correlations by observation of individual outcomes and then translate these estimates into an optimal resource allocation (i.e., weightings). Although subjects could learn the statistical properties underlying outcome generation by observation, the outcomes of individual trials were unpredictable. Their task was then to continuously mix the two resources into an energy portfolio and thereby minimize the ﬂuctuation of the portfolio value from trial to trial.  Generation of Outcome Values Both resources ﬂuctuated around a common mean, with outcomes drawn from a rectangular distribution with a speciﬁc variance. In our task the standard deviation of one resource was always twice that of the other because this maximized the inﬂuence of the correlation on the portfolio weights (see Figure S1 for details). The sequence of correlated random numbers for the two resources were generated by the Cholesky decomposition method (Gentle, 1998). This was realized by ﬁrst drawing random numbers xA and xB for resources A, B from a rectangular distribution. The outcome of the second resource xB was then modiﬁed as xB = xA * r + xB* sqrt(1   r2), whereby r is the generative correlation coefﬁcient. Finally, xA and xB were normalized to their desired standard deviations (in the three blocks: 20/10, 15/30, 10/20) and common means (30, 50, 40). We chose a rectangular distribution to increase the sensitivity of our fMRI experiment in ﬁnding neural correlates of covariance and covariance prediction errors as the linear regression against BOLD activity is most sensitive if the values of the parametric modulators are distributed along their entire range. This is not true for normal distributed outcomes, which have proportionally the largest amounts of data close to the mean. We varied the generative correlation strength in discrete steps of  0.99,  0.3, 0.4, 0.7, 0.95, and 0.999. The observable correlation through sampling  by the subject will, however, very on a continuous scale also between these steps due to Stochasticity in the outcomes. A change from the current to a new correlation was determined probabilistically in every trial with a p = 0.3 transition probability, under the constraint that a change would only occur after the new correlation became theoretically detectable by an ideal observer that was tracking the correlation coefﬁcient in a sliding window over the past ﬁve trials. In detail, after the normatively estimated correlation based on the last ﬁve trials (similar to the sliding window model below) approached the new generative correlation (with a deviation <0.2), the correlation was allowed to change on all further trials. This prevented overly rapid changes in the generative correlation before subjects could have possibly detected the new correlation coefﬁcient from outcome observations. On average (across subjects and sessions) the correlations changed every ten trials. To discourage subjects from persevering on a more favorable spot of the response scale that would give a reasonable result over a wider range of correlations, and instead be forced to track the correlation explicitly, we further implemented an adaptive rule that if subjects’ response was both suboptimal (farther from the optimum than 0.2) and they did not change their response within the past ﬁve trials then the correlation would jump to the farthest extreme (either  0.99 or +0.999). This increased the penalty on subjects payout at their current weights and encouraged them to ﬁnd a better weight allocation. In practice, this constraint came rarely (never for 10 subjects, one or two occurrences in ﬁve, and three occurrences in one subject) into use during the fMRI experiment.  Correlation Learning Model We modeled trial-by-trial values of the correlation strength by using principles of reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998). Reinforcement learning generates in every trial a prediction error as the deviation of the experienced outcome R from the predicted outcome. Those prediction errors, multiplied by the learning rate, are then used to update predictions in future trials:  and  resource value: Vi;t + 1 = Vi;t + aVdi;t;  value prediction error: di;t = R   Vi;t:  (1)  (2)  The squared prediction error is also a measure of the outcome ﬂuctuation and thereby a quantiﬁer of risk. A sequence of continuously large prediction errors indicates that the outcomes greatly ﬂuctuate, whereby a sequence of small prediction errors indicate that prediction is precise with little deviation. We used this to model the risk h for both resources:  and  resource variance: hi;t + 1 = hi;t + aR  εi;t;  variance prediction error: εi;t = d2 i;t    hi;t:  (3)  (4)  We then extended this model from independent outcomes to the interaction of outcomes, whereby the product of the individual prediction errors measures the covariation of two outcomes:  resource covariance: covt + 1 = covt + aCz  t  ;  and  covariance prediction error: zt = hs1;t hs2;t   covt:  (5)  (6)  The correlation coefﬁcient r was then deﬁned as the covariance normalized  by the individual standard deviations of the two involved outcomes:  resource correlation : r  =  t  covt  ðsqrtðhs1;tÞ  sqrtðhs2;tÞÞ:  (7)  In every trial the correlation coefﬁcient was ﬁnally translated into a position on the response slider using the normative function (h2,t – covt)/(h1,t + h2,t – 2 * covt), which is derived in the Supplemental Information. This relationship (Figure S1) did not change over the entire course of the experiment (because we always used the same ratio of 1:2 between outcome s).  We kept the mean of the resource outcomes constant during each session and therefore the optimal strategy was indeed to not update those variables  Neuron 71, 1141–1152, September 22, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc. 1149  once a reliable estimate had been formed during the observation phase of each block. In fact, the best-ﬁtting learning rate for resource values was consistently very small across subjects (average 0.08), conﬁrming that, as intended by the design, subjects indeed treated the mean as a stable value after the initial observation period and adjusted their learning rate downward to reﬂect this steady nature (Behrens et al., 2007).  We investigated whether subjects used different learning rates for variance and covariance learning or whether these processes could be described by a single parameter. We did this by comparing a model with separate parameters for variance and covariance learning with a model that used a common parameter for both learning processes. We found that the reduced model could describe learning as well as the full model if model complexity is considered (Table 1). Note that both overall mean value and variance were constant during the experiment but the best-ﬁtting learning rate for variance was higher than for value. This suggests that, in contrast to mean outcome value, subjects continuously updated their estimate of individual risk in response to local temporal ﬂuctuations in the individual variances.  We therefore used the reduced model with a common risk/covariance learning parameter to generate fMRI regressors. Parameter estimates were ﬁt for every individual subject using least-squares minimization between model predicted weights and actual weights set by the subject (see below).  Alternative Models We created several alternative models that do not require learning of covariance information. Those models are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.  Model Comparison We compared how well each model predicted subjects’ behavior by ﬁtting the free parameters of each model such that the mean squared sum of the deviation between model predicted (wm) and subjects’ weights (ws) was minimized. As measure of model ﬁt we then calculated the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) as  BIC = 2L + k lnðnÞ;  and  0 BB@logð2pÞ + log  0 BB@    Pn  i    2  1 CCA + 1  1 CCA;  i   wm ws  i  n  L = 1 2  n  (8)  (9)  where L is the negative log likelihood function, n = 252 trials and k the number of free model parameters (Table 1). We also calculated a generalized r2-statistics for each model, which is a standardized measure of model ﬁt analogous to accounted variance (Nagelkerke, 1991). It is computed as r2 = 1   L=Lrandom.  Stimuli Stimuli were presented on a gray background using Cogent 2000 (http://www. vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent.php) running in MATLAB. Stimuli were presented using an LCD projector running at a refresh rate of 60 Hz, viewed by subjects via an adjustable mirror.    FMRI Data Acquisition Data were acquired with a 3T scanner (Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel phased array head coil. Functional images were taken with a gradient echo T2*-weighted echo-planar sequence (TR = 3.128 s, ﬂip , TE = 30 ms, 64 3 64 matrix). Whole brain coverage was achieved angle = 90 by taking 46 slices in ascending order (2 mm thickness, 1 mm gap, in-plane resolution 3 3 3 mm), tilted in an oblique orientation at  30 to minimize signal dropout in ventrolateral and medial frontal cortex (Weiskopf et al., 2006). Subjects’ head was restrained with foam pads to limit head movement during acquisition. Functional imaging data were acquired in three separate 415-volume runs, each lasting about 21 min. The ﬁrst ﬁve volumes of each run were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. A B0-ﬁeldmap (double-echo FLASH, TE1 = 10 ms, TE2 = 12.46 ms, 3 3 3 3 2 mm resolution) and a highresolution T1-weighted anatomical scan of the whole brain (MDEFT sequence, 1 3 1 3 1 mm resolution) were also acquired for each subject.    Neuron  Learning Reward Correlations  FMRI Data Analysis Image analysis was performed using SPM8 (rev. 3911; http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl. ac.uk/spm). EPI images were realigned and unwarped using ﬁeld maps (Andersson et al., 2001). Each subject’s T1 image was segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid, and the segmentation parameters were used to warp the T1 image to the SPM Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. These normalization parameters were then applied to the functional data. Finally, the normalized images were spatially smoothed using an isotropic 8-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel.  FMRI time series were regressed onto a composite general linear model (GLM) containing regressors representing the time of the choice, the time of the outcome screen, and any button presses during the choice period. The outcome regressor was modulated by a number of model derived decision variables. Modulators for outcome were: prediction errors for the individual resource outcomes and the portfolio outcome (d1, d2, dp), the absolute deviation of the portfolio outcome from the target (jdpj), resource risk (h1, h2), risk prediction errors (ε1, ε2), the correlation strength of the resources (r), and the correlation prediction error (z). A further modulator captured the anticipated magnitude of actual weight updating in the next trial (jwt   wt+1j). In contrast  to the default procedure in SPM, we entered all regressors and modulators independently (without serial orthogonalization) into the design matrix. Thereby only the additional variance that cannot be explained by any other regressor is assigned to the effect, preventing spurious confounds between regressors (Andrade et al., 1999; Draper and Smith, 1998). Speciﬁcally, this ensured that the observed effects of correlation strength and correlation prediction error are solely accountable by effects not explained by signals relating to the variance of individual outcomes.  The regressors were convolved with the canonical HRF, and low frequency drifts were excluded with a high-pass ﬁlter (128 s cutoff). Short-term temporal autocorrelations were modeled using an AR(1) process. Motion correction regressors estimated from the realignment procedure were entered as covariates of no interest. Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using linear compounds of the regressors in the GLM, generating statistical parametric maps (SPM) of t values across the brain for each subject and contrast of interest. These contrast images were then entered into a second-level random-effects analysis using a one-sample t test against zero.  Anatomical  localization was carried out by overlaying the t-maps on a normalized structural image averaged across subjects, and with reference to an anatomical atlas (Duvernoy, 1999). All coordinates are reported in MNI space (Mazziotta et al., 2001). Unless otherwise noted, all statistics are FWE corrected at the cluster level for multiple comparisons at p < 0.05 with a height threshold of p < 0.001 (using the cluster level statistics implementation within SPM). Small volume correction in the outcome variance contrast for striatum was performed within a 12 mm sphere around the seed voxel coordinates (xyz =  10, 3, 3), which were taken from Preuschoff et al. (2006).  Region of Interest Analysis We extracted data for all region of interest analyses using a cross-validation leave-one-out procedure: we re-estimated our main second-level analysis 16 times, always leaving out one subject. Starting at the peak voxel for the correlation signal in right insula and for the correlation prediction error in rACC we selected the nearest maximum in these cross-validation second-level analyses. Using that new peak voxel, we then extracted the data from the left-out subject and averaged across voxels within an 8 mm sphere around that peak. Binned Effect Size Plots To create the effect size plots of the parametric decision variables we ﬁrst divided the values in our parametric modulator into quartiles and estimating the average BOLD response in relation to each bin. We did this by sorting all trials into four bins according to the magnitude of the model predicted signal and deﬁned the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentile of the range. Then we created and estimated for each subject a new GLM with four new onset regressors containing the trials of each bin. The parameter estimates of these onset regressors represent the average height of the BOLD response for all trials in that bin. The data plots in Figures 2B and 3B are the average parameter estimates (across all subjects in the cross-validation analyses) converted to percent signal change. This analysis was performed using algorithms in the rfxplot toolbox for SPM (Gla¨ scher, 2009).  1150 Neuron 71, 1141–1152, September 22, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Learning Reward Correlations  Covariance/Correlation Comparison For the test whether bold activity in right insula is better explained by a linear relationship with covariance or correlation we estimated two additional GLMs on BOLD data, each with only one regressor (either model predicted covariance or the correlation coefﬁcient) using Bayesian estimation (Friston et al., 2002). This produced a log-evidence map for each model and we calculated average log evidences across all voxels within our region of interest for every subject and performed a random effects model comparison (Stephan et al., 2009). This analysis suggests that the correlation coefﬁcient can explain BOLD activity in midinsula better than covariance (Dirichlet a = 16.9 for correlation versus 1.1 for covariance; posterior probability [correlation] p = 0.94, exceedance probability ]probability that the correlation model is more likely] z1.0). Effect Size Time Course Plots To visualize the nature of the BOLD response to the correlation coefﬁcient as time course plot over the entire trial we upsampled the entire extracted bold signal to 100 ms (the effective temporal resolution of the averaged time course is higher than the TR because our stimulus presentation was jittered relative to slice acquisition), split the signal into trials and resampled such that the onset of the choice screen is at time 0 and the onset of the outcome screen at 8.5 s in every trial. We then estimated a GLM across trials for every time point in each subject independently. Lastly, we calculated group average effect sizes at each time point, and their standard errors. The graph in Figure 2C shows the time series of effect sizes throughout the trial for the regressor of interest. This method for plotting the effect size time course of a parametrically modulated regressor is also described in detail elsewhere (Behrens et al., 2008). Timing of Correlation Representations To investigate whether subjects carried out task related computations at the time of the outcome or at the time of choice, we estimated a separate GLM that was similar to the main GLM described above except for an additional parametric modulator at the time of choice for the correlation coefﬁcient, i.e., the correlation coefﬁcient modulated both the regressor at the time of the choice screen and the outcome screen. Representation of Portfolio Weights We investigated the questions if subjects might learn task-speciﬁc portfolio weights instead of the more universal correlation between outcomes by estimating a separate GLM. This was similar to the main GLM except that the parametric modulator r was replaced by the portfolio weight w and the correlation prediction error z was replaced by the signed weight prediction error (wt+1 – wt). The nonlinear relationship between r and w allows us to differentiate between representations of correlation and weights on the neural level. Representation of Outcome Coincidences To test for a neural representation of more qualitative coincidences instead of the correlation coefﬁcient with estimated another GLM, similar to the main GLM except that the parametric modulators r and z were replaced by a binary parametric modulator with a coincidence value of sign(td1)*sign(td2). Relationship between Explained Variance in Behavioral Model and BOLD Data To test for a relationship between behavior and neural model ﬁt we compared R2 (explained variance) in the behavioral model with the R2 in the fMRI GLM. An R2 value for the behavioral model was calculated for every subject by regressing trial-by-trial model predicted choice on subject’s actual choices. We calculated the R2 value for the fMRI regression as the proportion of variance in BOLD that was explained by our interest regressors in relation to the total variance (R2 = RSSreg/RSStot), where RSSreg equals the explained variance (variance of the predicted time course ypred = Xb, X = design matrix and b the regression coefﬁcient) and RSStot is the variance of the bold signal after adjusting for block and nuisance effects.  We also tested the inﬂuence of potential confounding variables on this relationship, namely the ﬁtted learning rate and the average absolute amount of weight updating per trial, by calculating partial correlations. This analysis conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant correlation between behavioral and neural ﬁt (rxy = 0.54, p = 0.04) after accounting for potential confounds. Furthermore, there was no relationship between these potential confounds and neural ﬁt (ray = 0.12, p = 0.66; rjwjy =  0.14, p = 0.63).  Psychophysiological Interaction (PPI) Analysis We performed posthoc an exploratory PPI analysis (Friston et al., 1997) to investigate changes in functional connectivity with right midinsula at the time  of outcome (when almost all task related activity was observed). The PPI term was Y 3 P, with Y being the BOLD time courses in the insula region of interest analysis and P indicating the time during the outcome screen. We then entered the seed region BOLD Y, the psychological variable P, and the PPI interaction term into a new GLM. Findings from this analysis are reported in Figure S4.

Prosocial sentiments, which include guilt, pity and embarrassment, enable us to care about others and to be concerned about our mistakes. Functional imaging studies have implicated frontopolar, ventromedial frontal and basal forebrain regions in the experience of prosocial sentiments. Patients with lesions of the frontopolar and ventromedial frontal areas were observed to behave inappropriately and less prosocially, which could be attributed to a generalized emotional blunting. Direct experimental evidence for brain regions distinctively associated with moral sentiment impairments is lacking, however. We investigated this issue in patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, a disorder in which early and selective impairments of social conduct are consistently observed. Using a novel moral sentiment task, we show that the degree of impairment of prosocial sentiments is associated with the degree of damage to frontopolar cortex and septal area, as assessed with 18-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose-Positron Emission Tomography, an established measure of neurodegenerative damage. This effect was dissociable from impairment of other-critical feelings (anger and disgust), which was in turn associated with dorsomedial prefrontal and amygdala dysfunction. Our ﬁndings suggest a critical role of the frontopolar cortex and septal region in enabling prosocial sentiments, a fundamental component of moral conscience. Published by Elsevier Inc.  Moral sentiments are vital ingredients of moral conscience (Smith, 1759/1966; Frank, 1988). Guilt, pity, and embarrassment, in particular, are known as prosocial sentiments because they induce people to seek forgiveness following misbehavior, to comfort those who suffer and to abide to social standards (Eisenberg, 2000) (see Supplementary Information). The dominant role of prosocial sentiments is vividly illustrated by Hamlet, who ponders whether it would be preferable to die (“not to be”) than to live (“to be”) with his guilty conscience after committing a murder (“to bear the whips and scorns of time”; Shakespeare's Hamlet, Act III, Sc. I).  Clinical observations suggest that damage to several brain regions, including ventral medial and polar sectors of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Eslinger and Damasio, 1985; Koenigs et al., 2007), the anterior temporal lobes (Edwards-Lee et al., 1997; Mendez, 2006; Rankin et al.,  ⁎ Corresponding author.

Published by Elsevier Inc. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.026  2006) and basal forebrain, including the septal area (Moll et al., 2005b), may lead to impairments of moral judgment and conduct. However, direct evidence for the neuroanatomical bases of prosocial sentiments in patients with brain lesions is scarce, and very few studies have employed stimulus–response tests in this context (e.g., Krajbich et al., 2009). Inferences about impaired prosocial sentiments have relied on behavioral questionnaires, caregiver ratings, and qualitative observations, which are heavily inﬂuenced by the expectations of observers and by the frequency of socially inappropriate behavior during daily activities. Most importantly, studies using caregiver ratings of prosocial sentiments have not reported whether these were impaired relatively to other feelings. Therefore, the purported prosocial impairment in such cases has been interpreted as due to a general (i.e., nonspeciﬁc) emotional blunting (Bechara et al., 2000). Naturally, impaired prosocial feelings, as compared to impaired other-critical feelings (e.g., anger, disgust), should be expected to cause severe antisocial behaviors.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in healthy participants have implicated ventral and dorsal sectors of the PFC and the temporal lobes, as well as the amygdala, anterior insula and other  1736  J. Moll et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1735–1742  subcortical regions, in interpersonal and emotional contexts associated with autonomic arousal, mental state inference, empathic responses and self-other distinction (Berthoz et al., 2006; Carr et al., 2003; Critchley et al., 2004; Decety et al., 2004; Ochsner et al., 2004; Singer et al., 2004; Lamm et al., 2007). Studies speciﬁcally addressing prosocial feelings and behaviors have implicated the medial frontopolar cortex (FPC) and subgenual cortex, as well as the superior temporal sulcus (STS) region and the ventral striatum, septal/basal forebrain area and hypothalamus. These investigations employed different study designs, including social scenarios evocative of guilt, pity and embarrassment (Berthoz et al., 2002; Moll et al., 2002, 2007; Takahashi et al., 2004; Zahn et al., 2009c), charitable donations (Harbaugh et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2008; Moll et al., 2006), and economic decisions involving regret, trust and cooperation (Coricelli et al., 2005; Krueger et al., 2007a; Rilling et al., 2002). In contrast, stimuli linked to social and object aversion, such as injustice and gore, typically evoke other-critical feelings (contempt, anger, disgust) (Haidt, 2003; Rozin et al., 1999). Other-critical feelings tend to promote interpersonal aggression and social disengagement (Moll and Schulkin, 2009), and their anatomical bases are more wellestablished; regions consistently associated with other-critical feelings include the dorsomedial (dmPFC) and lateral sectors of the PFC [especially the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the adjoining agranular insula) and the amygdala (Buckholtz et al., 2008; Decety et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2006; Moll et al., 2005a, 2007). However, because functional individuals are unsuitable to identify which brain regions are necessary for a given cognitive ability (Price et al., 1999), studies in patients with brain lesions are indispensable for establishing which brain regions are necessary for representing prosocial and other-critical sentiments.  imaging studies in normal  We investigated the neural basis of impaired prosocial and othercritical sentiments in 21 patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and 30 normal controls with a novel experimental test (the Moral Sentiment Task) and resting-state 18-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET). BvFTD is characterized by progressive frontotemporal neurodegeneration and early social impairments (Neary et al., 1998). Inappropriate social behavior and feelings in patients with bvFTD have been associated with ventral, dorsomedial frontal and anterior temporal lobe atrophy (Liu et al., 2004; Rosen et al., 2005; Snowden et al., 2001; Williams et al, 2005). BvFTD offers a unique opportunity to investigate which regions are speciﬁc for enabling prosocial sentiments due to differences in regional distribution of neuropathology. We hypothesized that the degree of impairment of prosocial feelings would be associated with the degree of damage to frontopolar, ventral frontal and basal forebrain regions, and that these effects would be at least partially dissociable from the brain networks enabling general emotional arousal or the other-critical emotions (anger/disgust). Although both prosocial and other-critical sentiments were investigated, the main focus of the present analyses was on prosocial sentiments because (1) their neuroanatomical bases have been much less explored by both functional imaging and lesion studies, and (2) reduced prosocial feelings most likely play a crucial role in explaining callous and nonempathic behaviors in brain-damaged patients.  Materials and methods  Patients and controls  Patients were referred by specialists to participate in a larger observational study at the clinical center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intramural program in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. Thirtyone consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of bvFTD were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of bvFTD was made on the basis of clinical and neuropsychological data, as well as on visual inspection of MRI and FDG-PET, following the consensus criteria of the Lund Manchester Group (Neary et al., 1998) and the Work Group on Frontotemporal Dementia and Pick's Disease (McKhann et al., 2001). Dementia severity was assessed with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2, a reliable and valid measure of global cognitive dysfunction (Kertesz et al., 2003). Normal controls were also evaluated with the Mattis scale in order to rule out cognitive impairment. Patients stayed at NIH for 1 week and were accompanied by their main caregiver (for further details on the patient cohort see Zahn et al., 2009b). They were clinically assessed by a senior neurologist and a senior neuropsychologist (J.G.) and underwent extensive neuropsychological testing as well as MRI and resting FDG-PET. General inclusion criteria were strong right-handedness and English as ﬁrst language. The leading symptoms of bvFTD were progressive behavioral abnormalities with an early loss of insight as noted by caregivers. All patients showed abnormalities within frontotemporal areas on visual inspection of FDG-PET, MRI, or both. Substance abuse was ruled out by a negative history antedating the onset of the behavioral changes and by close monitoring over the 1-week period of the study. Ten patients were excluded prior to statistical analysis due to technical problems with imaging (n=8) or MST (n=2) data. The ﬁnal bvFTD sample therefore included 15 men and 6 women (age = 60.6 ± 8.0 years; education=15.4±3.2 years). Thirty age- and education-matched volunteers (15 men) served as controls for standardization of the MST (age: 61.5±8.5 years; education: 16.9±2.6 years). FDG-PET scans were obtained from 12 controls matched in gender, age and education. All controls had a normal neurological examination and no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. Controls were compensated for participation according to NIH standards. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants according to the NINDS Institutional Review Board procedures.  Moral sentiment task  The MST (obtainable from the ﬁrst author [jorge.moll@idor.org] upon request) was designed as a self-paced computerized test programmed on Experimental Run Time System (Berisoft Cooperation, Germany, http://www.erts.de). Ninety-eight written scenarios (“stimuli”) were presented, one at a time, at the top of a screen for participants to decide which of four words at the bottom (choice options) best described the feeling they would experience in that given situation. Each stimulus was associated with a “target”, based on normative data from controls. Targets included the following classes of sentiments: guilt, pity and embarrassment (prosocial sentiments), anger and disgust (other-critical sentiments), fear, and neutral (Fig. 1). A previous study on moral sentiments showed these stimuli to be powerful elicitors of experienced moral sentiments (Moll et al., 2007). Non-target feelings belonged to the same list of targets. All items were presented in ﬁxed randomized order (14 stimuli for each sentiment plus 14 neutral stimuli). Colors and positions were counterbalanced across the different sentiments. A NEUTRAL tag was present in each trial as one of the four options. Instructions for the MST are provided in the Supplementary Methods.  The accuracy of each stimulus category was assessed with an index score which penalized scores for a given category in case of omission or commission “errors” (these errors are statistical deviations from the healthy control group norm, being otherwise compatible with a patient's subjective experience). To that aim, we ﬁrst computed the number of correct choices for a given category (e.g., number of times “GUILT” was assigned to a scenario that is known to be consistently associated with guilt in controls) and then weighted this result by the inverse of the number of times that same option was assigned to a wrong category (e.g., number of times GUILT was erroneously associated with a scenario belonging to a different class) plus one (to avoid division by zero). For example, if a participant chose GUILT appropriately in 12 out of the 14 guilt scenarios, and mistakenly chose GUILT instead of the correct target in two other scenario categories, her  J.

Participants viewed 98 social scenarios on the screen, together with response options: the target (correct choice, based on normative data) and three non-targets (“distracters”). They were told to report what they would feel in each given situation. A ﬁxed color coding of keyboard keys and response options helped to minimize task-related visuomotor load. The position of the target word option was randomized across trials. The neutral option (with equal frequency as the other options) was present in all trials. Any given word could be the target on each trial with equal probability. The scenario examples do not include samples from all experimental conditions.  score would be 12/(2+1)=4. These raw scores were z-normalized for the whole sample (21 bvFTD patients and 30 controls). The normalized scores for guilt, pity and embarrassment were averaged to generate a composite prosocial sentiment score for each subject. Normalized scores for anger and disgust were averaged to generate a composite other-critical score for each subject. This was done to increase the power of the measures, based on psychological and functional imaging evidence that prosocial and other-critical sentiments rely on partially separate neural networks, which are nonetheless consistent among feelings belonging to each of these categories (Moll et al., 2007). Fear was left out of the analyses because (1) fearful stimuli in our task did not invoke social fear, (2) current theoretical models of other-critical emotions include anger and disgust (Haidt, 2003; Rozin et al., 1999), and (3) we had previous evidence from social script studies linking the neural representations of anger and disgust, but not fear (Moll et al., 2005a,b, 2007). Mean number of words and characters per statement were equivalent for the prosocial and other-critical categories (respectively: mean word t = −0.14, p = 0.89; mean character count = 20.0 vs. 20.1, count= 83.9 vs. 84.8, t=−1.01, p =0.31). Mean correct category assignment of social scenarios by controls (0.89±0.12) was similar to our previous study on normal controls (Moll et al., 2007). Controls scored the prosocial and other-critical categories with comparable accuracy, indicating that these categories were matched in difﬁculty (t=0.36, p =0.74).  Behavioral data analysis  Neuropsychological data were analyzed with SPSS v. 16 (www. spss.com) and R v. 2.8.0 (www.r-project.org). The z-normalized scores on prosocial and other-critical sentiments from patients and controls were assessed by Welch t-tests, with the alpha level set to p = 0.05. All variables were assessed for multicollinearity (see Supplementary Methods). Two-tailed signiﬁcances were adopted for all analyses. Clinical and behavioral symptoms were assessed with standard instruments (for further details, see Zahn et al., 2009b).  Image acquisition and analysis  Image acquisition  Structural MR imaging was performed on a General Electric 1.5 Tesla scanner (3D-T1-SPGR sequence, 120 contiguous slices, slice thickness=1.5 mm, in-plane resolution=0.9375 mm×0.9375 mm, ﬂip angle=20°). All FDG-PET scans were acquired with a GE Advance PET Scanner. Subjects were fasting since midnight before the scan and had no caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine for 24 h before the scan. An arterial line was inserted for arterial blood sampling. The subjects were given an intravenous injection of 5 millicuries of FDG while they wore eye patches and ear plugs. Starting with the time of injection and continuing through the cerebral uptake period and subsequent scan, 25 arterial blood specimens were taken at ﬁxed intervals for assay of plasma radioactivity and glucose content. A transmission scan was used to correct the emission data. At the end of the 45-min uptake period, the emission PET scan was performed (15 min for one set of 35 brain slices).  Imaging analysis  Imaging data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5, http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5). The following pre-processing steps were applied: normalization with 2×2× 2 mm (8 mm3) voxel size and smoothing (FWHM=12 mm). Normalization was performed by ﬁrst normalizing the 3D MRI using the SPM5 T1- template and then applying the same transformation to the FDG-PET images. Global normalization was performed using cerebellar metabolism as a scaling factor. Three statistical models were used to assess inter-group and intra-group PET metabolism differences. In the ﬁrst model, bvFTD and controls were entered as categorical variables and t-tests were used to compare the regional metabolism between groups (voxel-level signiﬁcance threshold: p b0.001, uncorrected). This statistical map was used as an inclusive mask for the subsequent parametric analysis, to minimize the number of comparisons over the whole brain. The second model (parametric) employed multiple regression (SPM5 design matrix) to probe the association between regional cerebral metabolism in bvFTD with  1738  J. Moll et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1735–1742  (i) prosocial scores (adjusting for other-critical and dementia severity scores) and (ii) other-critical scores (adjusting for prosocial and dementia severity scores). The relationship between metabolism and the combined (additive) effects of prosocial and other-critical scores was also investigated (see Supplementary Results). An additional analysis explored the correlations between FPC and septal metabolism with guilt, pity and embarrassment separately, controlling for dementia severity.  We report only areas surviving a family-wise error (FWE) corrected threshold of p=0.05 either across the whole brain or across the following regions of interest deﬁned a priori on the basis of coordinates from previous studies and used as the center of spheres (see Supplementary Methods for details on the regions of interest). For the purpose of visual displays only, a threshold of p=0.05, uncorrected, and a cluster threshold=20 voxels was employed.  Anatomical localization  Localization was performed using anatomical landmarks and by looking at activations in the Montreal Neurological Imaging (MNI) space projected onto a standard MNI template. Talairach transformed coordinates using Brett's formula (http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/ Imaging /common/mnispace.shtml) were used to identify corresponding Brodmann areas (BA) using the Talairach Daemon software version 2 (http://ric.uthscsa.edu/projects/ talairachdaemon.html). All coordinates are in Montreal Neurological Institute Standard Space. MRIcron (http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricron/) was used to display statistical masks overlaid on a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI template (Rorden and Brett, 2000).  Results  Behavioral results  As expected, bvFTD patients showed pronouncedly reduced prosocial sentiment scores as compared with controls (mean± standard deviation (SD): −0.76 ± 0.82 vs. 0.52 ± 0.49, t = 6.4, p b0.000001; Fig. 2a). Patients also showed reduced other-critical scores (combined anger and disgust scores) compared with controls (−0.54±0.61 vs. 0.47±0.71, t=5.4, p b0.00001; Fig. 2b). These results indicate that, as a group, patients were markedly impaired both on prosocial and other-critical sentiments.  lism) would be parametrically associated with impaired performance on the MST within the bvFTD group. For this purpose, a multiple regression design was ﬁrst employed within the patient group to explore the effects of regional hypometabolism on prosocial sentiment impairment, controlling for other-critical scores and dementia severity. Lower scores on prosocial sentiments were associated with hypometabolism in the medial FPC [Brodmann's area (BA) 10], mainly in the right hemisphere, and in the septal area (Fig. 3a, b and Table 1), supporting the prediction that these regions are necessary and selective for prosocial sentiments.  One related issue is whether the above brain regions are equally important for guilt, pity and embarrassment, as emphasized by recent fMRI studies (Moll et al., 2007). As a further differentiation of the PFC, the FPC performs an important role in the prospective assessments and valuation of social choices (Christoff and Gabrieli, 2000; Moll et al., 2007), key abilities for the successful engagement of prosocial behaviors (Moll et al., 2006). The septal area, in turn, is believed to be involved in social attachment and empathic concern for others (Insel and Young, 2001; Moll et al., 2006), which are important for feelings of guilt and pity, but not for embarrassment, a prosocial sentiment that it is associated with concerns about one's own self-image related to violations of social conventions (Einsenberg, 2000). This aspect was investigated by computing the correlations between FPC and septal metabolism with guilt, pity and embarrassment separately, controlling for dementia severity. Individual scores on each of these three sentiments were signiﬁcantly correlated with the degree of FPC hypometabolism. Hypometabolism in the septal area was signiﬁcantly correlated with impaired guilt and pity, but not with embarrassment (Fig. 3c).  Next, the relationship between brain hypometabolism and othercritical sentiments were explored with multiple regression, entering prosocial scores and dementia severity as control variables. Lower other-critical scores were associated with reduced metabolism in two predicted frontal and limbic regions, the dmPFC (mainly in the right hemisphere; BA 8/9; p = 0.016, FWE-corrected) and the right amygdala (p =0.022, FWE-corrected) (Fig. 4, Table 1). Hypometabolism in the lateral OFC / anterior insula correlated both with othercritical and prosocial scores (Supplementary Fig. 2). These effects support the notion that the dmPFC and amygdala play an important role in social aversion (Buckholtz et al., 2008; Decety et al., 2004; Moll et al., 2005a; Sanfey et al., 2003).  Neuroimaging results  Discussion  Patients showed the expected frontotemporal and subcortical hypometabolism in comparison to controls (see supplementary information). However, our main analyses aimed at exploring whether regional brain dysfunction (FDG-PET regional hypometabo The main ﬁnding of this investigation was that the resting PET hypometabolism, a sensitive marker of neurodegeneration (Kanda et al., 2008), in the medial FPC and in the septal area was associated with the level of prosocial sentiment impairment in patients with  Fig. 2.

These scatter plots are for the purpose of display only, and were not the basis of any inferences in this study.

Septal metabolism was signiﬁcantly correlated with guilt (r=0.46, p =0.039) and pity (r=0.50, p =0.025), but not with embarrassment (r=0.26, p=0.26).  bvFTD. The speciﬁc role of the FPC and septal area in this regard was further corroborated by the ﬁnding that decreased other-critical scores resulted from hypometabolism in distinct PFC and subcortical regions, namely the dmPFC and the right amygdala.

Prosocial effects were evaluated by entering prosocial scores as the variable of interest, and othercritical and dementia scores as covariates. Other-critical effects were evaluated by entering other-critical scores as the variable of interest, and prosocial and dementia scores as covariates. Results of FWE-correction over a priori regions of interest deﬁned on the basis of previous studies are reported (see Materials and methods).  The role of the frontopolar cortex in prosocial sentiments  The role of FPC in social cognition has received growing attention (Christoff and Gabrieli, 2000; Heekeren et al., 2003; Greene et al., 2004; Wood and Grafman, 2003; Krueger et al., 2007b; Young et al., 2007). Remarkably, virtually all fMRI studies addressing neural responses to moral judgments (Moll et al., 2005b) and to social scenarios evocative of guilt, pity and embarrassment (Moll et al., 2007; Zahn et al., 2009c) found medial FPC activation. Furthermore, the FPC has been implicated in decisions involving costly punishment (de Quervain et al., 2004) and donation (Moll et al., 2006), as well as in inferring the emotional states of others (Amodio and Frith, 2006). Although the FPC is often affected in cases of vmPFC damage (Eslinger and Damasio, 1985; Koenigs and Tranel, 2007), few lesion studies investigated its role in the genesis of social and emotional impairments (Hornak et al., 2003; Moll and de Oliveira-Souza, 2007). A recent study on a similar patient group indicated reduced behavioral responses to embarrassment, but not to startle (Sturm et al., 2006). In addition, another recent study engaged six patients with vmPFC lesions in different economic decision tasks (dictator, ultimatum and trust games) and demonstrated that, relative to control subjects, they donated less, were less trustworthy and relatively insensitive to guilt  1740  J. Moll et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1735–1742  Fig. 4. (a) Areas of PET hypometabolism associated with reduced other-critical sentiments (adjusted for dementia severity and prosocial sentiments). The right amygdala and the dmPFC were the only regions surviving FWE-corrected p =0.05 over the whole-brain or a priori ROIs. Statistical maps are overlaid onto an anatomical template, with display threshold of uncorrected p b0.05, k≥20 voxels for visualization purposes. (b) Linear regression plots (not adjusted for dementia severity and prosocial sentiments) of regional PET metabolism and other-critical scores for the dmPFC (r=0.54, p=0.011) and right amygdala (r =0.50, p=0.022). These scatter plots are for the purpose of display only, and were not the basis of any inferences in this study.  (Krajbich et al., 2009). It should be emphasized that PFC lesions in Krajbich et al.'s study ranged from the vmPFC proper to the medial FPC in virtually all cases, as judged by visual inspection of the lesion overlap maps. Our study thus helps establish the FPC as an important neural component for enabling prosocial sentiments, including guilt, pity and embarrassment, and extends previous ﬁndings by improving anatomical localization of these effects within the PFC.  Social afﬁliation and the septal area  In addition to the FPC, we found a decrease in septal hypometabolism with increasing impairments on prosocial sentiments. Anatomically, the septal region contains the septum pellucidum, composed of thin layers of ﬁbrous tissue and slender fascicles, and the septum verum, a collection of eleven small nuclei located anteriorly and inferiorly to the septum pellucidum (Andy and Stephan, 1968). Contrary to the notion that limbic structures are evolutionarily ancient or vestigial in humans (MacLean, 1973), the septal nuclei may actually have increased in size and complexity during hominin phylogenesis (Andy and Stephan, 1968; Joseph, 1996). The role of the septal area in social behavior is highlighted by the fact that septal damage can produce drastic behavioral abnormalities, leading to predatory aggression and changes in sexual behavior in humans and animals (Gorman and Cummings, 1992). Stimulation of this region, in contrast, induces pleasurable experiences and decreases intraspecies aggression (Bishop et al., 1963; Irvin et al., 1990). Some researchers have proposed that septal dysfunction may underlie the lack of empathy, guilt and remorse that is typically observed in psychopathy (Gorenstein and Newman, 1980). The septal region and adjacent subgenual cingulate, preoptic and ventromedial hypothalamic areas are the main binding sites for oxytocin and vasopressin, which play central roles in social bonding (Insel and Young, 2001). Functional imaging studies looking at mother-offspring and romantic attachment, charitable donations and economic cooperation based on trust (Bartels and Zeki, 2004; Harbaugh et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2008; Krueger et al., 2007a,b; Moll et al., 2006; Mobbs et al., 2009) found activation in the septal region. The putative role of the septal area in enabling prosocial sentiments has so far remained under-recognized, however. Our ﬁnding that septal hypometabolism is associated with reduced guilt and pity supports a mutual role of the septal area and the FPC in prosocial behaviors, including empathic concern, altruism and related afﬁliative inclinations.  Previous fMRI studies implicate additional brain regions in prosocial sentiments, especially the subgenual cortex (Hsu et al., 2008; Moll et al., 2006; Zahn et al., 2009c). Our prediction that  subgenual neurodegeneration would be associated with prosocial sentiment impairment was not conﬁrmed, however. It is possible that the subgenual cortex plays a more elaborated role in prosocial sentiments, a notion supported by the role of the subgenual cortex in the pathophysiology of major depression (Drevets et al., 1998), decisions involving altruistic donations (Moll et al., 2006) and coding for individual differences in guilt-proneness and empathic concern (Zahn et al., 2009a).  Brain regions mediating other-critical feelings  In contrast to our ﬁndings regarding prosocial sentiments, hypometabolism in the right amygdala and dmPFC was associated with reduced other-critical scores. The amygdala, dmPFC (and neighboring paracingulate cortex) and lateral OFC / adjoining agranular anterior insula have been consistently implicated in imaging studies on the mechanisms of social punishment, social response reversal, racial bias, and competition (Decety et al., 2004; Kringelbach and Rolls, 2003; Lieberman et al., 2003; Moll et al., 2005a; Sanfey et al., 2003; Singer et al., 2006). A shared feature of these conditions is that they all involve some kind of external aversive signaling, inducing an agent to act upon the behavior of another agent or object (e.g., through punishment). Our data show that the right amygdala and dmPFC are necessary for appropriate other-critical sentiments.  While the role of the amygdala in other-critical sentiments is supported by several studies on social disapproval, prejudice and lack of trust (Calder et al., 2001; Lieberman et al., 2003; Sanfey et al., 2003), the theoretical basis for the association of dmPFC hypometabolism with impaired other-critical feelings is uncertain. fMRI studies found activity in this region in response to social feedback and when evaluating others, mainly when “others” are categorized as members of an out-group or dissimilar (Mitchell et al., 2006; Schiller et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2009). A recent fMRI study using scenarios similar to the ones herein employed showed a remarkable agreement with our ﬁndings: whereas the dmPFC showed increased responses to “other-anger,” the more anterior FPC responded more strongly to guilt and compassion or pity (Kédia et al., 2008). Nonetheless, lesion studies investigating the impact of dmPFC damage on moral cognition and emotion are lacking. One interesting possibility is whether othercritical sentiments could be reduced by modulating dmPFC activity, a ﬁnding that could have potential therapeutic implications for managing aggressive and antisocial behaviors.  A notable exception for the brain regions predicted to be selectively associated with other-critical scores was the lateral OFC / anterior insula.  J. Moll et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1735–1742  1741  Instead, we found that hypometabolism in this region was strongly but similarly associated with other-critical and with prosocial impairments. One possible explanation is that the lateral OFC / anterior insula are involved with more general aspects of behavioral reinforcement, response reversal and unpleasantness in social contexts, such as when observing other's pain (Decety et al., 2004; Kringelbach and Rolls, 2003; Lamm et al., 2007; Singer et al., 2006), which might be important not only for other-critical feelings but also for certain aspects of prosocial sentiments (e.g., restraining from an action that could evoke feelings of guilt or embarrassment).  Emotional dysfunction and PFC-subcortical damage  Our results did not support the alternative hypothesis that the association between FPC-septal hypometabolism and reduced prosocial sentiments emerged from an overall emotional blunting in bvFTD because this association remained robust after controlling for othercritical ratings. This is in keeping with the hypothesized role of speciﬁc PFC and subcortical sub-regions in enabling prosocial sentiments (Moll and de Oliveira-Souza, 2007). Studies on patients with rostral ventromedial lesions, which often encompass the FPC, speak for a complex interplay of emotional impairments: while these patients have an increased preference for “utilitarian” choices in moral dilemmas (Koenigs et al., 2007), indicating reduced emotionality, they show increased costly punishment of non-cooperators in an economic game (Koenigs and Tranel, 2007), suggestive of heightened emotionality. On a more cautionary note, although the observed relationships between impairments of feelings and localized metabolic dysfunction go a step beyond fMRI evidence by implying possible causal effects, these associations are still correlational in nature and future prospective studies are needed to further support causal inferences. Taken together, these results support a functional subspecialization of PFC-subcortical regions in enabling distinct aspects of prosocial and other-critical subjective emotional states and behavioral inclinations.  Conclusions  The FPC and the septal area are necessary for prosocial sentiments. These effects are likely selective because other-critical impairments seem to be associated with a distinct pattern of regional dysfunction affecting the dmPFC and the right amygdala. These ﬁndings are in line with the role of prosocial sentiments as the affective hub of moral conscience, given the prominence of their association with the FPC and the septal area—brain regions that have shown both allometric and non-allometric increases in humans (Stephan, 1983).

A recent meta-analysis across 40 fMRI studies revealed that affective empathy is most often associated with increased activity in the insula, whereas cognitive empathy is most often associated with activity in the midcingulate cortex and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (MCC/dmPFC). To date, however, it remains unclear whether individual differences in brain morphometry in these regions underlie different dispositions in affective and cognitive empathy. In order to test this hypothesis, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to examine the extent to which gray matter density predicts scores from an established empathy measure (Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy; QCAE). One hundred and seventy-six participants completed the QCAE and underwent MRI in order to acquire a high-resolution, three-dimensional T1-weighted structural scans. A factor analysis of the questionnaire scores revealed two distinct factors of empathy, affective and cognitive, which conﬁrmed the validity of the QCAE. VBM results revealed gray matter density differences associated with the distinct components of empathy. Higher scores on affective empathy were associated with greater gray matter density in the insula cortex and higher scores of cognitive empathy were associated with greater gray matter density in the MCC/dmPFC. Taken together, these results provide validation for empathy being a multi-component construct, suggesting that affective and cognitive empathy are differentially represented in brain morphometry as well as providing convergent evidence for empathy being represented by different neural and structural correlates.  © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  To successfully navigate our social environment it is integral to understand and experience the emotional states of others, a process typically referred to as empathy. Empathy involves an affective component, subjective experiences of the emotions of others, and a cognitive component, the ability to understand others' motivation (Bernhardt and Singer, 2012; Decety, 2011; Shamay-Tsoory, 2011). The aim of this study is to investigate whether individual differences in affective and cognitive empathy are subserved by differences in brain anatomy. When considering the affective component of empathy, emphasis is typically placed on experiencing the emotional states of others consciously, which implies a self-other distinction, as well as an understanding of where the emotional experience originates from (Bernhardt and Singer, 2012; Decety and Jackson, 2004). Affective empathy is different from emotion contagion (the automatic adoption of another person's  ⁎ Corresponding author at: School of Psychology, Building 17, Monash University,  Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia.

Molenberghs).  emotions; Hatﬁeld et al., 2009) and mimicry (the synchronisation of emotional expressions and behaviours; Preston and De Waal, 2002) which act as automatic responses to another person's emotional state but not necessarily self-other distinction. Affective empathy is also differentiated from sympathy or empathic concern, as the latter represents an internal state of emotion and motivation driven by the concern for another person's welfare but not necessarily a sharing of emotions (Bernhardt and Singer, 2012; Decety and Chaminade, 2003; Decety and Cowell, 2014; Singer and Lamm, 2009). Note that we do not argue that these processes (for example empathic concern) are unrelated to affective empathy, but rather that affective empathy can be thought of as an umbrella term that encompasses multiple dimensions.  Initial neuroimaging studies on affective sharing suggested that the, emotional components are shared vicariously but not the sensory components (Jackson et al., 2006; Singer et al., 2004). For example, when experiencing pain ﬁrst-hand, activity in the somatosensory cortex occurs as a response to the sensory stimulation received, whereas the insula and anterior cingulate cortex activate for the affective components of pain (Morrison et al., 2004; Singer et al., 2004). In contrast, when we observed another person in pain, initial ﬁndings suggested  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.038 1053-8119/© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  306  R. Eres et al. / NeuroImage 117 (2015) 305–310  that only the affective components are vicariously experienced through activation of the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (Jackson et al., 2006; Singer et al., 2004; Lamm et al., 2011). More recent evidence suggests that somatosensory cortex may also be activated in response to perceiving another person in pain (Avenanti et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2012; Fox et al., 2013; Marsh et al., 2013).  The degree of overlap between ﬁrst-hand and second-hand emotional experience for the affective components is controversial (Decety, 2010, 2011). For example, the anterior insula appears to activate more so with vicarious experiences of pain (Jackson et al., 2006), whilst for ﬁrst-hand experiences of pain the posterior insula is implemented (Decety and Lamm, 2006). The insula also responds to affective sharing outside empathic pain. Speciﬁcally, greater activation in the anterior insula occurs when observing videos of people with disgusted faces (Wicker et al., 2003) as well as when vicariously observing others experience unpleasant food (Jabbi et al., 2007), and in response to positive emotions such as pleasure (Small et al., 2001). Menon and Uddin (2010) identify the insula as a fundamental brain region involved in integrating visceral and autonomic information with salient stimuli, which provides infrastructure for the representation of subjective bodily feelings of positive and negative emotions. This representation ultimately intensiﬁes our emotional awareness. It should be noted that here we have focused primarily on the insula for processing vicarious emotions, however there is ample evidence to suggest that some emotions are vicariously processed in different regions; for example, fear in the amygdala (Askew and Field, 2007; Olsson and Phelps, 2007; Phelps, 2006).  The cognitive component of empathy relies heavily on attributing emotional states onto others and may partially call on mechanisms underlying Theory of Mind (ToM; Decety, 2011). The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) are the two most common regions associated with theory of mind (Van Overwalle, 2009; Schurz et al., 2014). Considering the dorsal regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, there are a range of behaviours related to cognitive empathy that are recruited. A link to the dmPFC has been found for triadic relationships between two separate agents and a goal (Saxe, 2006), perspective taking (D'Argembeau et al., 2007) and direct and reﬂected self-knowledge (Ochsner et al., 2005). The TPJ on the other hand plays a role in several lower-level computational processes associated with a self-other differentiation and reorienting attention to salient stimuli, and as such plays a crucial role in higher-level cognitive process such as theory of mind and cognitive empathy (Decety and Lamm, 2007). There is also evidence to suggest that the TPJ can be broken into three separate sections, each interacting structurally and functionally with known areas of social cognition and attention (Mars et al., 2012).  However, neuroimaging and psychological research show that ToM and cognitive empathy are also distinct. Theory of mind involves taking on the perspective of another person and attributing to them particular cognitive states; whilst cognitive empathy is more involved in attributing emotional states (Reniers et al., 2011). That said, Perry and Shamay-Tsoory (2013) deconstruct cognitive empathy further by suggesting that it comprises higher order cognitive processes typically involved in ToM, including affective and cognitive mentalising. The former surrounds beliefs about the emotional state of another, whilst the latter concerns beliefs about the beliefs of another person. Though both mentalising processes are involved in cognitive empathy, Perry and Shamay-Tsoory (2013) suggest that affective mentalising may sustain a prioritised role in understanding and sharing the mental states of others. Völlm et al. (2006) investigated the overlap between neural correlates associated with cognitive empathy and theory of mind tasks using fMRI. The authors presented participants with static images that depicted a story but manipulated whether the story recruited theory of mind or cognitive empathy mechanisms. Both tasks involved the dmPFC and TPJ but the empathy condition also showed unique activation along the cingulate cortex.  Functional MRI evidence strongly suggests that there are differences in the neural activity associated with the different sub-components of empathy. However, fMRI methods cannot identify whether these differences are subserved by individual changes in brain anatomy. To test whether volumetric differences in brain anatomy predict a functional difference in empathic expression presupposes a relationship between blood oxygen level dependence (BOLD) responses and anatomy. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that this may be the case. For example, fMRI studies have shown greater BOLD activity in the hippocampus when completing tasks involving spatial navigation and the use of mental maps (e.g., Astur et al., 2005; Rosenbaum et al., 2004). Greater gray matter density in the hippocampus has also been found in London taxi drivers who frequently draw upon the hippocampus to navigate (Maguire et al., 2000). This suggests that functional activation, structural gray matter density, and behaviour might be related.  Previous investigations looking at brain structure and its relationship with empathy have identiﬁed differences in several regions. Banissy et al. (2012) used VBM to infer a relationship between each of the sub-scales of the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI; Davis, 1980) and local gray matter density (local grey matter density here refers to the distribution of gray matter within each voxel to be compared across participants; Ashburner and Friston, 2000). They showed negative associations between gray matter density and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the empathic concern sub-scale, a sub-scale aimed at tapping into affective empathy. A second sub-scale tapping into affective empathy, the personal distress sub-scale, was positively associated with gray matter density in left insula. In addition, the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were positively associated with scores on the cognitive empathy measure. In a different VBM investigation, Mutschler et al. (2013) similarly showed greater gray matter density in the left anterior insula to be associated with scores of affective empathy when using the Empathy Scale (E-Scale).  In a recent meta-analysis of 40 functional MRI studies, Fan et al. (2011) investigated the consistency of brain regions involved in affective and cognitive empathy, as well as the functional role they may play using a more comprehensive analysis. Multi-kernel density analysis (MKDA) was used to measure the peak coordinates in each statistical contrast map from each of the cognitive and affective empathy studies used in their meta-analysis. Fan et al. (2011) showed that the affective component of empathy was more associated with insula activity, whereas the cognitive component of empathy was more associated with the midcingulate cortex and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (MCC/ dmPFC). This highlights a consistent neural substrate for each component of empathy.  In light of this, we aimed to identify whether the different components of empathy are associated with gray matter differences. We aim to provide convergent evidence for the reliability and validity of previous VBM outcomes by conceptually replicating previous studies to show that individual differences in empathic ability are subserved by differences in gray matter density when using alternate methodologies. Conceptual replication is an important tool in psychological sciences as it helps determine the true effect between particular constructs. There are two methods commonly used to measure differences in gray matter across participants. The ﬁrst, cortical thickness, measures a one-dimension scalar of cortical thickness at each voxel (surface analysis), whilst the other, voxel-based morphometry (volumetric analysis), measures the amount of tissue within each voxel (Hutton et al., 2009). In line with previous studies that associated individual differences in empathy with gray matter density (Banissy et al., 2012; Mutschler et al., 2013), and in order to replicate their ﬁndings, we also opted for the VBM method.  Considering our aims, peak MNI coordinates for affective (i.e., insula) and cognitive (i.e., MCC/dmPFC) empathy were used as regions of interest based on the ﬁndings from Fan et al. (2011). We used scores on the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE; Reniers et al., 2011) as regressors for the VBM analysis. The QCAE is  R. Eres et al. / NeuroImage 117 (2015) 305–310  307  well established in terms of concurrent, ecological and construct validity as well as being a highly reliable measure of affective and cognitive empathy. For example, scores on the QCAE are associated highly (r = .62, p b .001 for the affective components and r = .76, p b .001 for the cognitive components) with scores on the basic empathy scale (BES; Jolliffe and Farrington, 2006). Internal consistencies have been shown to be of a high standard with Cronbach's alpha values up to .85 (Reniers et al., 2011). We hypothesised, that if empathy is subserved by gray matter differences, participants with higher scores on affective empathy will have greater gray matter density in the insula whilst participants who score higher on cognitive empathy will have greater gray matter density in the MCC/ dmPFC. To test this hypothesis, we used voxel based morphometry (VBM) to investigate local gray matter density associated with scores on the QCAE measure.  Method  Participants  One hundred and seventy-six participants (females = 88, Mage = 22.07, SDage = 4.82 years) completed the QCAE and a structural MRI scan. Participants were undergraduate psychology students recruited for a range of social neuroscience projects. All participants had no history of neurological illness or injury and provided full written informed consent. The current study was approved by the local Ethics Committee from the University of Queensland.  Questionnaire for Cognitive and Affective Empathy  The Questionnaire for Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE; Reniers et al., 2011) was used to assess participants' level of cognitive and affective empathy. Within this measure are ﬁve subcomponents that constitute the two overarching factors of cognitive empathy and affective empathy. The ﬁrst affective subcomponent, emotion contagion, involves items surrounding the automaticity of mirroring others' emotional states whilst the second, proximal responsivity, measures the responsiveness of affective situations in close social context. Finally, peripheral responsivity, involves measuring the responsiveness to affective situations that occur in a more detached context.  In relation to the cognitive factor, the subcomponent perspective taking involves intuitively placing oneself in the shoes of others whereas the online simulation component is a more effortful process of attempting to understand the emotional state of others by imagining how they feel. Each item was measured on a four point Likert Scale with the options comprising Strongly Agree, Slightly Agree, Slightly Disagree, and Strongly Disagree. An example item used to assess cognitive empathy included, “Before criticising somebody, I try to imagine how I would feel if I was in their place” and for assessing affective empathy, an example item was “I usually stay emotionally detached when watching a ﬁlm” (R).  Total scores were calculated for the affective component by aggregating the scores for each of the three subscales; emotion contagion, proximal responsivity and peripheral responsivity. Total scores were similarly created for cognitive component by summating the scores on the online simulation and perspective taking subscales. Higher scores on each component of the QCAE are associated with greater cognitive and affective empathy.  Structural scan acquisition  All structural images were obtained with a 3T Siemens MRI scanner. Images provided were high-density T1 images (TR = 1900, TE = 2.32, FA = 9°, 192 cubic matrix, voxel size = 0.9 cubic mm, slice thickness = 0.9 mm) which were used in a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, comparing the gray matter density across participants.  Voxel-based morphometry  Imaging Neuroscience,  The VBM analysis conducted in the current study followed the procedures described in the VBM tutorial provided by Ashburner (2010). MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) was used in conjunction with statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Institute of Neurology, London) to segment the images into gray matter, white matter and cerebral spinal ﬂuid. To create a coregistered template from the gray matter images across participants, we used a diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie (DARTEL) algorithm (Ashburner, 2007). Absolute threshold masking was used at a threshold of 0.2 to help accommodate the proportional scaling corrections made; in addition to this we also used an explicit whole brain mask (O'Connor, 2010) to ensure that clusters did not extend into the background and increase unwanted noise. Image modulation was conducted through the preserve amount function which creates ﬂow ﬁelds that parameterise deformations automatically through the DARTEL algorithm. We then transformed this DARTEL template into MNI stereotactic space using non-linear spatial normalisation and then smoothed the images with a Gaussian Kernel (full-width at half-maximum, FWHM) of 10 mm.  Once the data had been pre-processed we entered the pre-processed gray matter images into a regression model using SPM8 to measure correlations between cortical regions and scores on the cognitive and affective components of the QCAE. To regress any extraneous effects of age and gender we entered these variables as covariates of no interest into the regression model.  A regions of  interest (ROI) approach was used based on coordinates provided by a recent meta-analysis (Fan et al., 2011) which showed that the insula was most often associated with affective empathy (left insula; x = − 42, y = 18, z = 0 and right insula; x = 38, y = 24, z = − 2) and the MCC/dmPFC most often with cognitive empathy (x = −2, y = 24, z = 38). Speciﬁcally, we created a 10 mm sphere around these coordinates using the WFU Pickatlas (Maldjian et al., 2003). Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using an FWE value of p b .05 corrected for the size of the ROIs. Outside these pre-deﬁned regions, we used a FWE value of p b .05 corrected for the whole-brain volume.  Results  QCAE  Conﬁrmatory factor analysis was used to assess the reliability and validity of the QCAE measure. Varimax rotations were used along with Kaiser Normalisation and eigenvalues above one were accepted. This analysis revealed two factors: cognitive empathy which contained two items: perspective taking and online simulation; and affective empathy which contained three items: emotion contagion, proximal responsivity and peripheral responsivity. Both factors contained high and clean factor loadings (Table 1). In total, the factor analysis accounted for 67.1% of the total variance.

Eres et al. / NeuroImage 117 (2015) 305–310  Voxel-based morphometry analysis  Higher scores on the affective empathy scale were associated with signiﬁcantly larger gray matter density in left (r = .27; −42, 11, 6; Z = 3.12; extent = 609; p corrected = .035) and right (r = .23; 39, 24, 7; Z = 3.24; extent = 163; p corrected = .021) insula (Fig. 1). Additionally, higher scores on the cognitive scale were associated with signiﬁcantly larger gray matter density in the MCC/dmPFC (r = .16; −12, 24, 37; Z = 2.99; extent = 609; p corrected = .043; Fig. 2). Whole brain analyses with the affective and cognitive scores yielded no additional signiﬁcant regions.  Discussion  Our ﬁndings show that individual differences in cognitive and affective empathy scores are associated with differences in MCC/dmPFC and insula gray matter, respectively. The insula has been implicated as an emotion processing hub involved in simulating the affective components of the emotions we observe in others (Carr et al., 2003; Danziger et al., 2009; Singer et al., 2004). Menon and Uddin (2010) suggest that emotional awareness occurs because the insula creates a representation of positive and negative emotions by integrating salient environmental stimulation with autonomic and visceral bodily sensations. This is further supported by Wiech et al. (2010) who suggest that the role of the anterior insula in the saliency network is to process the importance of an impending stimulation and integrate this into a decision-making model.  Previously we highlighted that affective empathy can be differentiated from empathic concern. However, previous evidence has suggested that increased activation in the anterior nsula and adjacent nferior frontal gyrus (AI/IFG) is associated with greater empathic concern when measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Singer et al., 2004; Sessa et al., 2013) and empathy quotient (EQ; Chakrabarti et al., 2006). Further, evidence also shows that lesions to this area are associated with lower scores on the empathic concern measure (Shamay-Tsoory  et al., 2004, 2009). Together with the ﬁndings from the current investigation, which showed affective empathy to be associated with the anterior insula, it can be suggested that empathic concern and affective empathy are subserved by similar regions which feasibly suggests that empathic concern and affective empathy may be related.  Functional MRI has been used to elucidate the mechanistic role of the insula in affective empathy, however to establish whether any brain region is necessary for behaviour we need to determine whether a reduction in this behaviour occurs subsequent a lesion. For example, Gu et al. (2012) showed that participants with an anterior insula lesion perceived painful stimulation to others slower than when perceiving people not experiencing pain which is antithetic with theoretical underpinnings suggesting pain stimuli are processed faster. Further, ShamayTsoory et al. (2009) showed that individuals with lesions in the medial prefrontal cortex extending into the cingulate cortex had more problems with cognitive empathy, whilst patients with damage to the inferior frontal gyrus and adjacent insula had more problems with affective empathy.  Voxel based morphometry studies can also show how brain structure relates to empathy. The current investigation is in line with a VBM study by Banissy et al. (2012) who also illustrated that higher scores on the affective empathy subscales (for example the personal distress subscale) of the IRI were associated with greater gray matter density in the insula. Mutschler et al. (2013) conducted a similar study with the empathy scale and found a similar positive association between affective empathy and the insula. Parkinson and Wheatley (2014), using diffusion tensor imaging, also showed that fractional anisotropy measures in communicative white matter tracts are also related with individual differences in empathy scores.  We have shown consistent ﬁndings with previous work using empathy measures and voxel-based morphometry. The current study, however, used a novel measure to elucidate the generalisability and reliability of previous work. Recently, structural brain–behaviour studies have come under scrutiny with regards to non-replicability; as such we used the QCAE as regressors in the VBM analysis in attempt  Fig. 1.

Conceptual replication, in this circumstance, is critical as it aids in identifying whether structural differences in anatomy truly underlie differences in the subcomponents of empathy. This was also reinforced by the large sample size we recruited which further helped to ensure that we ruled out spurious sample errors. Boekel et al. (2015) have illustrated the difﬁculty with replicating structural brain–behaviour studies; however, here we have been able to conceptually replicate previous work by maintaining similar VBM methods but changing the regressing measure.  To conclude, we have shown that volumetric differences in brain structure subserve differential expressions of empathy, involving affective and cognitive empathic components. Here we highlight consistencies between functional MRI investigations, as well as lesion based studies surrounding empathy areas, and link this with volumetric differences which underlie these processes. Taken together, the evidence provided here in the structural analysis of a large non-clinical sample further conﬁrms that empathy is a multidimensional construct which elicits differential expressions of affective and cognitive abilities.

However, the hippocampal functional connectivity (HFC) similarities and differences related to these syndromes when they occur alone or coexist are unclear. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (R-fMRI) technique was used to measure left and right HFC in 72 elderly participants (LLD [n = 18], aMCI [n = 17], LLD with comorbid aMCI [n = 12], and healthy controls [n = 25]). The main and interactive relationships of LLD and aMCI on the HFC networks were determined, after controlling for age, gender, education and gray matter volumes. The effects of depressive symptoms and episodic memory deﬁcits on the hippocampal functional connections also were assessed. While increased and decreased left and right HFC with several cortical and subcortical structures involved in mood regulation were related to LLD, aMCI was associated with globally diminished connectivity. Signiﬁcant LLD–aMCI interactions on the right HFC networks were seen in the brain regions critical for emotion processing and higher-order cognitive functions. In the interactive brain regions, LLD and aMCI were associated with diminished hippocampal functional connections, whereas the comorbid group demonstrated enhanced connectivity. Main and interactive effects of depressive symptoms and episodic memory performance were also associated with bilateral HFC network abnormalities. In conclusion, these ﬁndings indicate that discrete hippocampal functional network abnormalities are associated with LLD and aMCI when they occur alone. However, when these conditions coexist, more pronounced vulnerabilities of the hippocampal networks occur, which may be a marker of disease severity and impending cognitive decline. By utilizing R-fMRI technique, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying LLD and aMCI in the functional network level.  © 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  Late-life depression (LLD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are highly prevalent neuropsychiatric syndromes that often coexist in the elderly (Steffens et al., 2006).

LLD and aMCI, alone or in combination, also increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Gauthier et al., 2006; Modrego and Ferrandez, 2004; Ownby et al., 2006). Although LLD and aMCI are considered distinct clinical phenotypes, it is unclear if shared or distinct pathogenic mechanisms are involved in these disorders when they occur alone versus coexists. Neuroimaging investigations have provided unique insights into the hippocampal involvement in LLD and aMCI. The hippocampus is central to the episodic memory formation and has been the focus of AD research for several decades (Dickerson and Eichenbaum, 2010). This brain region is also vital to the dorsal-cognitive system of the mood regulation circuitry (MRC) and is implicated in the neuroanatomical model of LLD (Alexopoulos, 2005). Hippocampal structural abnormalities were evident in individuals with LLD and aMCI, and those with smaller volumes may be at a greater risk for subsequent cognitive decline (Benjamin and Steffens, 2011; Leung et al., 2010; Sexton et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2009; Steffens et al., 2011a).  2213-1582 © 2013 The Authors.

Xie et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 3 (2013) 311–320  Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods have unraveled the functional neuroanatomy of LLD and aMCI. The frontostriatal dysfunction commonly described in LLD is persistent and may only partially improve with antidepressant treatment (Aizenstein et al., 2005, 2009). However, the extent of MTLbased neural circuit abnormalities associated with LLD remains unclear. In contrast, altered hippocampal activation to various memory paradigms has been demonstrated in aMCI (Dickerson and Sperling, 2009; Miller et al., 2008). These fMRI experiments have clariﬁed task-dependent MTL activations or deactivations in LLD and aMCI, but important challenges remain. First, differences in task performance between cognitively healthy and patients with LLD and/or aMCI may complicate data interpretation. Second, neuroimaging investigations have failed to examine the mechanistic similarities and differences between LLD and aMCI, when these conditions occur alone or in combination. Third, while traditional fMRI studies provide critical information into the memory task-dependent differences of specific brain regions, they offer limited conclusions as to how different functionally related structures are interconnected in healthy and diseased states. This is pertinent because LLD and aMCI have been hypothesized as disconnection syndromes affecting the distributed brain networks (Dickerson and Sperling, 2009; Weisenbach et al., 2012).  The resting-state functional connectivity MRI (R-fMRI) technique is based on the observation that temporal interregional correlations of spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent ﬂuctuations exist between functionally coupled but spatially segregated brain regions in the absence of a task (Biswal et al., 1995, 2010; Fox and Raichle, 2007). The brain's organization into multiple, functionally connected networks that subserve various behavioral functions have been identiﬁed using the R-fMRI method in normal and pathological conditions, including depression, and preclinical and clinical AD (Agosta et al., 2012; Alexopoulos et al., 2012; Buckner et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011; Goveas et al., 2011a,b; Greicius et al., 2007; Kenny et al., 2010; Menon and Uddin, 2010; Seeley et al., 2007; Sheline et al., 2010b; Steffens et al., 2011b). The hippocampus is central to the episodic memory network (EMN) and is densely interconnected with functionally related limbic and neocortical regions (Dickerson and Eichenbaum, 2010). The hippocampus is also critical for the brain's interactive and integrative potential to bring together emotion and memory functions (LaBar and Cabeza, 2006). A left–right asymmetry in the hippocampal volumetric and functional connectivity alterations have been reported in LLD, aMCI and/or early AD (Shi et al., 2009; Steffens et al., 2011a; Wang et al., 2006). Greater decreases in hippocampal subregional functional connectivity were associated with episodic memory declines in persons with aMCI (Bai et al., 2011). In contrast, others have demonstrated increased and decreased MTL connectivity with aMCI (Das et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011). Furthermore, predominantly diminished functional connectivity in the hippocampal networks has been demonstrated in AD (Allen et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2006). Regardless, how the disruption in the episodic memory system unfolds in LLD and aMCI, when these disorders appear independently or co-occur remains to be understood.  The primary objective of this study was to investigate the main and interactive effects of LLD and aMCI on the left and right hippocampal functional connectivity in the elderly. We hypothesized that distinct hippocampal functional connectivity (HFC) abnormalities will be seen in LLD and aMCI groups, whereas signiﬁcant interactive effects will be found between LLD and aMCI involving regions critical for emotional regulation and multidomain cognitive functions. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the comorbid group will predominantly drive the HFC disruptions in the interactive regions. As a secondary objective, we also determined the neural correlates of the main and interactive effects of depressive symptoms and episodic memory performance on the HFC networks across all subjects.  2. Material and methods  2.1. Participants  Seventy-two subjects aged 60 and older (cognitively healthy, LLD [n = 18]; aMCI alone [n = 17]; LLD with aMCI [n = 12]; and cognitively normal, nondepressed controls [n = 25]) participated in this study (Xie et al., 2012c). All patients diagnosed as having clinically signiﬁcant depression and/or aMCI were recruited from the Geriatric Psychiatry and Memory Disorders Clinics at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Control subjects were recruited from the community through advertisements. All participants provided written informed consent according to the institution's guidelines for human subject protection.  Study participants received detailed clinical and neuropsychiatric assessments. The core neuropsychological battery administered to all participants included the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (all subjects had to score ≥24); (2) Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 (MDRS-2) (age- and education-corrected MOANS-scaled score of ≥5) (Lucas et al., 1998); (3) education-adjusted Logical Memory II Delayed paragraph recall (LMII-DR) subscale from the Wechsler Memory ScaleRevised (Wechsler, 1987); (4) Physical Self Maintenance Scale/ Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (PSMS/IADL) (Lawton and Brody, 1969); (5) 30-item Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Yesavage et al., 1982); (6) Diagnostic assessment for Axis 1 disorders including the depression module from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (First et al., 2002); and (7) Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). All participants scored ≤4 on the modiﬁed Hachinski ischemic scale (HIS). GDS was repeated again on the day of the imaging scan visit. Clinical assessment ﬁndings were reviewed during the weekly multidisciplinary consensus conferences.  Thirty participants met criteria for clinically signiﬁcant depression according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV TR Axis 1 disorders, research version, non-patient edition [SCID]. Eighteen participants with clinically signiﬁcant depression were included in the cognitively normal LLD group (major depression: n = 17, and minor depression: n = 1). All participants had a GDS score of 10 or above, MMSE ≥ 26, PSMS ≤ 6 and IADL ≤ 9, score above the education-adjusted cutoff on the LMII-DR (Delayed recall score N8 for 16 or more years of education or score N4 for 8–15 years of education).  All participants who also met aMCI criteria with signiﬁcant depression (n = 12) were included in the comorbid LLD and aMCI group (major depression: n = 11, dysthymic disorder: n = 1). Antidepressant doses in both depressed groups had to be at stable doses for at least two weeks before study enrollment and until completion of the study procedures.  Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) was operationally deﬁned according to the established criteria (Winblad et al., 2004): (1) subjective report of cognitive decline; (2) objective cognitive impairment that includes scoring 1.5 SD below on memory measures; (3) intact ADLs and relatively preserved IADLs; and (4) no dementia. For meeting criteria for objective cognitive impairment, participants had to score below the education-adjusted cutoff on the LMII-DR (i.e., ≤8 for 16 or more years of education, and ≤4 for 8–15 years of education), and score below 1.5 SD below the mean on one or more subscales (one of the impairments had to be memory) of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) (Randolph, 1998), Behavioral Dyscontrol scale or the Boston Naming Test. Subjects who met the aMCI criteria and did not have clinically signiﬁcant depression (n = 17) were included in the nondepressed aMCI group.  The control group consisted of participants who did not meet criteria for cognitive or Axis 1 psychiatric disorders and were not on psychoactive medications (n = 25).  Exclusion criteria included past or current history of concurrent Axis 1 psychiatric disorders, such as psychotic or bipolar disorders; alcohol or  C.

MRI acquisition  Imaging was performed using a whole-body 3T Signa GE scanner (Waukesha, WI) with a standard transmit-receive head coil. During the resting-state acquisitions, no cognitive tasks were performed and the participants were instructed to close their eyes, relax and stay awake. Sagittal R-fMRI data sets of the whole brain were obtained in 8 min with a single-shot gradient echo–echo planar imaging pulse sequence. The R-fMRI parameters were: TE = 25 ms, TR = 2000 ms, ﬂip angle of 90°; number of slices = 36; slice thickness = 4 mm, matrix size = 64 × 64 and ﬁeld of view (FOV) = 240 × 240 mm. Highresolution 3D spoiled gradient-recalled echo (SPGR) axial images were acquired for anatomical reference. The parameters were: TE/TR/TI of 4/10/450 ms, ﬂip angle of 12°, number of slices = 144, slice thickness = 1 mm, matrix size = 256 × 192 and FOV = 240 × 240 mm.  2.3. Structural and functional connectivity MRI data processing  2.3.1. R-fMRI preprocessing  R-fMRI data analyses were carried out by using AFNI software (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni) and MATLAB programs (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). The preprocessing steps are identical to the one followed in our previous publications (Goveas et al., 2011a,b; Li et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2012a,b). The spikes in the raw R-fMRI data were removed (3dDespike); motion correction was performed by volume registration on the R-fMRI data (3dvolreg); and detrending was carried out to remove Legendre polynomials (3dDetrend). Possible contamination from the signals in white matter, cerebrospinal ﬂuid, the six-motion vectors, physical noise (cardiac and respiratory signals) and global signal were regressed out from each voxel time series (Birn et al., 2008; Cox, 1996; Fox et al., 2009; Glover et al., 2000; Orfanidis, 1996; Rombouts et al., 2003). A band-pass ﬁlter was applied to isolate spontaneous low-frequency ﬂuctuations within the range of 0.015 Hz and 0.1.  2.3.2. Hippocampal functional connectivity analysis  The left and the right hippocampus regions of interest (ROI) were manually drawn on the coronal slices, with reference to the sagittal and axial slices, and on the structural images of individual subject, as described previously (Rombouts et al., 2003), using AFNI software, after being blinded to the participants' demographics and clinical characteristics. The various processing steps were described previously (Goveas et al., 2011a,b, 2013; Xie et al., 2012b). Brieﬂy, the time courses of these hippocampal voxels were cross-correlated to the time courses of all the voxels in the brain mask, and the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients (r) were obtained, The cross-correlation coefﬁcients (r) were converted to m scores according to Fisher's z transformation for normal distribution [m = 0.5ln(1 + r) / (1 − r)] (Zar, 1996). These voxelwise m values were spatially transformed to the Talairach template coordinates (adwarp), resampled to 2-mm isotropic voxels, and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (6-mm full-width half-maximum) using AFNI software (3dmerge). The end result was the left (L) and the right (R) HFC network maps for each participant.  2.3.3. Structural image processing  Optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed, using the VBM8 toolbox in SPM8 (http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ software/spm8). The individual T1-weighted images for all subjects were segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF) and the summation of them comprised the intracranial volume (ICV). The segmented GM volumes were then normalized,  smoothed at 6-mm full-width half-maximum, and resampled to 2-mm isotropic voxels for further analyses. The voxelwise GM volume was controlled as a covariate in the statistical analyses.  2.4. Statistical analysis  2.4.1. Subject characteristics  Group comparisons for demographic information (age and education), except gender (χ2 test) were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) (signiﬁcance set at p b 0.05 to avoid false negative rate). Neuropsychological measurements were compared by ANCOVA, after controlling for age, gender and education (signiﬁcance threshold at p b 0.0045, Bonferroni corrected) (SPSS 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The sources of the differences between the means of the four groups were examined by post-hoc Fisher's least signiﬁcant difference test for demographics; and the post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected tests were performed when appropriate for neuropsychological measures.  2.4.2. Group-level HFC analysis  Individual HFC maps for each subject were analyzed with a randomeffects one-sample t test to identify voxels, showing a signiﬁcant positive or negative correlation with the seed time series, and the patterns of left and right HFC network for four groups were separately obtained after controlling the effects of age, gender, education and voxelwise GM volume (3dttest++, p b 0.01, corrected with AlphaSim, cluster size N 1042 mm3). To examine the group difference of the LHFC and RHFC networks across all subjects, voxelwise 2 (depression) × 2 (cognitive impairment) ANCOVA was separately performed after controlling for age, gender, education and GM volume (3dRegAna, AFNI) (p b 0.05, corrected with AlphaSim, cluster size N 4048 mm3).  2.4.3. Behavioral signiﬁcance  To investigate the behavioral signiﬁcance of the left and right HFC networks, multiple linear regression analyses were employed (3dRegAna, AFNI) between the individual HFC maps and the GDS and LMII-DR scores across the four groups, using the following equation:  mi ¼ β0 þ β1GDS þ β2LMII‐DR þ β3GDS  LMII‐DR þ β4Age þ β5Gen  þβ6Edu þ β7GM þ β8G0 þ β9G1 þ β10G2 þ β11G3 þ   where mi is the m value of ith voxel across group subjects and β0i is the intercept of straight line ﬁt of the ith group in the model. β1, β2, and β3 are the effects of GDS scores, memory scores (LMII-DR), and interaction of GDS and memory scores on the functional connectivity strength of ith voxel within HFC network, respectively. β4, β5, β6, and β7 are the effects of age, gender, education, and GM volume as covariates of no interest in the above model. G is the group variable in the model; speciﬁcally, β8G0 = 1 if not LLD and not aMCI, 0 otherwise; β9G1 = 1 if LLD and not aMCI, 0 otherwise; β10G2 = 1 if aMCI and not LLD, 0 otherwise; β11G3 = 1 if LLD and aMCI, 0 otherwise. The voxelwise multiple linear regression map was also generated to examine the main and interactive effects of GDS and LMII-DR on the bilateral HFC networks (AlphaSim correction, p b 0.05, cluster size N 4048 mm3).  3. Results  3.1. Demographic and neuropsychological characteristics  Signiﬁcant age and neuropsychiatric measure differences were found; post-hoc analyses revealed the source of differences (Table 1). One-sample patterns of the left and right HFC networks in the four groups are presented in Figs. S1 and S2.  314  C.

The depressed groups demonstrated increased left HFC in the bilateral PCC, and right DMPFC, and decreased anticorrelation (with a reversal of pattern to positive) in the right DLPFC, relative to the nondepressed groups. The mild cognitive impairment (CI) groups showed consistently decreased positive and negative HFC in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), inferior parietal cortex (IPC), retrosplenial cortex (RSC); postcentral gyrus and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) on the left; and right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and superior parietal cortex (SPC). In bilateral DMPFC, and left postcentral gyrus, IPC and pMTG, there is a reversal of pattern from positive to negative correlation in the CI group, relative to non-CI group. Similarly, there is a reversal of negative to positive correlation pattern in the CI group in the right IPC, dACC and SPC compared to the non-CI subjects (Fig. 1).  3.2.1.2. Right HFC network differences. The main effects of depression on the RHFC network included increased HFC in the bilateral thalamus, left hippocampus and right lentiform nucleus; and decreased anticorrelated hippocampal connectivity (with a reversal of pattern to positive correlation) in the bilateral middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and in the left DLPFC and dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen). The main effects of the CI (vs. the non-CI) groups on the RHFC network included consistently diminished positive and negative HFC in bilateral  anterior temporal pole (aTP) and IPC; left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), and pMTG; and right inferior temporal cortex (ITC). The patterns are reversed in all but aTP in the CI groups, relative to non-CI subjects (Fig. 2).  3.2.2. Interactive effects of LLD and cognitive impairment on the HFC networks  The interactive effects of LLD and CI were only identiﬁed on the RHFC network and included the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and MOG bilaterally, left dACC and right DLPFC/dACC cluster (Fig. 3).  3.2.3. The effects of depressive symptoms and memory deﬁcits on the hippocampal networks  The GDS scores positively correlated with the left HFC network in the DMPFC and inferior temporal cortex (ITC) bilaterally; negatively correlated with the left HFC network in the hippocampus/PHG bilaterally, and left DLPFC. The GDS scores positively correlated with the right HFC in the bilateral DMPFC and ITC, right pMTG, and negatively correlated in the bilateral DLPFC, vmPFC, and hippocampus/PHG, left IFG, and right IPC and anterior insula/frontal operculum (aI/fO) (Fig. 4 top row).  LMII-DR scores positively correlated with the left HFC network in the left thalamus, and negatively correlated in the bilateral precuneus/ posterior central gyrus (Pcu/PostCG). LMII-DR scores positively correlated with the RHFC network in the left DMPFC and right ITC and negatively correlated in the amygdala/PHG (Amy/PHG) (Fig. 4 middle row). The GDS–LMII-DR interactions on the left HFC network were found in the left aI/fO, and in the right HFC network were demonstrated in DMPFC, DLPFC and IPC on the right ITC (Fig. 4 bottom row).  C.

Discussion  This study demonstrates that the main and interactive effects of LLD and aMCI are present in the hippocampus-centered EMN in older adults free of dementia. Both increased and decreased HFC with several cortical and subcortical structures involved in emotion processing were related to LLD. aMCI was associated with globally diminished connectivity in cortical and MTL regions. Signiﬁcant LLD and aMCI interactions on the right HFC networks were seen in regions critical for mood regulation and higher-order cognitive functions. We also demonstrated that main and interactive effects of depressive symptoms and episodic memory deﬁcits on the HFC networks exist in the elderly, which is consistent with our prior observations.  4.1. Main effects of depression on the hippocampal functional brain networks  In the left hippocampal networks, we found increased functional connections with the default mode network (DMN) regions. These ﬁndings are consistent with the recent observations in LLD of increased cortical glucose metabolism and DMN functional connectivity (Alexopoulos et al., 2012; Andreescu et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2009). Similar functional connectivity patterns and hyperactivation in the DMN and MTL structures to an emotional regulation paradigm have been demonstrated in younger depressed adults (Sheline et al., 2009, 2010b). Sustained increased activation within the DMN and EMN  structures has been related to greater ruminative thought patterns and severe depressive episodes in major depression.  While LLD was associated with increased right hippocampal network connections with the thalamus, basal ganglia and MTL, diminished hippocampal-DLPFC connectivity was seen. These regions are crucial components of the limbic-cortical-striato-pallido-thalamic circuits implicated in the neurobiological model of depression. The prolonged processing of negative emotions seen in depression is maintained by the impairments of the top-down cognitive control by the DLPFC over the subcortical and limbic structures. Individuals with depression show higher awareness to the negative emotional stimuli, which is ﬁrst relayed to the thalamus, and subsequently transferred and interpreted by the MTL structures (Mayberg, 2003; Phillips et al., 2003). The increased hippocampal connections with the subcortical structures, and decreased HFC-DLPFC functional connectivity found here are consistent with this theory. Moreover, decreased DLPFC connectivity and increased subcortical connectivity are seen in LLD (Alexopoulos et al., 2012). We also identiﬁed diminished right hippocampal connections in the dorsal striatum with a reversal from negative (or anticorrelated) to positive connectivity values in the LLD groups (Fig. 2). The increased periventricular and basal ganglia white matter hyperintensities and decreased structural integrity of the adjacent tracts that is reported in LLD may have contributed to these ﬁndings (Aizenstein et al., 2011; Steffens et al., 2011b). On the contrary, increased dorsal striatal connectivity is reported in LLD, though it is unclear whether contamination from the nuisance variables (white matter, CSF, cardiac, respiratory and global signals) was regressed out in that study (Kenny et al., 2010). A few other possibilities may also  316  C. Xie et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 3 (2013) 311–320  Fig. 2.

The selection of different predeﬁned ROIs and R-fMRI methods in LLD studies makes direct comparisons difﬁcult. Also, several seed-based R-fMRI studies have limited the analyses to only positive connectivity differences, which may have failed to identify  the shifts of connectivity values from negative to positive patterns. While some argue that the negative correlations in R-fMRI analyses are artiﬁcially induced by global signal removal, recent evidence has demonstrated a biological basis to the anticorrelated connectivity (Fox  Fig. 3.

Main effects of cognitive impairment on hippocampal functional brain networks  Our ﬁndings of diminished HFC in the frontal, parietal, temporal and MTL regions in aMCI patients are consistent with the literature (Bai et al., 2011). The hippocampus is extensively interconnected with neocortical association areas and temporal lobe structures. These regions are essential for episodic memory, semantic processing, selfmonitoring and related social cognitive functions, mood regulation and attentional switching, which are often impaired in aMCI. Previously, decreased hippocampal functional connections with similar brain  regions have been reported in patients with aMCI and early AD, and MTL functional disruptions may be indicative of the incipient AD (Sorg et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2006, 2011). Also, the left and right HFC differences did not mirror each other, which are similar to the previous aMCI and early AD studies (Wang et al., 2006, 2011). On the contrary, we found no regions with increased functional connections to the hippocampus as previously reported in one study (Wang et al., 2011). Interestingly, baseline increases were followed by longitudinal decreases in the left and right HFC in aMCI patients, suggesting that the initially observed enhanced connections are a compensatory process (Wang et al., 2011). Moreover, while increased functional connectivity within the MTL subregions was seen in aMCI patients, the MTL connections with the nodes in the DMN and fronto-parietal cortical system were decreased in aMCI in another recent investigation, the latter ﬁndings  318  C. Xie et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 3 (2013) 311–320  are consistent with our data (Das et al., 2013). Additional cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are needed to gain in-depth understanding of the dynamic hippocampal functional connectivity alterations in the normal elderly and aMCI patients.  4.3. Interactive effects of depression and cognitive impairment on HFC networks  Signiﬁcant LLD–aMCI interactions in the hippocampal functional network level were found in the default mode, cognitive control and salience network regions critical for emotion processing, episodic memory and executive function processes. The effects of LLD and aMCI comorbidity on the HFC were greater than the independent effects of these disorders, suggesting that the effects of depression were significantly magniﬁed by comorbid CI, and vice versa. VMPFC is responsible for context-appropriate emotional evaluation of events and stimuli, and reward processing (Brassen et al., 2008; Teasdale et al., 1999). The DLPFC and the dorsal ACC play key roles in conﬂict monitoring, error detection, response selection and mediating executive functions (Alexopoulos et al., 2008). While the ﬁndings in the MOG are intriguing, hypoperfusion in the primary visual cortices is seen in aMCI, and is one of the brain areas that accurately discriminate AD from controls in R-fMRI studies (Caroli et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2011). In these interactive brain regions, when LLD and nondepressed aMCI subjects demonstrated decreased functional connectivity, patients with coexisting LLD and aMCI showed signiﬁcantly enhanced connections. These ﬁndings were present despite the fact that the comorbid group demonstrated comparable levels of depression severity as the LLD-only group and a similar degree of cognitive deﬁcits as the nondepressed aMCI subjects.  The coexistence of subclinical and syndromal LLD with aMCI is associated with greater gray and white matter atrophy, cognitive decline and conversion to AD (Lee et al., 2012; Modrego and Ferrandez, 2004; Xie et al., 2012c). In individuals at-risk for AD, increased functional connectivity and increased activation to memory tasks in the prefrontal and MTL regions have been hypothesized as compensatory recruitment of neural resources to maintain adequate cognitive performance or a transient phase that represent impending failure of neuronal networks (Sperling et al., 2010). For instance, greater hippocampal activation predicted those individuals with aMCI at highest risk for subsequent cognitive decline in one study (Miller et al., 2008). Major depression also has been associated with increased DMN and affective network functional connectivity (Alexopoulos et al., 2012; Greicius et al., 2007; Sheline et al., 2010b). Taken together, our data may reﬂect a compensatory process whereby the comorbid group is recruiting additional neural resources to improve cognitive functions, a transient response of a failing functional network and/or an effect of the depressed state.  4.4. Neural correlates of the effects of depressive symptoms and episodic memory on HFC networks  Greater depressive symptom severity was associated with mostly increased positive and anticorrelated HFC bilaterally in several frontal, parietal and temporal areas, which are consistent with our previous results (Goveas et al., 2011a) as well as the LLD group ﬁndings. The DLPFC, inferior parietal, frontal opercular and insular cortices, which are regions associated with executive control, attentional and salience processing, were functionally anticorrelated to the hippocampus (i.e., blue color in these regions represent increased anticorrelations being related to greater depressive symptom severity) (Fig. 4A top row). increased hippocampal-DLPFC connectivity was associated with greater depressive symptom severity, after regressing out the subject group effects. These results suggest that the diminished hippocampal-DLPFC functional connections seen in LLD may be a disorder-speciﬁc phenomenon.  In contrast,  We also found positive correlations between HFC and LMII-DR in the medial prefrontal and inferior temporal cortices, and thalamus  (i.e., increased hippocampal connections were related to better episodic memory performance) (Fig. 4A middle row). However, we found an opposite relationship where poorer memory was associated with increased hippocampal connections in the sensorimotor, precuneus and the MTL regions, which are contrary to the aMCI group ﬁndings. It is possible that older adults with poorer episodic memory compensate by enhancing functional connections in these regions. An alternative explanation is that decreased MTL and posterior default mode functional connections are speciﬁc to the neurodegenerative disease-state. The differences in sample sizes, inclusion/exclusion criteria and the HFC assessments separately (versus combined in the previous study (Goveas et al., 2011a) may also have contributed to the discrepancies.  The GDS and LMII-DR interactive effects on the HFC in the default mode, fronto-parietal and salience regions (Fig. 4A bottom row) are similar to our prior ﬁndings (Goveas et al., 2011a). Future studies that examine the HFC alterations speciﬁc to different affective and cognitive disorders versus dimensional measures should be conducted.  4.5. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms  LLD may share common pathophysiologic mechanisms with aMCI and AD. Patients with remitted geriatric depression that met aMCI criteria had cortical amyloid accumulation comparable to that seen in AD (Butters et al., 2008). Signiﬁcantly higher amyloid and tau deposition in the PCC and temporal lobes in symptomatic individuals with LLD were recently reported (Kumar et al., 2011). Other mechanisms may be shared between LLD and aMCI, including subclinical cerebrovascular disease, genetic variations, proinﬂammatory cytokines and oxidative stress (Kumar et al., 2008; Mufson et al., 2012). Separate mechanisms may differentially contribute to the abnormal hippocampal functional integrity when LLD and aMCI occur alone. However, a multiple neurobiological vulnerabilities may be present in those with comorbidities that may lead to more pronounced HFC abnormalities and subsequent cognitive decline.  4.6. Limitations  First, we are unable to make ﬁrm conclusions if the increased HFC in the comorbid group reﬂects a compensatory process of a failing network and/or an effect of the depressed state. Longitudinal studies are essential to elucidate this hypothesis. Second, the sample in the comorbid group is relatively small, and our results need to be replicated in larger studies. Third, an ideal study design would be to include antidepressantfree participants to eliminate potential confounding effects. However, since the majority of our depressed participants had failed at least one therapeutic antidepressant trial and had moderate-to-severe depression (LLD only: N = 9; comorbid group: N = 10), the ethical aspects restricted us from performing such a study. Similarly, while acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) and memantine are not approved for treatment of aMCI, physicians commonly prescribe these medications offlabel to those with aMCI with and without coexisting LLD (McClendon et al., 2009; Reynolds et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2010). Therefore, as long as aMCI patients were on stable doses and the dosages were not expected to change during the study participation, cognitive enhancer use was allowed. Fourth, although we excluded subjects with unstable medical conditions and all participants had to score within the normal range on the modiﬁed HIS, varying levels of cerebrovascular and chronic medical disease burden across groups may have inﬂuenced our ﬁndings.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, discrete HFC abnormalities were associated with LLD and aMCI, whereas interplay between these syndromes was present in the hippocampal network level involving hubs of the commonly described intrinsic resting-state networks. Interestingly, these differences were predominantly driven by differences between the comorbid and  C. Xie et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 3 (2013) 311–320  319  other subject groups. Future R-fMRI studies should determine changes in the hippocampal functional connectivity over time in LLD patients with and without aMCI, as it relates to the risk of future cognitive decline and incident dementia.

These models are consistent with considerable ﬁndings showing a link between low levels of self-eﬃcacy and PTSD. A growing body of work has demonstrated that perceptions of self-eﬃcacy can be enhanced experimentally in healthy subjects and participants with PTSD, and increasing levels of self-eﬃcacy improves performance on cognitive, aﬀective, and problem-solving tasks. This study aimed to determine whether increasing perceptions of selfeﬃcacy in participants with PTSD would be associated with changes in neural processing. Combat veterans (N = 34) with PTSD were randomized to either a high self-eﬃcacy (HSE) induction, in which they were asked to recall memories associated with successful coping, or a control condition before undergoing resting state fMRI scanning. Two global network measures in four neural circuits were examined. Participants in the HSE condition showed greater right-lateralized path length and decreased right-lateralized connectivity in the emotional regulation and executive function circuit. In addition, area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) analyses found that average connectivity (.71) and path length (.70) moderately predicted HSE group membership. These ﬁndings provide further support for the importance of enhancing perceived control in PTSD, and doing so may engage neural targets that could guide the development of novel interventions.  1. Introduction  In the wake of a traumatic event, a signiﬁcant minority of individuals will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a psychiatric disorder characterized by intrusive memories, avoidance of stimuli associated with the event, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and disturbances in arousal (APA, DSM-5, 2013). Estimates of lifetime PTSD in the United States range from 6.8% to 8.7%, (Kessler et al., 2005). Rates of PTSD among those serving in military operations often appear to be higher, as a recent meta–analysis reported that the estimated lifetime prevalence among those who served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom was 23% (Fulton et al., 2015).  Over the past two and a half decades, considerable progress has been made in characterizing the neural, genetic, physiological, molecular, endocrinological, and immunological alterations associated with PTSD (Heim and Nemeroﬀ, 2009; Pitman et al., 2012; Shalev et al.,  2017; Yehuda et al., 2015). Such work has led to numerous studies examining brain regions implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder (Etkin, 2010; Fonzo et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2012; Rauch et al., 2006; Shalev et al., 2017). Recent work aimed at developing neurocircuitry models of PTSD through the integration of existing research has identiﬁed four circuits that may underlie the core symptoms clusters of PTSD (Shalev et al., 2017).  Speciﬁcally, Shalev et al. (2017) proposed that interconnected brain structures within these four circuits underlie fear learning, exaggerated threat detection, diminished emotional regulation and executive function, and altered contextual processing (see Table 1 for list of brain structures and neural circuits). Although PTSD has been conceptualized as the result of alterations in a distributed network of neural structures throughout the whole brain, Shalev, Liberzon and Marmar's (2017) neurocircuitry models oﬀer a novel framework for examining the interrelations among brain structures in order to further characterize the disorder and identify therapeutic targets. For example, fear learning has  ∗ Corresponding author. Department of Psychiatry, New York University School of Medicine, 1 Park Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY, 10016, USA.

Abnormalities in amygdala functioning in PTSD have been attributed to deﬁcits in fear extinction, safety learning, and extinction recall (Jovanovic et al., 2012; Milad et al., 2009). Threat detection, characterized by attentional biases to threatening stimuli, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle, has been linked with alterations in the amygdala, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and the insula (Seeley et al., 2007). Alterations in emotional regulation and executive function are associated with decreased engagement of the dorsolateral (dlPFC), ventrolateral (vlPFC) and dorsomedial (dmPFC) prefrontal cortex in clinical and non-clinical studies (e.g. Buhle et al., 2014; Ochsner et al., 2012). Furthermore, studies with PTSD patients have found reduced connectivity within the fronto-parietal regions, which is believed to be associated with impaired executive functioning (Sripada et al., 2012). Contextual processing appears to be impaired in PTSD contributing to diﬃculty distinguishing between safe and threatening stimuli. Functional brain imaging research has shown the ability to distinguish between safety and threat cues is supported by signaling between the mPFC and the hippocampus (Lang et al., 2009), and studies have found volumetric and functional abnormalities of the hippocampus among individuals with PTSD (e.g. Pitman et al., 2012; Shin and Liberzon, 2010). Additionally, alterations in signaling in the mPFC have been shown to interfere with the processing of contextual information, to learning (Rougemont-Bücking et al., 2011).  impaired safety-signal  and contribute  Among factors that might help to better understand the engagement of neural circuits in the pathogenesis of PTSD is human self-regulation in response to stress and trauma. It has been well documented that in the wake a traumatic event, perceptions of the self may be altered (e.g. Benight and Bandura, 2004; Ehlers and Clarke, 2000), and numerous studies have found that maladaptive perceptions of one's self are strongly associated with PTSD (Bryant and Guthrie, 2007; Dekel et al., 2013). Negative changes in self-appraisals may be a critical mechanism underlying PTSD as it relates to one's ability to engage in self-regulatory processes, which facilitate adaptions to stress and trauma. According to Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), the capacity to adapt to stress depends, in part, on one's ability to successfully employ personal (adaptive cognitive appraisals), environmental (social support), and behavioral (proactive coping) strategies that facilitate goal attainment and a sense of agency.  Self-appraisals about one's ability to respond to stress may then lead to development of self-eﬃcacy perceptions around coping (Benight and Bandura, 2004). There is considerable evidence suggesting that selfeﬃcacy inﬂuences how individuals respond to potentially traumatic events (for a review see Benight and Bandura, 2004). Self-eﬃcacy is described as one's self-perceived ability to inﬂuence command over personal thoughts, behaviors, and emotions, as well as the external environment (Bandura, 1997). Lower levels of self-eﬃcacy have been associated with PTSD among a wide range of trauma-exposed populations (e.g. Benight and Bandura, 2004; Bosmans and Van der Velden, 2015; Cieslak et al., 2008; Ehlers et al., 1998a,b; Piotrkowski and  59  Journal of Psychiatric Research 104 (2018) 58–64  Brannen, 2002; Saigh et al., 1995; Solomon et al., 1991). In addition, experimental research has found that increasing perceptions of self-efﬁcacy leads to more adaptive cognitive and aﬀective processing when exposed to stress (Geer et al., 1970; Glass et al., 1973; Litt et al., 1993; Sanderson et al., 1989). Importantly, self-eﬃcacy may also be an important mechanism underlying recovery, as low levels of self-eﬃcacy have been associated with poor treatment outcome (e.g. Ehlers et al., 1998a,b).  Of particular relevance to the treatment of PTSD, an emerging body of research is showing perceptions of self-eﬃcacy in coping can be manipulated, and doing so leads to improved performance on cognitive and aﬀective processes that may aid in recovery from PTSD. For example, in two studies with healthy controls, Brown and colleagues (Brown et al., 2012a, 2012b) used a false feedback technique in which participants were told that, in response to a stressful event, they were either in the top 1% or bottom 30% of copers. Although the two groups did not diﬀer on levels of self-eﬃcacy before the induction, those in the high self-eﬃcacy condition self-reported signiﬁcantly higher levels of self-eﬃcacy after the experimenter feedback. Following this induction, participants generated autobiographical memories and imagined personal future events with greater episodic speciﬁcity (2012a), performed better on a social problem-solving task (2012a), and reported fewer visual intrusions and less distress following a trauma ﬁlm-paradigm (2012b). In addition, Zlomuzica et al. (2015) employed a similar falsefeedback technique in healthy individuals before a fear conditioning task, and found that self-eﬃcacy induction facilitated extinction learning as measured by self-report and electrodermal activity.  In an eﬀort to increase self-eﬃcacy in clinical populations without utilizing false-feedback, Brown et al. (2016) recently demonstrated that self-eﬃcacy can be increased through the recall of autobiographical memories of successful coping. In a sample of OEF/OIF combat veterans with and without PTSD, participants were randomized to either a high self-eﬃcacy or control condition. Those in the high self-eﬃcacy condition were asked to recall three autobiographical memories associated with times they demonstrated successful coping, whereas in the control condition they were asked to recall any three important memories. Participants in the high self-eﬃcacy condition subsequently reported higher levels of self-eﬃcacy. In addition, those in the high self-eﬃcacy condition imagined future events characterized by greater agency and demonstrated better performance on a military-related social-problem solving task (Brown et al., 2016). Employing a similar method for increasing self-eﬃcacy through autobiographical memory, Morina et al. (2017) showed that torture survivors asked to recall self-eﬃcacy related memories exhibited greater distress tolerance on a mirror-tracing task. Such ﬁndings suggest that increasing self-eﬃcacy may help to engage cognitive processes adaptive for recovery.  However, studies have yet to examine whether increasing levels of self-eﬃcacy may lead to neural changes associated with recovery. Speciﬁcally, this study aimed to test whether using autobiographical memory self-eﬃcacy induction (Brown et al., 2016) would lead to changes within four neural circuits that have been implicated in PTSD (Shalev et al., 2017). Brain imaging research with healthy individuals and PTSD populations would suggest that experimental manipulations aimed to increase self-regulatory processes, such as perceptions of selfeﬃcacy, would engage the prefrontal cortex (e.g. Curtis & D'Esposito, 2003; Heatherton, 2011; Goldberg, 2001; Miller and Cohen, 2001). Considerable work has found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) play key roles in self-regulation in response to aﬀective stimuli (for a review see Heatherton, 2011). Moreover, neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation have consistently found that the PFC is engaged in top-down regulatory processes when individuals are attempting to regulate responses to negative stimuli (e.g. Davidson et al., 2000; Ochsner et al., 2004; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). Therefore, although the four neural circuits proposed by Shalev et al. (2017) were examined in this study, it was predicted that changes in the emotional  R.F. Titcombe-Parekh et al.  Journal of Psychiatric Research 104 (2018) 58–64  regulation and executive function (ER/EF) circuit were most likely to be associated with an increase in self-eﬃcacy.  To investigate the potential impact of self-eﬃcacy on the four neural circuits associated with PTSD, graph-theory network analysis was utilized to examine the topological properties of brain networks (e.g. Bassett and Bullmore, 2006). Graph theory has been translated and applied to model the brain as a complex network represented by sets of nodes and edges (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Wang et al., 2016). Studies of healthy individuals employing graph theory have shown that human brain networks exhibit many complex organizational features, including small-worldness (a brain network characterized by high efﬁciency of information transfer at a low cost) and modularity (the partition of a brain network into smaller functional communities of modules, Achard et al., 2006; He et al., 2007). Graph theory analyses have also been able to distinguish psychiatric from healthy individuals in numerous studies (Bassett et al., 2012; Leistedt et al., 2009; Lynall et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011). For example, compared to traumaexposed individuals without PTSD, PTSD patients exhibit decreased path length, as well as increased clustering coeﬃcient, global eﬃciency and local eﬃciency (Lei et al., 2015). Additionally, a recent study of adolescent females with PTSD found that greater network modularity and assortativity, as well as lesser eﬃciency were associated with better response to treatment (Cisler et al., 2016). In contrast, a recent study of children diagnosed with PTSD showed an increase in path length, and decreased local and global eﬃciency (Suo et al., 2015). The authors suggest that diﬀerences in ﬁndings may be related to the way in which stress aﬀects the brain at diﬀerent stages of human development, which warrants further research (Suo et al., 2015).  This study is the ﬁrst to look at whether recalling autobiographical memories of self-eﬃcacy may have the potential to alter neural circuits associated with PTSD pathology. OEF/OIF combat veterans with PTSD were randomized to either a high self-eﬃcacy induction (HSE) in which they recalled autobiographical memories related to self-eﬃcacy or a no self-eﬃcacy induction (NSE) control condition. Functional MRI (fMRI) was then used to measure resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in previously identiﬁed neural circuits functioning in fear learning, threat detection, emotional regulation and executive function, and contextual processing. Although meta-analyses provide a powerful method for identifying alterations in resting state activity in PTSD (e.g. Disner et al., 2018; Hayes et al., 2012; Koch et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2012; Ramage et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016), due to the heterogeneity of ﬁndings, the regions of interest in this study were based on those neural circuits identiﬁed in the framework proposed by Shalev et al. (2017). This model speciﬁcally aims to link abnormalities in neural circuits with the core symptom clusters in PTSD aﬀording it potential utility as a conceptual and empirical guide in the apriori identiﬁcation of speciﬁc dysregulated circuits to be used in the assessment of interventions (Sheynin and Liberzon, 2017).  Two network measures of brain connectivity, average connectivity and path length, were analyzed for each circuit to assess for changes associated with high self-eﬃcacy induction in participants. Given previous ﬁndings from graph theory analyses showing that PTSD was associated with decreased path length and greater connectivity, it was predicted that increasing self-eﬃcacy among individuals with PTSD would be associated with reduced connectivity and greater path length. Furthermore, although this hypothesis was examined in all four neural circuits, given previous ﬁndings on the primary role of the prefrontal cortex in self-regulation, it was expected that these patterns would be most evident in the ER/EF circuit.  2. Method  2.1. Participants  Thirty-four male OEF/OIF combat veterans with PTSD were recruited for this study. Veterans were recruited from the Mental Health  60  Services of the Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn Veterans Aﬀairs Medical Centers, other regional VA medical centers, Veterans Service Organizations, National Guard, reservist agencies and organizations, and from the general community. Recruitment methods included ﬂyers, in-person presentations, media advertisements, internet postings (e.g. Craigslist), and referrals from clinicians. Participants were excluded if they had a life-time history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, major depression with psychotic features, or were less than two months stable on psychotropic medications. Participants received $100 USD for their participation.  considered  positive  for PTSD if  Participants were  their Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS, Foa, 1995) score was ≥24, and they reported impairment for at least one month (Sheeran and Zimmerman, 2002). Half of the participants were randomized to the HSE induction and half were randomized to the NSE control condition. All subjects provided informed written consent for this protocol, which was approved by NYU School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.  2.2. Procedure  Prior to scanning, participants completed clinical self-report measures including the General Self-Eﬃcacy Scale (GSE, Schwarzer and Jerusalem, 1995), the Combat Exposure Scale (CES, Keane et al., 1989), the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS, Foa, 1995), and the Beck Depression Inventory-second edition (BDI-II, Beck et al., 1996) (Table 2).  Veterans with PTSD were randomized to HSE induction or NSE control condition. Following the protocol of Brown et al. (2016), in the HSE induction, subjects were asked to recall in detail three autobiographical memories reﬂecting times when they demonstrated high self-eﬃcacy. The experimenter then summarized the recollected event emphasizing the strengths exhibited by the subject at that time, and had the subject also reﬂect on these strengths. NSE control subjects were asked to recall three signiﬁcant life events, and did not engage in speciﬁc reﬂections of strengths and successes. Given that the NSE did not receive additional feedback about their self-eﬃcacy memories, in order to control for contact time with the experimenter, the experimenter spent an additional 5 min providing general information about the MRI procedure with each participant in the NSE condition. All participants then underwent MRI scan to collect resting-state fMRI data.  2.3. MRI data acquisition  The resting-state fMRI data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner (Skyra, Siemens, 20-ch head coil) with Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence: repetition time 2000 ms, echo time 30 ms, ﬂip angle 90°, slice number 36, slice thickness 4 mm, slice gap 0, ﬁeld of view 20 cm, matrix size 66 × 66. Anatomical images were acquired using the same scanner with a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence: repetition time 2300 ms, echo time 2.98 ms, ﬂip angle 9°,  Table 2 Demographic and clinical self-report data for OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD.

Throughout the scan, subjects were instructed to lay in the scanner supine, awake, and to remain still. Foam pads were inserted to restrict head motion.  2.4. Data preprocessing  The fMRI data was pre-processed with a customized program based on FSL (FMRIB, Oxford) modules, including brain extraction, motion correction and special registration to MNI 152 template with 2 mm voxel size. The ﬁrst ﬁve volumes were removed. The motion correction was conducted using FSL mcFLIRT (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/ fslwiki/MCFLIRT). The data were residualized with respect to six motion parameters estimated from mcFLIRT to account for motion eﬀects. No subject was excluded in our study for excessive head motion. Time points were censored if their displacement was beyond 0.5 mm, and the remaining time points were processed for connectivity measurements. No subject had > 40 censored time points to be completely excluded from the study. Volumes with framewise-displacement of > 0.5 mm were removed from the data to further reduce motion-related artifact. The non-linear registration to MNI 152 template (2 mm voxels) was performed using FSL FNIRT (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/ FNIRT). Registration from functional to anatomical images was estimated using FSL implementation of boundary-based registration (fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT_BBR).  The ROIs from diﬀerent circuits were located on the template using a predeﬁned atlas or combining labels from Freesurfer (Version 5.3, Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging) (Table 3). The time courses were averaged over the voxels within the same ROIs. The connectivity scores between two ROIs were computed by the Pearson product-moment correlation of corresponding average time courses, and then transformed to Fisher z-scores. Global measurements of network, including average connectivity and average path length, were computed by Brian Connectivity Toolbox (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010).  2.5. Statistical analysis  The group diﬀerences of global network measurements between HSE and NSE subjects were tested with the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests, carried by the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox in Matlab (Version, 2015b; Mathworks Inc.). Analyses did not control for multiple comparisons given the a priori selection of the four neural circuits identiﬁed in the model proposed by Shalev et al. (2017). In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated for average connectivity and path length measurements to illustrate performance classiﬁcation.

Results  Participant ages ranged from 23 to 51. Regarding race, 46% of participants identiﬁed as White, 30% as Black or African American, 20% as Hispanic, and 3% as Multiracial. Participants in the HSE and NSE conditions did not diﬀer on age or measures of pre-induction selfeﬃcacy. In addition, those in the HSE and NSE did not diﬀer on selfreported levels of combat exposure nor symptom severity of PTSD or depression (p > .05; Table 2).  The mean and 95% conﬁdence interval of network measurements are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. P-values (unadjusted) for group diﬀerences in two global network measurements for the four PTSD neural circuits are shown in Table 4. Among the four circuits, signiﬁcant diﬀerences in network measurements were observed in the right ER/EF circuit (Fig. 3).

Comparison of HSE and NSE conditions revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in both average connectivity and path length in the ER/EF circuit. Speciﬁcally, those in the HSE condition exhibited reduced right-lateralized average connectivity (p < .05) and greater right-lateralized path length (p < .05) in the ER/EF circuit. In addition, AUC analyses found that average connectivity (.71; Fig. 4) and path length (.70; Fig. 5) in right ER/EF moderately predicted HSE group membership.  4. Discussion  These ﬁndings suggest that strategies aimed at increased perceptions of self-eﬃcacy in PTSD may inﬂuence neural circuits associated with emotional regulation and executive function. These results build on a growing body of behavioral studies with clinical and healthy control subjects showing that increasing perceptions of self-eﬃcacy through experimental inductions leads to better performance on various emotional regulation tasks. (Brown et al., 2012a, 2012b; Morina et al., 2018; Zlomuzica et al., 2015).  These ﬁndings also add to the SCT framework emphasizing the importance of self-regulation as a key factor in human adaptation to stress and adversity (Benight and Bandura, 2004). Considerable work has established that maladaptive self-perceptions following trauma play a key role in the onset and maintenance of PTSD. Such negative  Fig. 4.

In the context of SCT, high self-eﬃcacy induction may lead to greater self-regulation through the recall of memories associated with goal attainment and agency. Although the construct of self-regulation was not measured in this experiment, SCT theory would predict that individuals will become more successful at regulating responses when they can draw on experiences of mastery to manage current stressors (Bandura, 1997).  The neural diﬀerences observed in the ER/EF circuit between those in the HSE and NSE conditions may be in line with studies comparing individuals with PTSD to controls (Brown et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2015). Path length and functional connectivity have been associated with the transmission of information and functional integration in the brain (e.g. Wang et al., 2009). In other studies, shorter path length has been attributed to an imbalance between local specialization and global  Fig. 3. ROIs in right ER/EF circuit overlaid on structural brain image. Note.

Titcombe-Parekh et al.  Journal of Psychiatric Research 104 (2018) 58–64  whether the observed changes in neural circuits correspond with selfreported changes in perceived coping capability.  Despite these limitations, this study oﬀers novel ﬁndings as well as possibilities for future research to better understand the relationship between perceptions of self-eﬃcacy and adaptation to adversity and trauma. For example, while this study employed the General SelfEﬃcacy Scale to assess global perceptions of self-eﬃcacy, additional work using the Trauma-Coping Self-Eﬃcacy Scale (CSE-T, Benight et al., 2015) could asses changes in neural circuits associated with perceptions of one's ability to manage speciﬁc demands in the wake of trauma. Additionally, this study examined the impact of a self-eﬃcacy induction on resting state activity, but future task-based fMRI studies will be important to further examine neural responses to the enhancement of self-eﬃcacy in PTSD. Although behavioral studies with healthy and PTSD populations have begun to document some of the positive outcomes associated with experimentally increasing self-eﬃcacy (e.g. Brown et al., 2012a, 2012b; 2016; Morina et al., 2018; Zlomuzica et al., 2015), neural activity in response to emotion regulation and cognitive tasks following a self-eﬃcacy induction in PTSD remains to be investigated through brain imaging. Studies such as these may help to better understand relationships between self-eﬃcacy and the other three circuits (salience detection, fear learning, and contextual processing) that did not show changes in this study but may become targets in the context of speciﬁc tasks. Future work will continue to explore how enhancing perceptions of self-eﬃcacy may serve as an eﬀective therapeutic intervention to help patients with PTSD overcome persistent negative eﬀects of trauma by facilitating cognitive reframing in order to promote more adaptive problem solving and future thinking. Moreover, self-eﬃcacy interventions could also be investigated as a potential preventive tool utilized to prophylactically enhance resilience, a possibility that could be particularly relevant for military personnel prior to warzone deployments.

Thus, those with PTSD in the NSE condition may be exhibiting greater disturbance in the balance of brain networks. Although additional research is needed to determine the effect of self-eﬃcacy on neural circuitry implicated in PTSD, these ﬁndings suggest that a high self-eﬃcacy intervention could possibly target emotional regulation and executive function circuitry and have a mitigating eﬀect on speciﬁc neural changes associated with this disorder. Interestingly, these ﬁndings in the ER/EF circuit converge with considerable research on self-regulation and emotion regulation showing the importance of prefrontal top-down executive function processes in response to stress (e.g. Ochsner et al., 2004; Ochsner et al., 2012). Therefore, strategies aimed at increasing coping ability through the modiﬁcation of self-appraisals, such as perceptions of coping self-eﬃcacy, may be targeting the prefrontal cortex.  that  While signiﬁcant progress in the understanding and treatment of PTSD has been made over the past several decades, current therapeutic options are not fully eﬀective, and there remains limited evidence on the ability of these treatments to target speciﬁc neural circuits implicated in PTSD (e.g. Malejko et al., 2017). The ﬁndings in this study suggest increasing self-eﬃcacy through the recall of autobiographical memories may serve as a non-pharmacological, non-invasive cognitive strategy for engaging neural targets that might aid in the treatment of PTSD. Limitations of this study include a relatively small sample size, and a study population speciﬁcally focused on male combat veterans. Additionally, while this study found potential neural diﬀerences associated with a self-eﬃcacy induction, the current work is unable to establish whether this leads to a reduction in PTSD symptoms. This study was also comprised entirely of individuals with PTSD. Additional research is needed to clarify whether these ﬁndings are speciﬁc to PTSD or would also be observed in healthy controls. Furthermore, the neural circuits in this study were guided by the neurobiological model characterized by Shalev et al. (2017). Future work would beneﬁt from examining whether increasing self-eﬃcacy inﬂuences other neural circuits and structures linked with PTSD, such as reward circuitry (e.g. Elman et al., 2009). Moreover, although a self-report measure of selfeﬃcacy was completed prior to the induction to show that levels of selfeﬃcacy did not diﬀer at baseline, a measure of self-eﬃcacy was not included post-induction.

Introduction  Emotions are deﬁned as episodic and synchronized changes in the organism reﬂecting the quick identiﬁcation of salient stimuli in the environment and the production of adaptive behavioral and physiological responses. Although transient, emotional episodes are critical to survival and have strong and persistent inﬂuence on cognitive processes such as perception, attention, memory and decision-making (Dolan, 2002). Several components are usually considered in the study of emotion including physiological arousal, behavioral and motor expression, cognitive appraisal and subjective experience. At three models proposed in the  least  E-mail address: philippe.fossati@psl.aphp.fr  neuroscience of emotion mechanisms conceptualize the relationships between these different components: (1) basic emotion model; (2) dimensional feeling model; and (3) component process model (see Table 1; Scherer, 1984).  It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss each model but they all highlight the role of strategic brain regions for emotion perception, response and regulation. The so-called ‘emotional brain’ is composed of corticolimbic structures, such as medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, subcortical structures including basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus (Phillips et al., 2003). We propose here to review the role of the amydgala and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in emotion processing. Because of their putative role in the pathophysiology of emotional disorders, such as anxiety or mood disorders, we decided to focus only on these regions.  0924-977X/$ - see front matter & 2012 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Different models of emotion (see Grandjean  Basic emotion model  Dimensional feeling model  Component process model  This model distinguishes basic emotion from complex emotion. Basic emotion (i.e. fear, disgust, sadness, joy, surprise, anger) responses are provoked by speciﬁc events and are associated with speciﬁc physiological activation, facial expression and action tendencies. Basic emotions involve speciﬁc neural structures. According to this model fear is associated with a ‘circuit of fear’ with the amygdala as a core region of this circuit.  Emotions are here considered as verbal report of subjective feeling along several dimensions (valence, arousal). Emotion can be classiﬁed on different axes (positive– negative; approach– withdrawal). Within this model the prefrontal cortex especially the ventromedial prefrontal plays a major role in emotional processing as a hub for deﬁning affective meaning (Roy et al., 2012)  In this model, emotions are conceptualized as episodic changes in different subsystems (cognition, facial expression, physiological responses, subjective feeling) determined by salient stimuli pertinent for the survival of the organism. Changes are transient and synchronized and allow for ﬂexible adaptation to the environment. Appraisal, the process of evaluating the salience and importance of stimuli, is a central component of this model.  2. Methods  We conducted a qualitative review of studies on emotion processing with a special emphasis on neuroimaging studies. Studies on brain activation using fMRI were identiﬁed by a systematic search in Medline for English language manuscripts. The search query consisted of the MeSH terms: ‘FMRI and ‘Amygdala AND Fear detection’; ‘Amygdala AND Self relevance’; ‘Medial prefrontal Cortex AND Self Processing’; ‘Amygdala AND social cognition’.  3. Results  3.1. The amygdala: a threat detector?  Animal studies have made an important contribution to understanding of the anatomical and functional architecture of the amygdala. The primate amygdala is a nuclear complex composed of more than 10 nuclei, situated in the anterior part of the medial temporal lobe (LeDoux, 2007). In the primate, the basolateral nucleus receives projections from the thalamus and all sensory cortices and is connected to the central nucleus, the amygdaloid  the output  region of  complex. The amygdala has highly speciﬁc reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex. Among the prefrontal cortex, posterior orbito-frontal cortex and the ventral part of the anterior cingulate (i.e. Brodman area 25) show the strongest connections with the amygdala (Ghashghaei et al., 2007).  The amygdala sends widespread projections to subcortical and cortical areas such as basal fore-brain, striatum, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and sensory cortices (Amunts et al., 2005). The functional consequences of these projections and reciprocal connections remain to be fully understood.  However, special attention has been paid to the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning and threat detection. Fear conditioning is a form of emotional learning that describes how a neutral stimulus may become aversive and may elicit defensive behaviors (Phelps and LeDoux, 2005). In this type of experiment the subject or the animal is exposed to an emotional neutral stimuli (CS) such as a visual stimuli or a tone, paired with an aversive unconditioned stimuli (UCS; i.e. electric shock). An association is formed between the CS and US, and later presentation of the CS alone induces behavioral defense responses and associated autonomic and endocrine changes. Both animal and human brain imaging studies have demonstrated the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning (B¨uchel and Dolan, 2000; Phelps and LeDoux, 2005). Consistent with its role in fear acquisition, selective lesions of the amygdala impaired fear processing (see patient SM; Feinstein et al., 2011). Patients with amygdala damage have reduced experience of fear, a fact to be related to abnormal response to fear signals in patients with anxiety disorders. Likewise, patients with amygdala lesions showed reduced response to a fearful face. A recent meta-analysis (Fusar-Poli et al., 2009) of brain imaging studies revealed that the processing of human faces activates several brain areas including visual cortex, limbic areas, parieto-temporal cortex, prefrontal areas, putamen, cerebellum and amygdala. The amygdala was mainly but not speciﬁcally associated with the processing of fearful faces (see also Adolphs, 2008).  The contribution of the amygdala to fear processing has led many authors to conclude that the amygdala may be speciﬁcally devoted to the processing of fear-related stimuli (Ohman and Mineka, 2001). From an evolutionary perspective, the amygdala would constitute a modular system (a fear module) shaped by evolution to quickly and automatically respond to fearful or threatening stimuli. Such a ‘threat detector’ hypothesis would be consistent with basic emotion models suggesting that primary basic emotions are associated with unique physiological and behavioral responses and involve speciﬁc brain regions (Ekman, 1992).  3.2. Amygdala: from fear processing to detection of self-relevance  Brain imaging studies have challenged the ‘amygdala as a threat detector’ hypothesis. Several fMRI studies have shown that fear is not the only negative emotion that activates the amygdala. Anger and sadness faces were also shown to evoke amygdala responses (Blair et al., 1999; Fusar-Poli et al., 2009; Whalen et al., 2001). Moreover several studies suggest that positive emotional stimuli (i.e. happy face) activate the  Neural correlates of emotion processing: From emotional to social brain  S489  amygdala. One meta-analysis indicates that the effect-size of activation of the amygdala is even greater for positive stimuli than negative stimuli (Sergerie et al., 2008). Overall these results emphasize the need to deﬁne more precisely the computational role of the amygdala. Some tenants of the dimensional model of emotion argued that arousal and intensity are the main features of stimuli driving amygdala activation (Russell, 2003). As negative stimuli are usually more arousing and intense than positive stimuli this could explain the apparent bias for fearful faces in amygdala activation. Consistent with this interpretation Costafreda et al. (2008) found in their meta-analysis on the role of the amydala in emotion processing, that humour activated the amygdala more than happiness. As both stimuli have the same valence, the authors suggested that the arousal explained their results. Finally highly arousing stimuli such as sexual stimuli strongly activate the amygdala.  With the component process model, Sander et al. (2003) proposed that the amygdala implements evaluative processes related to the self-relevance of salient stimuli. According to this framework ‘the speciﬁcity and differentiation of emotion mostly relies upon the cognitive evaluation of the meaning and the consequences of a relevant external event within a speciﬁc context and relationship to one’s own goals’ (Sander et al., 2003). Self-relevance relates here to goals, needs, wellbeing and concerns. This could explain why amygdala response is preferential for some stimuli rather than others in speciﬁc contexts depending on the subject’s motivation. For instance response to food stimuli in the amygdala would increase if participants are hungry (Morris and Dolan, 2001). The selfrelevance model is also supported by the reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the orbital lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, regions implicated in the processing of value of stimuli (Miller and Cohen, 2001). The notion of relevance also helps to interpret individual differences in amygdala reactivity. Mood, personality trait, gender as well as genotype may modulate amygdala activity. Hariri et al. (2002) have shown that genes may inﬂuence the amygdala response to emotional negative faces. By studying a polymorphism of the serotonin– transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR), they showed that individuals carrying at least one S allele displayed greater amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli than individuals homozygous for the L allele. Using a self-referential task where people were judging if emotional positive or negative pictures are self-related (e.g. pictures connected to personal interests, relative or memories), Lemogne et al. (2011b) showed that cognitive, environmental and genetic factors interact to modulate the amygdala response. The amygdala activation during self-referential processing was negatively correlated with selfreported life-stress in short allele carriers and positively in individuals homozygous for the long allele, whereas an opposite pattern was observed during emotion labeling. These results conﬁrm that the inﬂuence of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on amygdala reactivity is at least partially under cognitive control.  3.3. Amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex and social cognition  The self-relevance framework may also predict amygdala response to speciﬁc categories of stimuli. Social stimuli and social events are particularly relevant and emotional  disorders, especially major depressive disorders, are clearly precipitated by major social life-events (Kendler et al., 2003). Recently, studies of the human mind and brain have begun to explore the biological basis of our social abilities (Adolphs, 1999). Cortico-limbic regions that process emotional stimuli are involved in processing social stimuli. Indeed our emotional brain is a social brain.  The amygdala is sensitive to social signal such as faces, gaze direction, intention, and trustworthiness (Adolphs, 2010). Likewise, patients with amygdala lesions showed not only abnormal fear response but also impaired social behaviors. Amygdala lesions are associated with increased social approach and difﬁculties in monitoring interpersonal distance (Kennedy et al., 2009). These abnormal social behaviors bear some resemblance to behaviors observed with experimentally induced Kl¨uver-Bucy syndrome in primates (Mason et al., 2006). We can also speculate that impaired processing of interpersonal distance in patients with autistic disorders or social phobia may reﬂect an exaggerated response of the amygdala to social signals.  One brain region is particularly devoted to the processing of emotional and social stimuli, namely the medial prefrontal cortex. The medial prefrontal is composed of a ventral (VMPFC) and a dorsal part (DMPFC). Ventromedial areas of the prefrontal cortex comprise the medial orbital frontal cortex, the MPCC and the ventral and rostral anterior cingulate. They are densely connected with the amygdala and subcortical structures (ventral striatum). There are also connections between the VMPFC, and the dorsal anterior cingulate, the DMPFC, the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These connections links medial regions implicated in emotion processing and lateral and dorsal prefrontal regions implicated in executive functions (Phillips et al., 2003).  Work by our group has emphasized the role of the VMPFC and DMPFC in self-referential processing and self-representation (Fossati et al., 2003, 2004; Lemogne et al., 2011a). The VMPFC cortex is associated with more automatic processing of self-relevant stimuli, whereas the DMPFC engaged more cognitive resources and introspective processes (i.e. self-reﬂection; Schmitz and Johnson, 2007).  The activation of medial prefrontal regions may also result from cognitive processes that are not self-speciﬁc. For instance, the dorsal part of MPFC is involved in tasks related to ‘theory of mind’ or ‘mentalizing’ which refers to the abilities to infer mental states of others (Adolphs, 2009). The ventral and dorsal MPFC are core components of the Default Mode Network (DMN) a network identiﬁed from resting state studies and from cognitively simple baseline tasks compared to more demanding experimental tasks. The DMN encompasses several cortical areas including the MPFC, precuneus, anterior cingulate cortices and posterior cingulated. Recently using an innovative design with a motor imitation paradigm, we observed that social interaction induces increased deactivation of the DMN, consistent with a role of medial prefrontal regions of the brain in the processing of social stimuli (Guionnet et al., in press).  Somerville et al. (2006) investigated human anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) involvement during a task where subjects make social judgment and receive ﬁctitious positive or negative feedback consistent or inconsistent with their expectations. The results demonstrated that the  S490  P. Fossati  ventral ACC was differentially responsive to social feedback. In a post hoc analysis, they additionally indicated that self-esteem modulates the ventromedial prefrontal cortex response to social feedback (Somerville et al., 2010). Using a similar paradigm in young people with major depression, Davey et al. (2011) found an increased amygdala activation in young people with major depression in response to social disapproval. MDD patients experienced heightened sensitivity to positive social signal indicating a non-speciﬁc arousal to social stimuli that were misinterpreted as aversive.  4. Discussion  We have brieﬂy reviewed the role of the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex in emotion processing. Beyond the classical contribution of the amygdala to fear processing, our review suggests a more general role for this structure. The amygdala contributes to the cognitive appraisal of salient stimuli and the detection of personally relevant stimuli. Although the amygdala is a key player, the strong and reciprocal connections between this structure and cortical and subcortical regions call for the integration of a larger brain network in the detection of self-relevance and in processing the value of stimuli. Among these regions we have discussed the role of the medial prefrontal cortex in self-referential processing and social interaction. It is beyond the scope of this review to consider other regions such as the hippocampus or lateral prefrontal cortex. Due to its role in spatial cognition and autobiographical memory, the hippocampus may play a role in the contextualization of emotion. Lateral prefrontal cortex functions are related to cognitive control of emotion (Ochsner and Gross, 2005). Dorsolateral prefrontal and ventrolateral cortex by deﬁning priorities according to the goal of the subjects may control the responses of medial prefrontal regions and the amygdala. Dysfunctions of these control processes contribute to rumination in major depression, a symptom associated with increased self-focus and abnormal self-relevance of internal stimuli.  We have also emphasized the role of the medial prefrontal cortex in self-processing. The role of the medial prefrontal cortex is not limited to self-referential processing and many authors have identiﬁed the human ventromedial prefrontal cortex as a key region for several functions: autobiographical memory, fear extinction, economic valuation (Roy et al., 2012).  Finally, we did not discuss the role of the mirror neuron system (MNS) in social cognition and the interaction between the MNS, medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. There is a common distinction in the literature between physical and evaluative aspects of the self. MNS and CMS are responsible, at different cognitive levels, for self-other mapping of physical actions and mental states, respectively. The connections between these two networks facilitate integration of information necessary for maintaining self– other representations across multiple domains (Uddin et al., 2007) in relation to emotion processing.  5. Conclusion  Social psychologists have long emphasized that emotion and cognitive processes are socially regulated. The overlap  between brain regions involved in emotion processing and in processing social stimuli underlines the need to adopt a socio-affective neuroscience perspective in the study of emotion. Applying this perspective in psychiatry is a promising and innovative development having the power to deﬁne new pathophysiological pathways and to yield functional biomarkers of mental disorders.

In patients, emotion recognition impairments were found to be paralleled by cerebral dysfunctions in the affective division of the anterior cingulate cortex, the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the right superior temporal gyrus and the right fusiform gyrus. While the patients' responses to emotional faces were characterized predominantly by hypoactivations, the neutral faces elicited hyperactivations mainly in the frontal and cingulate areas, and the basal ganglia, along with misattribution errors. The decreased activation in the fusiform face area during responses to both emotional and neutral stimuli may be indicative of general face processing deﬁcits. Similar although less pronounced deﬁcits have been observed in subjects at high risk of psychosis as well as in patients with early onset. In adult schizophrenia, the evidence of an imbalanced cerebral network appears early in the course of the illness, with the dysfunctions, as indicated by correlations here, becoming more pronounced in patients with longer illness duration.  © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.  1. Introduction  In schizophrenia, a range of abnormalities have been detected in the regions associated with face recognition and emotion processing. The reduction of gray matter volume in the superior temporal gyrus (coding facial expressions (Haxby et al., 2002)) has been shown to be associated with thought disorder (Barta et al., 1997; Shenton et al., 1992) and acoustic hallucinations (Barta et al., 1990; Gaser et al., 2004; Sumich et al., 2005). Structural MRI studies have demonstrated that the gray matter volume of the fusiform gyrus (coding facial identity (Haxby et al., 2002)) is reduced in ﬁrst  ⁎ Corresponding author.

The deactivation of the fusiform gyrus is associated with impaired face processing in subjects at risk of psychosis (Seiferth et al., 2009), and in juvenile (Seiferth et al., 2008) and adult patients (Quintana et al., 2003).  Neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia have demonstrated abnormalities in the amygdala and the hippocampus (Gur et al., 2002; Habel et al., 2004; Hempel et al., 2003; Holt et al., 2006; Kosaka et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 1998) – regions important for identiﬁcation of the emotional signiﬁcance of stimuli – and in the prefrontal cortex (Habel et al., 2004; Hempel et al., 2003) responsible for executive functions (Phillips et al., 2003).  The varied nature of the assigned tasks and the lack of consistency in the deﬁnition of emotional processing might have contributed to some of the divergent results yielded by previous studies assessing the dysfunctions in schizophrenia  114  U. Habel et al. / Schizophrenia Research 122 (2010) 113–123  and their neural correlates. Most studies have used passive viewing and implicit emotion processing tasks, requiring, for instance, simple emotion discrimination (e.g. Blair et al., 1999; Morris et al., 1998; Sprengelmeyer et al., 1998). In comparison to explicit tasks, those tasks (termed “implicit”) seem to reﬂect a less conscious level of emotional processing and entail different neural networks. Moreover, explicit and implicit tasks are not comparable in terms of requirements and processing load.  In the present study, our aim was to investigate the behavioral and neuronal responses of adult patients with schizophrenia and control subjects during an explicit facial– emotional discrimination task designed to distinguish between deﬁcits related to sensitivity (ability to name an emotion) and speciﬁcity (ability to discriminate between different emotional expressions and neutral faces). Unlike most previous studies on emotion recognition, the present study allowed us to distinguish between different emotional valences. Also, investigating brain responses to neutral faces, we sought to disclose any changes in the areas associated with facial processing. The event-related design of the task enabled us to characterize stimulus-related brain activation.  On a behavioral level, we expected to demonstrate, on the basis of our previous results, that in patients speciﬁcity is more affected than sensitivity. We hypothesized that in patients with schizophrenia emotion recognition impairments are accompanied by dysfunctions in the limbic system, the frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate, as these are regions heavily involved in emotion processing (and have been found, by many previous studies, to be affected in patients with schizophrenia). In addition, we aimed to locate affected areas reﬂecting general dysfunctions in emotional discrimination, independent of the emotional valence, as well as emotion-speciﬁc dysfunctions. Speciﬁcally, our study sought to identify altered functionality in the fusiform face area, conﬁrming the impairment in face perception in patients with schizophrenia. Based on our previous results with early onset and prodromal patients, we anticipated that the response to neutral faces would be qualitatively different from the one to emotional faces.  2. Patients and methods  2.1. Participants  Seventeen patients with schizophrenia were recruited from the Departments of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Universities of Aachen and Düsseldorf, Germany.  The diagnosis was ascertained by clinical psychologists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria using the German version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (Wittchen et al., 1996). Patients with any other comorbid psychiatric or neurological disorder were not included.  Twelve patients were medicated with atypical antipsychotics (four patients received risperidone, four olanzapine, two ziprasidone, one amisulpride, and one clozapine), two with typical antipsychotics (haloperidol) and two with a combination of both (chlorprothixene and olanzapine, or ﬂupentixole and amisulpride). One patient was unmedicated. Mean time since the ﬁrst clinical admission was 9.9 (±8.6) years (min/max: 1/30).  The control group comprised seventeen healthy subjects matched for age, gender and parental education (Table 1). All participants were right-handed (Oldﬁeld, 1971). The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee, and signed by all participants.  2.2. Stimuli  We applied a modiﬁed version of the Facial Emotions for Brain Activation (FEBA) test (Gur et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2006). The stimuli were selected from a standardized stimulus set, and the detailed task construction is reported elsewhere (Gur et al., 2002). The stimuli were made of colour photographs of faces (48 male, 48 female) – balanced according to age, sex and ethnicity – showing happy, sad, angry, fearful expressions or no emotion. After 4 runs, each face was seen by each subject exactly 5 times (4 emotional expressions and a neutral face).  2.3. FMRI paradigm  The event-related fMRI paradigm involved four randomly presented runs, in which one of the chosen emotions (fear, happiness, anger or sadness) was the target emotion. Hence the target emotion varied from run to run. Participants were instructed to answer by pressing a button with their left (target emotion) or right (non-target emotion or neutral face) index ﬁnger. The response hand was not counterbalanced across subjects. During the comparison of emotional conditions, the motor reaction was automatically omitted and, therefore, can be neglected. Each run was composed of 120 faces (32 targets, 32 emotional non-targets, and 56 neutral non-targets). Every stimulus was presented for 2 s with an interstimulus interval of 1 s (blank screen).  2.4. MRI data acquisition  Imaging was performed on a 1.5 Tesla Sonata MRI scanner (Siemens medical system, Erlangen, Germany) by means of an 8-channel headcoil. For fMRI, T2*-weighted echoplanar images (EPI, single shot pulse sequence, TR=3 s, ﬂip angle 90°) were taken parallel to the anterior/posterior commissural plane (30 slices, FoV 200×200 mm2, matrix 64×64, slice thickness 3 mm, 0.3 mm gap, voxel size 3.125×3.125×3 mm3). The fMRI session for emotion discrimination included 143 image volumes. A high resolution structural T1-weighted image (voxel size 1×1×1 mm3, sagittal FOV 256×256 mm2, 160 slices, TR=2.2 s, TE=4 ms, ﬂip angle=15°) was also obtained.  2.5. Analysis of behavioral data  The behavioral data were analysed by using SPSS 15 (SPSS Inc, 2006). Error probability was predeﬁned at α=0.05 (two tailed). Emotion discrimination performance was assessed by sensitivity (true positives/(true positives+false negatives)), speciﬁcity (true negatives/(true negatives+false positives)), and reaction time (RT; for both hits and correct rejections) for each emotional condition. True positives include all correct responses to targets, whereas the true negatives are deﬁned as correctly classiﬁed non-targets. False positives are the total number of responses when a non-target face was rated as a target, whereas false negatives are the number of targets falsely  U.

In order to compare patients and controls with respect to their sensitivity and speciﬁcity, we performed some additional exploratory analyses: First, we calculated the relative frequencies of true positive answers (TP) across the four target emotions and, accordingly, the relative frequencies of false positive answers (FP). To assess the relative contribution of neutral non-targets to the false positive rate, we restricted the analysis to the neutral stimuli (FP_n). According to signal-detection theory, relative frequencies were z-transformed in order to apply pair-wise comparisons by using ttests. Zero-frequencies were replaced by z-transforming (0.1)/ N (instead of 0/N), where N is the number of neutral stimuli. Comparisons between groups were performed for TP, FP and FP_n. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with the within-subject factor ‘emotion’ (happy, sad, angry, and fearful) and the between-subject factor ‘group’ (patients, healthy controls) were performed. Post-hoc analyses of signiﬁcant effects were carried out by t-tests (Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons). Socio-demographical, neuropsychological and psychopathological data were compared by two-sample t-tests.  2.6. FMRI analysis  2.6.1. Image preprocessing  Images were processed by means of the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5) software (Wellcome Dept. of Cognitive Neurology, 2003). The ﬁrst three images of each time series were excluded to account for T1-stabilization-effects. All remaining images were slice-time corrected and realigned to the ﬁrst image. The mean EPI volume of each session was estimated and coregistered with T1-weighted anatomical three dimensional image of each subject (Ashburner and Friston, 1997). Normalization parameters were determined for the anatomical images, which where coregistered to a standard T1-template (SPM5 distribution; linear and non-linear transformations, 5th degree spline interpolation to 2×2×2 mm3 resolution). These parameters were then applied to the coregistered functional timeseries, which was smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 10 mm full width at half maximum.  2.6.2. Statistical analysis  For fMRI, ﬁrst level models were deﬁned for each subject within the general linear model (GLM) framework of SPM5. For each event type delta functions of stimulus onset times were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, which were used as regressors in the GLM. Contrast images were generated for each condition vs. baseline (blank screen) and were included in a repeated-measures ANOVA on the 2nd level. This mixed two factorial design consisted of the within-subject factor facial emotion (with ﬁve levels: happy, sad, angry, fearful or neutral faces) and the between-subjects factor group (with two levels: patients and healthy controls). The 2nd level random effect analyses were performed using tcontrasts on the mixed-design ANOVA. Signiﬁcance level was set to p=0.001, uncorrected.  In patients, hypoactivation pertaining to emotion processing (independent of the speciﬁc emotion quality) was probed by means of a conjunction analysis, which was about the commonality of the four contrasts comparing controls with patients for each of the emotional conditions. Each single group comparison was thresholded at an uncorrected p-value of 0.01. Inference of this commonality was based on the conjunction null hypothesis (Nichols et al., 2005).  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral performance in emotion discrimination  In the analysis of speciﬁcity, a main effect for the factor group emerged (F=10.674, df=1/26, p=0.003), indicating a lower speciﬁcity for patients as compared to controls, whereas no group differences were observed in sensitivity. No group×emotion interaction was detected in either analysis (Fig. 1). Furthermore, within-group comparisons between FP and FP_n revealed that the healthy controls did not differ signiﬁcantly with respect to FP and FP_n (t=1.492, df=14, p=0.1580), whereas patients did (t=2.4387, df=14, p=0.0287), indicating that patients tend to ascribe emotions to neutral stimuli more than healthy controls do. Next, we show that patients misinterpreted the neutral faces as being angry (t=2.8977, df=27, p=0.0037) or fearful  116  U. Habel et al. / Schizophrenia Research 122 (2010) 113–123  Fig. 1.

Patients with stronger negative symptoms showed a stronger tendency to perceive neutral faces as emotional (r=0.58, p=0.0306). A negative correlation between speciﬁcity and the duration of illness was observed (r=−0.70, p=0.007) (Fig. 3). We also detected a positive correlation between the duration of illness and negative symptoms (r = 0.6019, p=0.0295).  Group differences were observed in RT for correct rejections (F = 5.85, df = 1/26, p b0.023). Patients revealed slower  responses when correctly rejecting non-targets (pb0.001) (see Fig. 2).  3.2.

The right superior temporal gyrus (STG), the right middle temporal gyrus and the left insula were also recruited less strongly by the patients. The same applied to the left hippocampus, the left parahippocampal gyrus and the right thalamus. Reduced activation was seen also in the right fusiform gyrus and in the occipital areas (Table 2), whereas the bilateral cuneus demonstrated increased activation (Table 2).  3.2.2. Response to sad faces  In patients, hypoactivation was seen in the bilateral ACC, the left DMPFC and the left VLPFC. Hypoactivation also emerged in  the right STG, the right middle temporal gyrus, the right fusiform gyrus and the right insula. The right caudate, the right thalamus und the bilateral cuneus (BA 17) were recruited to a lesser degree (Table 3). On the other hand, increased activation was detected in the right precentral gyrus, the right DLPFC, the bilateral cuneus (BA 18), right precuneus and the right putamen (Table 3).  3.2.3. Response to fearful faces  Compared to the control subjects, patients showed less activation in the right DMPFC, the right anterior cingulate and the bilateral cuneus (BA17) (Table 4).

In contrast, hypoactivations (in patients) were observed in the right fusiform gyrus, the bilateral cuneus (BA 17) and the superior temporal gyrus (Table 6; Fig. 4).  3.2.6. Group difference independent of emotional valence  The conjunction analysis demonstrated that in response to all presented emotions, patients showed less involvement of the rostral ACC, bilateral DMPFC, the right middle temporal gyrus and the right fusiform gyrus. The bilateral cuneus (BA 17, BA 18) was also recruited less strongly (Table 7; Fig. 6). Hyperactivations were detected in the right precentral gyrus (extending to the right inferior frontal gyrus), the right precuneus and the left cuneus (BA 19) (Table 7; Fig. 6).  4. Discussion  4.1. Speciﬁcity dysfunctions in emotion discrimination  Through our explicit emotion discrimination task (specially designed for in-depth characterization of emotion recognition deﬁcits in schizophrenia), we found patients to be impaired in their ability to correctly reject a non-target  emotion. While the ability to identify the target emotion was unaffected, patients showed a tendency to perceive the target emotion where it was not present. The error analysis revealed the patients' tendency to assign a negative emotion (fear or anger) to a neutral face. In patients with stronger negative symptoms, this tendency was more pronounced.  Further behavioral results indicate that individuals at high familial risk of schizophrenia (Eack et al., 2010), and patients with chronic schizophrenia, tend to consistently misinterpret neutral faces as negative (Kohler et al., 2003). On a cerebral level, in response to neutral faces, patients showed more activation in the prefrontal areas and in the middle orbital gyrus extending to the subgenual anterior cingulate (Fig. 5), the left cuneus, the right precuneus, the right parietal lobule, and the bilateral putamen. The hyperactivity in the emotionrelated brain regions in response to non-emotional information might be a consequence of aberrant attribution of emotional meaning to neutral stimuli. This observation is in line with the clinical phenomenology of schizophrenia. Negative attribution, cognitive biases, delusions and ideas of reference are related to the development of paranoia. There were detectable associations between negative symptoms and these behavioral results, which may be explained by the fact that the core negative symptoms are often associated  120  U.

Hyperactivation in areas closely related to cognitive functions may indicate compensatory or regulatory processes meant to counterbalance these inadequate emotional responses. Decreased activation in the fusiform face area and the right superior temporal gyrus during responses to neutral stimuli may, on the other hand, point to general face processing deﬁcits in schizophrenia (see Section 4.2).  Using the same emotion discrimination task, we found subjects clinically at risk of psychosis showing stronger activation (in response to neutral faces) in the inferior and superior frontal gyri and the cuneus (Seiferth et al., 2008), although no behavioral deﬁcits were detected. This is in consistence with the fact that cerebral dysfunctions appear to precede behavioral impairments. Furthermore, the present study found behavioral deﬁcits to be more pronounced in patients with longer illness duration, which indicates that while deﬁcits are already present at early stages, they seem to progress along a chronic illness course.  4.2. Valence-independent general cerebral dysfunctions  The emotion recognition impairment in patients is also characterized by reduced cerebral responses to emotional stimuli in the anterior cingulate, bilateral DMPFC, bilateral cuneus, and the temporal pole. The dysfunction in the affective division of the ACC (Bush et al., 2000) corresponds to a region attributed to person perception, mentalizing and self-knowledge (Amodio and Frith, 2006) as well as emotional functions.  U. Habel et al. / Schizophrenia Research 122 (2010) 113–123  121  Fig. 6. Main activation clusters (p b0.01, uncorrected) for the group contrast patients bcontrols in response to happy, sad, angry, and fearful expressions (conjunction analysis). (A) Glass brain image of the conjunction analysis. (B) Deactivation in patients in the affective division of the ACC (x=6 y=36 z =22), the DMPFC (x=2 y =32 z=34) and the cuneus (x=−2 y=102 z =−4). (C) Deactivation in patients in the fusiform gyrus (x=42 y=−48 z =−16).  This is also supported by the meta-analysis of Phan et al. (2002) in which prefrontal activation in response to different emotions and mood induction procedures has been found within the ventral–rostral (BA 9 and 10) area of the prefrontal cortex extending into the affective subdivision of the ACC (BA 24, 32, 33). The authors suggest that prefrontal activation may reﬂect the cognitive evaluative aspects (attention, awareness, and appraisal) characteristic of all emotions. The ACC, among other functions, was found to be typically involved during emotional tasks with cognitive demand. This also applies to our emotional categorization task. DMPFC is also associated with mentalizing (Lieberman, 2005). It demonstrates that in schizophrenia, the impairment of emotion recognition abilities might underlie deﬁcits in the social cognitive processes.  The right fusiform face area, which is highly specialized in identifying human faces (Tsao and Livingstone, 2008), was recruited less strongly by patients (compared to controls) in response to emotional faces. Impaired functions of the fusiform face area (Marwick and Hall, 2008) suggest that basic encoding deﬁcits may also underlie the impairment in emotion classiﬁcation abilities in patients with schizophrenia.  Regardless of the valence of the emotional stimuli, stronger activation was observed in patients in the precentral area, the right inferior frontal gyrus, the right precuneus and in the left cuneus. Notably, juvenile patients with schizophrenia showed similar hyperactivation during performance of the same task in response to all facial expressions except sadness (Seiferth et al., 2009). Hence, the deﬁcit seems to be quite stable and present  early in the illness course. The hyperactivation of those regions (especially the inferior frontal gyrus and the precuneus) is likely to be a result of compensatory processes triggered to counterbalance the deﬁcit in emotion recognition and face processing. Alternatively, this activation in cognition-related areas (the precentral area, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the precuneus) may indicate a greater cognitive effort in patients to perform the task.  4.3. Emotion-speciﬁc dysfunctions  Here, patients demonstrated hypoactivation in the VLPFC (in response to sad, happy and angry faces), in the insula (sad and happy faces) and in the thalamus (in response to happy and sad faces). Reduced activation was also observed in the hippocampus (in response to happy faces) and in the caudate (in response to sad faces). Also, the STG (in response to happy, sad and angry faces) and the parahippocampal gyrus (in response to happy and angry faces) were less strongly recruited.  These results further indicate valence modulated dysfunctions (in the patients' perception of social/emotional information), which are superimposed onto general dysfunctions. They also point to speciﬁc dysfunctions in patients while attending to a certain target emotion during the task. Given that most of these regions are speciﬁcally associated with emotion processing, the results of this study once again support the notion that these deﬁcits cannot be solely attributed to cognitive problems.  122  U. Habel et al. / Schizophrenia Research 122 (2010) 113–123  4.4. Limitations and conclusions  Our sample was heterogeneous with respect to gender, age of illness onset, chronicity, and medication. We were also unable to quantify potential medication effects, since most patients received second generation antipsychotics, and potential transformations to chlorpromazine equivalents are still not handled consistently in the literature. However, our ﬁndings are in line with results from preceding studies including juvenile patients (Seiferth et al., 2009) and subjects clinically at risk of psychosis (Seiferth et al., 2008) as well as studies investigating unmedicated patients (Paradiso et al., 2003). The illness speciﬁcity of these deﬁcits remains to be determined.  Dysfunctions in the neural circuits involved in face and emotion processing underlie the reduced speciﬁcity in emotion recognition, demonstrating that perceptual processing may already be affected. We conclude that patients tend to misread a neutral face as angry or fearful, indicating increased neural activation in emotion-related areas in response to neutral faces as well as reduced activation in response to emotional faces in areas related to emotion and face processing representing facets of social cognitive processes.

However, it is likely that other important dimensions for emotional neurocircuitry exist, and one of them is sociality. A social dimension may code whether emotions are addressing an individual’s biological/visceral need versus more remote social goals involving semantic meaning or intentionality. Thus, for practical purposes, social emotions may be distinguished from nonsocial emotions based in part on the presence of human forms. In the current fMRI study, we aimed to compare regional coding of the sociality dimension of emotion (nonsocial versus social) versus the valence dimension of emotion (positive versus negative). Using a novel fMRI paradigm, film and picture stimuli were combined to induce and maintain four emotions varying along social and valence dimensions. Nonsocial emotions of positively valenced appetite and negatively valenced disgust and social emotions of positively valenced joy/ amusement and negatively valenced sadness were studied. All conditions activated the thalamus. Appetite and disgust activated posterior insula and visual cortex, whereas joy/amusement and sadness activated extended amygdala, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate. Activations within the anterior cingulate, nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala were modulated by both social and valence dimensions. Overall, these findings highlight that sociality has a key role in processing emotional valence, which may have implications for patient populations with social and emotional deficits.

Common theories of emotion emphasize different dimensions (e.g., valence, arousal, approach/ withdrawal); however, given the obvious role of emotion in transacting social behavior, sociality may be another important dimension of emotional functioning. Along an affective valence dimension, positive and negative emotions occupy two ends of the spectrum. Emotions also can vary along a sociality dimension, varying between either nonsocial or social.  The sociality dimension may reflect the differences between basic biological drives (nonsocial) and complex social interaction (social), where the main difference relies on the presence of human forms interacting in cognitively complex ways involving language, meaning and social intentionality to activate the emotion. In the nonsocial domain, emotions often promote individual survival by directing immediate physiological and behavioral responses to biologically significant stimuli (Darwin, 1998) such as approach behavior to food or sexual stimuli and aversive/avoidance behavior including fighting or fleeing (Frijda, 1988). On the other hand, in the social domain, emotions are motivated to direct long-term social goals and are embedded in semantic and thematic meaning. Thus, nonsocial emotions (e.g., appetite/food desire and disgust) are often elicited by incentive or aversive stimuli that have direct physiological relevance, while social emotions (e.g., joy/humor and sadness) emerge in social interactions with other individuals and are typically embedded in structures of social relationship, intentionality, and meaning. Experimentally, stimuli aimed to trigger emotions in the social domain might rely on the presence or absence of human forms and figures, or depict social scenes to elicit emotions. Using a newly developed behavioral paradigm, we differentiated nonsocial and social emotions, as well as positive and negative emotions, based on subjective and psychophysiological responses. Four distinct response profiles for appetite, disgust, joy/amusement, and sadness indicated sociality influences emo 398  J.C. Britton et al. / NeuroImage 31 (2006) 397 – 409  tional responses, even to emotions of the same valence (Britton et al., in press). In this study, we asked whether sociality versus valence dimensions of emotion can be distinguished with neuroanatomical specificity?  Sociality includes processing human faces, understanding body language, and making inferences about the intentions of others; thus, it is not surprising that sociality may be processed by a dedicated network of brain regions including fusiform gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and posterior cingulate. Face processing has been associated with fusiform and superior temporal gyrus activation. Fusiform gyrus is involved in the perception and recognition of faces (Kanwisher et al., 1997) and processing emotional pictures with human forms and social interactions (Geday et al., 2003). Superior temporal gyrus is involved in understanding complex social signals in eye gaze, mouth movements, and body language (Grossman and Blake, 2002; Pelphrey et al., 2005; Puce et al., 2003). In addition, regions such as medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and posterior cingulate have been implicated in self-reflection and assessing others intentions. The medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in representing states of self versus others, theory of mind, and empathy (Frith and Frith, 2003; Kelley et al., 2002; Phan et al., 2004; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2004). The amygdala has been associated with processing general salience or meaningfulness of emotional stimuli (Liberzon et al., 2003) and, in particular, social salience evidenced by the deficits in recognizing social emotions and making trustworthiness judgments associated with amygdalar lesions (Adolphs et al., 1998, 2002). Posterior cingulate responded to self-reflection and judgments about others (Johnson et al., 2002; Ochsner et al., 2004). Even though these regions may process social features of stimuli, do these regions respond to social dimension of emotional stimuli, independent of valence?  Neuroimaging studies have identified key brain structures involved in processing appetite, disgust, joy, and sadness. For example, appetite ratings during food presentation have been reported to correlate with blood flow in the right posterior orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that reward processes are involved (Morris and Dolan, 2001). Humorous film clips have activated the nucleus accumbens (Mobbs et al., 2003; Moran et al., 2004). In addition, amygdala, commonly associated with fear processing (LeDoux, 1998), has been also implicated in processing of happy faces and positive stimuli (Breiter et al., 1996; Liberzon et al., 2003; Somerville et al., 2004). Disgust perception typically activates insular regions (Phillips et al., 1997; Sprengelmeyer et al., 1998), which are also associated with visceral functions, or socalled ‘‘gut reactions’’ (Critchley et al., 2000). Sadness has been associated with subcallosal cingulate (BA25) activation (Phan et al., 2002), and subcallosal cingulate hypometabolism has been reported in depressed patients (Drevets et al., 1997; Mayberg et al., 2000; Mayberg et al., 1999). Although the research on neuroanatomy of emotions (appetite, joy, disgust, and sadness) has been growing, only few studies have compared these emotions across valence (Lane et al., 1997a,b), and in particular, the sociality dimension has been relatively neglected.  To examine whether sociality modulates brain coding of valenced emotions, we used a novel behavioral paradigm, combining film to induce particular emotions and static picture stimuli to maintain those emotions under appropriate conditions for neuroimaging studies (Britton et al., in press). In the current fMRI study, we aimed to (1) identify regions that are involved in processing the sociality dimension of emotions (i.e., regions  responsive to social emotions versus nonsocial emotions), (2) identify regions processing emotional valence (i.e., regions responsive to positive emotions versus negative emotions). We used a paradigm that aimed to manipulate sociality (nonsocial, social) and valence (positive, neutral, negative) as independent factors. Nonsocial conditions used images of physical stimuli, such as an appetizing pizza to elicit a nonsocial positively valenced emotion (appetite) and amputation procedures to elicit a nonsocial negatively valenced emotion (disgust). Social conditions had human actors in scripted situations featuring direct interpersonal engagement, using either humor to elicit a positively valenced social emotion (joy/amusement) or social bereavement to elicit a negatively valenced social emotion (sadness). We examined BOLD activation patterns for both main effects of sociality and valence and interactions effects between these two independent factors (sociality  valence). We hypothesized that regions would be more responsive to the social dimension (nonsocial: insula and hypothalamus, social: amygdala, superior temporal gyrus, fusiform, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex); whereas another set of regions may be more responsive to the valence dimension (positive: orbitofrontal cortex, positive/negative: nucleus accumbens, and negative: subgenual anterior cingulate). In addition, some regions may respond to the interaction between social and valence dimensions (e.g., nonsocial negative, disgust: insula).  Materials and methods  Participants  T  Twelve healthy volunteers (6 male, 6 female; age range 19 – 29 0.96 years) were recruited from advertiseyears, mean age 23.6 local universities. All participants were rightments placed at handed, English speaking and had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal hearing. Participants did not have a history of head injury, learning disability, psychiatric illness, or substance abuse/dependence (>6 months) assessed by Mini-SCID (Sheehan et al., 1998). After explanation of the experimental protocol, all participants gave written informed consent, as approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Participants were paid for their participation.  Apparatus  After completing a practice session, volunteers were placed comfortably within the scanner. A light restraint was used to limit head movement during acquisition. While lying inside the scanner, stimuli were presented to participants via a shielded LCD panel mounted on the RF head coil. From a laptop computer (Macintosh Powerbook), film segments were shown using QuickTime (Apple Computer, Inc.) and participants listened to each film using headphones. Picture and fixation segments were displayed using Eprime software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Schneider et al., 2002a,b). In addition, Eprime recorded participants’ subjective responses via right-handed button-glove.  Procedure  Short film segments (¨2 min) were shown to induce discrete emotional states. Immediately following each film, participants were asked to maintain the emotion evoked for a 30-s period, while  J.C. Britton et al. / NeuroImage 31 (2006) 397 – 409  399  ten static frames extracted from the previous film were shown in a chronological sequence. Each frame/picture was shown for 3 s with no interstimulus interval. Following the static pictures, another 30s period of control images (i.e., gray screens with a central fixation cross matched with equivalent brightness as the preceding picture segment) was viewed to control for visual properties of the stimulus and scanner drift across conditions. Subjective ratings were obtained following each film – picture pair by showing a series of adjectives. fMRI acquisition coincided with the 60-s picture presentation period (Fig. 1).  Stimuli  To dissociate emotions, stimuli varied in sociality (nonsocial, social) and valence (positive, neutral, negative). Nonsocial stimuli included footage from a pizza commercial (Pizza Hut, Inc.) to induce appetite in the sense of a positive urge to eat and footage of wounded bodies, amputation procedures and burn victims (Gross and Levenson, 1995) to induce bodily disgust. Social stimuli included stand-up comedy routines from Robin Williams (An Evening with Robin Williams, 1982) to induce humor and movie clips of poignant bereavement scenes from Steel Magnolias (Columbia/Tristar Studios, 1989) and The Champ (Warner Home Video, 1979) to induce sadness. To control for human forms and figures in nonsocial and social situations, nonemotional/neutral stimuli were viewed. These nonemotional/neutral stimuli included clips from home-improvement films of deck building, vinyl flooring, chair caning, and jewelry making (Do-ItYourself, 1985; IBEX, 1990; Nelson et al., 1991; TauntonPress, 1993). Two variants of each stimulus condition were shown.  To avoid carry over effects, similarly valenced blocks were viewed in succession. Positive, joy/amusement and pizza, stimuli were shown sequentially, and negative, disgust and sadness, stimuli were shown sequentially. The two variants of each stimulus were also shown in blocked fashion. The order of sociality (social, nonsocial), order of valenced blocks (positive, neutral, negative), and two variants of each stimuli were counterbalanced across subjects. Each valenced block was flanked by a blank stimulus condition, consisting of a series of gray fixation screens. No film was shown before the blank stimulus condition.  Measures  On-task performance  To monitor task performance during scan acquisition, participants were instructed to respond via button press using the right index finger when a new image appeared on the screen. The reaction time of this response was recorded.  Subjective response  Subjective responses were obtained after each film – picture pair to verify that the target emotional state was elicited. A series of adjectives were displayed on the screen one at a time. On a 1 – 5 scale (‘‘1’’ = not at all, ‘‘5’’ = extremely), participants rated, via button-press, the extent each adjective described their emotional experience during the preceding stimulus presentation. The adjective list included words such as hungry, desire, disgusted, happy, joyful, sad, depressed, upset, relaxed, and interested. The ratings of several descriptors were averaged together to represent four emotion rating types corresponding to each condition (joy/ amusement for social positive, sadness for social negative, appetite for nonsocial positive, and disgust for nonsocial negative). In addition, ratings of relaxed were used to measure subjective arousal. Similarly, baseline mood was measured prior to the induction procedure to assess their current emotional state upon entering the study.  fMRI image acquisition  Scanning was performed on a 3.0-T GE Signa System (Milwaukee, WI) using a standard radio frequency coil. A T1weighted image was acquired for landmark identification to position subsequent scans. After initial acquisition of T1 structural images, functional images were acquired. To minimize susceptibility artifact (Yang et al., 2002), whole-brain functional scans were acquired using T2*-weighted reverse spiral sequence with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast (echo time/TE = 30 ms, repetition time/TR of 2000 ms, frequency of 64 frames, flip angle of 80 , field of view/FOV of 20 cm, 40 contiguous 3 mm oblique axial slices/TR approximately parallel to the AC – PC line). Each functional run corresponded to one condition (nonsocial positive, nonsocial neutral, nonsocial negative, social positive, social neutral, social negative or blank). Each run began with 6 F dummy volumes (subsequently discarded) to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Functional acquisition corresponded to the picture and control images, i.e., scan acquisition did not occur during film segment viewing or during subjective ratings. Thus, each functional run corresponded to 60 s of acquisition or 30 TR volumes (15 volumes per picture segment, 15 volumes per control segment). Two variants of each condition were acquired. After 16 functional runs were collected, a high-resolution T1 scan was also acquired to provide precise anatomical localization (3D-SPGR, TR of 35 ms, min TE, flip angle of 35 , FOVof 24 cm, slice thickness of 2.5 cm, 60 slices/TR). Coimages were reconstructed off-line using the gridding approach into a 128  128 display matrix with an effective spatial resolution of 3 mm isotropic voxels.  _  Fig. 1. Time line of events. The sequence of events included (1) a film segment to induce discrete emotional states, (2) static pictures to maintain the emotional state, (3) luminance-matched fixation screens to control for visual properties and scanner drift, (4) a series of adjectives to obtain subjective ratings. fMRI acquisition coincided with the 60-s picture presentation period.  400  J.C. Britton et al. / NeuroImage 31 (2006) 397 – 409  Statistical analyses  Behavioral data  To test on-task performance during fMRI acquisition,  the accuracy in responding to the images (i.e., identifying a new image appeared) and the reaction time of a response were examined. The accuracy of response to both picture and control images was examined in a two-tailed paired t test. The reaction times were examined using 2 (modality: picture, control image)  2 (sociality: nonsocial, social)  3 (valence: positive, neutral, and negative) repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc analysis. The subjective response data were examined using a 2 (sociality: social, nonsocial)  3 (valence: positive, neutral, and negative)  4 (emotion rating type: appetite, disgust, joy, and sadness) repeated measures ANOVA. Post hoc analysis determined significant changes in subjective response within each condition (social positive – comedy routines, social negative – bereavement scenes, nonsocial positive – pizza scenes, nonsocial negative – wounded bodies). Paired t tests were used to determine significant changes in subjective ratings in each emotional condition as compared to the appropriate neutral condition, which controlled for the effect of human forms and figures. Nonsocial positive and nonsocial negative conditions were compared to nonsocial neutral conditions. Social positive and social negative conditions were compared to social neutral condition. One-factor (emotion rating type: appetite, disgust, joy, and sadness ratings) repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc analysis tested whether the targeted emotion was elicited selectively during each respective condition. In addition, paired t tests were used to directly compare subjective ratings of arousal between social and nonsocial dimensions within each valence type.  fMRI data analysis  Images were slice-time corrected,  realigned, coregistered, normalized, and smoothed according to standard methods. Scans were slice-time corrected using sinc interpolation of the eight nearest neighbors in the time series (Oppenheim and Schafer, 1989) and realigned to the first acquired volume using AIR 3.08 routines (Woods et al., 1998). Additional preprocessing and image analysis of the BOLD signal were performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM99; Wellcome Institute of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK; www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) implemented in MATLAB (Mathworks, Sherborn, MA). Images were coregistered with the high-resolution SPGR T1 image. This highresolution image was then spatially normalized, and transformation parameters were then applied to the coregistered functional volumes, resliced, and spatially smoothed by an isotropic 6 mm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel to minimize noise and residual differences in gyral anatomy. Each normalized image set was band pass filtered (high pass filter = 100 s) (Ashburner et al., 1997; Friston et al., 1995) and analyzed using a general linear model with parameters corresponding to run and stimuli type (emotional pictures and control images). Each stimulus block was convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF).  For each participant, parameter estimates of block-related activity were obtained at each voxel within the brain. Contrast images were calculated by applying appropriate linear contrasts to the parameter estimates of each block to produce statistical parametric maps of statistic (SPM{t}), which were transformed to a normal distribution (SPM{Z}). Since each run  the t  of the scanner included only a single condition and we were interested in comparisons between conditions, it was necessary to control for differences in signal intensity occurring between runs. To do so, we subtracted the 30-s control period from the 30-s maintenance period. All subsequent contrasts compared this maintenance – control difference between conditions. Using the appropriate neutral as the reference condition, relevant linear contrasts included valence main effects (e.g., positive: [social positive + nonsocial positive]   [social neutral + nonsocial [social neutral]) and ‘‘sociality’’ main effects (e.g., social: positive + social negative]   [social neutral]), and valence  sociality interaction effects. To account inter-individual variability, an additional 6-mm smoothing on the contrast images before incorporating the individual contrasts in a random effect analysis.  for  interest,  A second-level random effects analysis used one-sample t tests on smoothed contrast images obtained in each subject for each comparison of treating subjects as a random variable (Friston, 1998). This analysis estimates the error variance for each condition of interest across subjects, rather than across scans, and therefore provides a stronger generalization to the population from which data are acquired. In this random effect analysis, resulting SPMs (df = 11) were examined in a priori regions of interest known to be involved in emotion processing, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate (ACC), posterior cingulate (PCC), insula, amygdala, sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA), hippocampus, nucleus accumbens (NAC). Whole-brain analysis conducts comparisons in a voxel-wise manner, increasing the possibility of false positives unless an appropriate correction for multiple comparisons is used. To restrict the number of comparisons, a Small Volume Correction (SVC) also was applied for all activations in a priori regions. SVC was implemented in SPM across three volumes of interest [rectangular box 1: x = 0 70 mm, y =  10 25 mm, rectangular box 2: x = T 45 mm, rectangular box 0 3: x = 0 30 mm]. Within each SVC, a false discovery rate [FDR] correction of 0.005 was used to ensure that on average no more than 0.5% of activated voxels for each contrast are expected to be false positive results (Genovese et al., 2002). In addition, a cluster size/extent threshold of greater than 5 contiguous voxels was used.  20 mm, y =  35  20 mm, y =  40  30 mm, z =  30  30 mm, z =  5  35 mm, z = 15  T  T  T  T  T  T  T  T  Results  On-task performance  Using reaction time as a measure, participants were on-task during the experiment.

Nonsocial emotions activated insula and visual cortex (Table 2), while social emotions activated the thalamus, amygdala/SLEA, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate (Table 3). Insula, visual cortex, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activated more during nonsocial emotional stimuli compared to social emotional stimuli; whereas the superior temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens activate more during social emotional stimuli than nonsocial emotional stimuli (Table 4).  37.9 ms) [valence effect: F(2,10) = 3.503, P < 0.048]. No interaction effects were detected (P > 0.684).  Nonsocial emotions  Subjective response  The targeted emotion was elicited by each film – picture condition as intended, and each of the conditions elicited appropriate valenced emotional ratings (Fig. 2). In subjective ratings, a significant sociality  valence  emotion rating type interaction [F(6,54) = 7.815, P < 0.001] was detected, prompting further post hoc analysis. Nonsocial positive, pizza, stimuli elicited the target emotion (appetite) more than nontarget emotions (disgust, joy/amusement, sadness). Specifically, pizza scenes elicited appetite [t(11) = 4.039, P < 0.002] and joyful ratings [t(11) = 2.532, P < 0.028]. A trend towards significant difference was detected between appetite, the target emotion, and happy/joy, the positive nontarget emotion [pairwise comparison: P < 0.113]. Social positive, comedy, stimuli elicited the target emotion (joy/ amusement) more than nontarget emotions (sadness, appetite, disgust). Comedy routines elicited joy [t(11) = 3.324, P < 0.007], while nontarget emotions were unchanged. Nonsocial negative, amputation, stimuli elicited the target emotion (disgust) more than nontarget emotions (appetite, joy/amusement, sadness). Wounded bodies elicited disgust [t(11) = 5.026, P < 0.001] and sadness [t(10) = 4.640, P < 0.001] and decreased joy [t(11) =  2.264, P < 0.045]. A trend towards significant difference was detected between disgust, the target emotion, and sadness, the negative nontarget emotion [pairwise comparison: P < 0.131]. Similarly, social negative, bereavement, stimuli elicited the target emotion (sadness) more than nontarget emotions (joy/amusement, appetite, disgust). Bereavement scenes elicited both sadness [t(11) = 3.006, P < 0.012] and disgust ratings [t(11) = 3.684, P < 0.004] and decreased joy ratings [t(11) =  4.011, P < 0.002]; however, no significant difference between target and negative nontarget ratings was detected. This pattern of subjective ratings is consistent with our previous behavioral study; however, in that larger sample (n = 40), all conditions elicited the target emotion significantly more than all nontarget emotions (Britton et al., in press).  Nonsocial and social neutral stimuli did not differ from blank on any rating (minimum t(11) = 0.488, P > 0.635, maximum t(11) = 1.365, P > 0.137). In addition, nonsocial neutral conditions did not differ from social neutral conditions (minimum t(11) =  0.2, P > 0.845, maximum t(11) = 1.483, P > 0.166). Finally, arousal ratings in social and nonsocial conditions did not significantly differ for any valence [positive: t(11) = 0.000, P > 1.000, neutral: t(10) = 1.614, P > 0.138, negative: t(10) = 0.796, P > 0.796].  Appetite (positive) and disgust (negative). Both nonsocial positive and nonsocial negative stimuli activated thalamus; however, the thalamic activation in the nonsocial negative condition was detected at a subthreshold cluster level [(6,  6, 0), Z = 2.76, k = 4].

Nonsocial appetizing pizza also activated anterior cingulate cortex, and nonsocial disgusting wounds also activated amygdala. Social emotions, joy and sadness, activated amygdala/sublenticular extended amygdala, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate. Positive social joy/amusement also activated reward-associated structures, orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Negative social sadness also activated anterior cingulate cortex. Thus, both sociality and valence exerted powerful effects on brain activation, with some activations related distinctly to a particular social or valence dimension, and other activation patterns jumping complexly across dimensions (for example, anterior cingulate activated by social negative and by nonsocial  positive emotion). Finally, all emotions activated the thalamus regardless of valence or sociality. Behavioral results confirmed ontask performance, and subjective responses indicated that the manipulation elicited targeted emotions.  that  Our findings suggest  the social dimension of emotion may be as neurobiologically distinct and meaningful as the dimension of valence. As Fig. 5 graphically depicts, positive and negative stimuli activated similar networks; however, in a number of regions, sociality determined more powerfully than valence which brain regions were activated. In addition, some regions responded to specific emotions that appeared to code a complex interaction between positive/negative valence and sociality dimension.  Fig. 3. Differential activation patterns to nonsocial and social emotions. Nonsocial dimension of emotion activates thalamus (Tha), insula (Ins), visual cortex (Vis). Positively valenced nonsocial emotion also activates anterior cingulate (ACC). Negatively valenced nonsocial emotion also activates amygdala (Amy). Social dimension of emotion activates thalamus, amygdala/sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA), hippocampus (Hipp), posterior cingulate (PCC), and superior temporal gyrus (STG). Positively valenced social emotion also activates nucleus accumbens (NAC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Negatively valenced social emotion also activates anterior cingulate.

SPM t maps show greater insula activation in nonsocial emotions [positive: ( 39,  9, 12), Z = 3.30, [k] = 18 and (54,  15, 15), Z = 3.34, [k] = 8, negative: (33, 18, 0), Z = 3.45, [k] = 8] and greater amygdala activation in social emotions [positive: (30,  3,  15), Z = 3.20, k = 8, negative: (15,  9,  18), Z = 3.50, [k] = 16]. Display threshold: P < 0.005, uncorrected, [k]  5 voxels. Note: Each set of figures has a different significance scale indicated by T value legend.  Nonsocial  Nonsocial emotions particularly activated regions involved in visceral response. Insular cortex activation to nonsocial emotions is consistent of responses involving monitoring of autonomic changes to maintain homeostasis (Reiman et al., 1997). For example, the insula responds to the interoceptive awareness of one’s own heartbeat (Critchley et al., 2004). In addition, insula may monitor emotional awareness (Craig, 2003).  Since the insula serves as an extension of the gustatory cortex and perceives pain information, it is not surprising that the insula captures the visceral response to appetizing pizza and to bodily disgust (Augustine, 1996). With respect to positive valence, insula responds to food and gustatory stimuli (Craig, 2003; LaBar et al.,  Fig. 5. Social dimension of emotion may be as neurobiologically distinct and meaningful as the dimension of valence. (A) Positive and negative dimensions of emotion activate a similar emotion network; however, little overlap exists along the social dimension within each valence. This emotional network includes thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate (ACC), hippocampus, amygdala (Amy), sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA), superior temporal gyrus (STG), posterior cingulate (PCC), and visual cortex. In addition, positive conditions activate the nucleus accumbens (NAC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). (B) Differential activation patterns correspond to social dimensions of emotion. Both nonsocial and social emotions activated the thalamus. Nonsocial positive and nonsocial negative emotions activate insula and visual cortex. In addition, ACC activates to nonsocial positive emotions and amygdala activates to nonsocial negative emotions. Social positive and social negative emotions activate amygdala/ sublenticular extended amygdala, hippocampus, superior temporal gyrus, and posterior cingulate. In addition, nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex respond to social positive emotions and ACC respond to social negative emotions. Note: Regions in italics were activated at a subthreshold cluster level, k = 4.  2001; Pelchat et al., 2004) and is activated during hunger and satiated states (Hinton et al., 2004; LaBar et al., 2001). Anterior insula has been reported to be associated especially with hunger, while posterior insula has been associated with satiety (Morris and Dolan, 2001). In this study, a more posterior insular region was activated by the appetizing pizza stimulus, which elicited increased hunger ratings, although the participants had not actually been fasted or deprived of food. With respect to negative valence, the insula also has been implicated in disgust and pain.

Britton et al. / NeuroImage 31 (2006) 397 – 409  405  impair disgust recognition (Calder et al., 2000), and functional studies have found insula activations to unpleasant odors (Anderson et al., 2003), disgust pictures (Wright et al., 2004), disgust faces (Phillips et al., 1997), and self-induced disgust (Fitzgerald et al., 2004). Thus, one possibility is that insula activation in our participants may have reflected somatic responses triggered by appetizing and disgusting stimuli. These results are also consistent with greater insular activation found in response to nonsocial negative pictures compared to socially moral pictures (Moll et al., 2002).  This study detected insula activation in nonsocial conditions but not in social conditions; although other studies on amusement and sadness have detected insula activation. For example, those studies have found humor appreciation of films (Moran et al., 2004) and personal recall of a negative event to activate the anterior insula (Lane et al., 1997a,b; Reiman et al., 1997). In this study, however, the emotions of amusement and sadness were externally generated and maintained, which may have made a difference if the inclusion of a maintenance period reduced recruitment of insula activation. That possibility is consistent with findings that internally generated emotion activates the anterior insula more robustly than externally generated emotion (Reiman et al., 1997). In addition, those other studies activated a different region of the insula, anterior insula; whereas our study reports activation of posterior insula, a region thought in nonsocial conditions (Augustine, 1996). Thus, the discrepancies in insula activation across studies may be due to partly differences in internally versus externally generated emotion and in regional location within insula cortex.  to be involved in visceral  responses,  Nonsocial stimuli also preferentially activated visual cortex, possibly reflecting heightened attention related to motivation in response to the appetizing pizza and disgusting images. Increased activation in the visual cortex may reflect the stimulus’ significance to organism (Anderson and Phelps, 2001; Pessoa et al., 2002) or increased attention (Lane et al., 1999). Recently, other investigators also have found that appetizing food stimuli activate the visual cortex (Simmons et al., 2005). Negative disgust facial expressions and immediate threat are reported to elicit increased extrastriate visual cortical activation (Bradley et al., 2003; Simmons et al., 2005).  Amygdala was activated by disgust in this study. Although it is most notably associated with fear (LeDoux, 1998), the amygdala responds to other emotional stimuli including disgust pictures (LeDoux, 1998; Liberzon et al., 2003; Stark et al., 2003; Whalen et al., 1998). In some studies, insula and amygdala activations have been detected using disgust and fearful faces, where insular activation preferentially responded to disgust faces and amygdalar activation preferentially responded to fearful faces (Phillips et al., 1997). It is also possible that the amygdala activation to wounded bodies reflects more nonspecific emotional response similar to that seen with horror films, a combination of innate fear (another nonsocial negative emotion) and disgust.  Social  Amygdala/sublenticular extended amygdala was activated to social positive and negative conditions. This result is consistent with our previous findings that this region is involved in processing emotional salience (Liberzon et al., 2003). Amygdala/SLEA responds to salient properties of emotional stimuli, and faces are highly salient cues, given their importance in conveying  social meaning (Adolphs et al., 2002; Davis and Whalen, 2001). In addition, it is not surprising that social negative conditions activated more significantly, given the amygdala’s preferential involvement in processing negative emotions. Given the findings, the amygdala/sublenticular extended amygdala may preferentially respond to salient emotional properties that are specifically social.  thus,  its preferential  Social emotions of joy and sadness also activated the superior temporal gyrus. This region has been associated with processing facial features and with paying attention to facial expressions (Narumoto et al., 2001); in processing of social emotions in our study is not surprising. The activation in the superior temporal gyrus reflects the emotional processing demands beyond those required to process facial features, which were isolated by using a nonemotional neutral comparison controlling for human figures. In concert with our findings, this region is also associated with social cognition— social schema, perceptions of social signs, and the mental states of others (Adolphs, 1999; Haxby et al., 2000).  involvement  The activations in hippocampus and posterior cingulate may reflect memory processing. The hippocampus is involved in memory retrieval (Stark and Squire, 2001), and the posterior cingulate responds to the interaction between emotion and episodic memory (Maddock, 1999). One participant reported recognizing the social negative video, Steel Magnolias, and another reported personal memories associated with the social neutral video, deckmaking. Thus, the social stimuli presented in our study may have triggered individual’s memories and personal reflection (i.e., remembering personal accounts associated the comedy routine and/or remembering personal accounts associated with death), which may account for the hippocampus and poster cingulate activation (Addis et al., 2004; Gilboa et al., 2004).  if not  impossible,  To mediate some social interactions, self-referential processing may be engaged. For instance, social emotional processing may require relating/distinguishing the ‘‘self’’ and the ‘‘other’’. The interplay of these constructs is difficult, to disentangle; however, it is an important feature of sociality. Studies have suggested that the amygdala plays a role in stimulus salience, assessing the meaningfulness of stimuli (Liberzon et al., 2003). In addition, the amygdala has also been shown to detect racial outgroup status, suggesting that the amygdala detects a social ‘‘other’’(Hart et al., 2000). Several studies have investigated ‘‘self’’ processing through autobiographical memory (Cabeza et al., 2004; Levine et al., 2004), self-association tasks (Phan et al., 2004), and self-related judgments (Johnson et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2002). Those studies of self-referential processing have implicated the posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. The posterior cingulate activates with self-generated emotions (Damasio et al., 2000), listening to autobiographical scripts (Fink et al., 1996) and viewing personally familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2004). Interestingly, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation was not detected in social or nonsocial conditions. The mPFC has been shown to be activated during explicit self-association task and modulated in part by self-relevance. On the other hand, mPFC deactivates when making judgments pertaining to ‘‘other’’, showing less deactivation with self-related processing (Johnson et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2002). In our study, participants were not directly asked to make personal judgments or personal associations during the emotional task; thus, the failure to find dMPFC may not be surprising as dmPFC is activated with cognitive task (Taylor et al., 2003). According to meta-analysis, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is  406  J.C. Britton et al. / NeuroImage 31 (2006) 397 – 409  to be involved in general emotional processing (e.g., thought emotional evaluation/appraisal and emotion regulation); thus, it is assumed that these general emotional processes were present in all conditions. In fact at a lower threshold (FDR of 0.05), dmPFC was detected in all conditions. Thus, these regions that process social emotions may be processing the dynamic process of assessing selfrelevance in the social interactions presented.  Specific emotions  Anterior cingulate was activated by nonsocial appetite and social sadness but not by the other two emotions. In the case of appetite, anterior cingulate activation may aid in the generation of visceral responses, evidenced by correlations with cardiovascular and skin conductance responses (Critchley et al., 2000, 2001, 2005). In addition, the anterior cingulate activation could reflect attentional control, inhibition of a prepotent response, or conflict monitoring (Devinsky et al., 1995). Attention tasks such as the modified Stroop or dot-probe tasks have shown increased attention to food words in healthy and eating disorder participants (Channon et al., 1988; Mogg et al., 1998), suggesting a heightened salience or increased conflict, internal or otherwise, to the food cues. Anterior cingulate activation was also observed in induction of social sadness. Other studies have reported that sadness activates the anterior cingulate (Prohovnik et al., 2004). However, in this case, a lack of rostral anterior cingulate (BA25) activation is somewhat surprising since sadness induction studies typically activate this region (Mayberg et al., 1999; Phan et al., 2002). In the current study, dorsal anterior cingulate, typically activated in cognitive tasks, was activated rather than a more rostral region of the anterior cingulate, typically activated in emotional tasks (Bush et al., 2000). Conceivably sadness could have had less self-relevance and more cognitive processing (Reiman et al., 1997), though this interpretation is clearly speculative. For example, anterior cingulate activation may reflect participants distancing themselves from the bereavement scenes to avoid becoming overly sad.  Regions involved in reward processing have been reported to respond to positive valence, and we observed activation of these regions with social positive emotion. Specifically, orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens are associated with positive motivational significance (Berridge, 1996; Kelley, 2004; O’Doherty et al., 2000; Rolls, 2000; Rolls and Baylis, 1994). Orbitofrontal cortical activation has also been associated with appraising social – emotional stimuli and guiding goal-directed behavior (Bechara et al., 2000; Damasio et al., 2000) and with response to the valence of odors (Anderson et al., 2003). Basal ganglia activation including the ventral striatum has been reported in 70% of happiness induction studies (Phan et al., 2002), including pleasant pictures (Lane et al., 1997a,b), happy faces (Morris et al., 1996; Whalen et al., 1998), and happiness recall (George et al., 1996; Phan et al., 2002). In previous studies, orbitofrontal cortex activation has been detected when viewing food stimuli (Rolls and Baylis, 1994) and correlated with hunger ratings (Morris and Dolan, 2001). In our study, it is not entirely clear why appetizing pizza failed to activate nucleus accumbens or orbitofrontal cortex. This difference in response to social and visceral rewards might reflect a difference between obtained reward and anticipated reward. (Knutson et al., 2001). In this case, the comedy routine seems to be an immediate rewarding experience for participants; whereas the pizza scenes  it might  if the pizza image was not sufficiently potent  may not be directly rewarding since food was not tasted (Arana reflect an intensity et al., 2003). Alternatively, difference, to activate reward circuitry. Our participants were not required to fast prior to this study, which may have diminished the motivational salience of the pizza scenes (Critchley and Rolls, 1996; Wang et al., 2004), and no odor or sight of real pizza was presented here. Future studies could explore the role of these factors in determining activation of orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens.  General findings  All the stimuli used in this study activated the thalamus, a central sensory gateway. Prior work from other groups using positive and negative IAPS pictures to elicit emotional responses also reported activation of the thalamus (Lane et al., 1997b). Similarly, other emotion activation paradigms that used film and script-driven recall to induce happy, sad, and disgust also elicited thalamic activation (Lane et al., 1997a).  Several limitations of this study should be noted. In trying to underscore the importance of characterizing emotions based on a social dimension, this design contrasted two important factors, a social dimension (social, nonsocial) and a valence dimension (positive, negative); therefore, this design did not fully account for all potential differences (e.g., physiological, cognitive mechanisms, cognitive effort) among the conditions; however, we have attempted to match the stimuli on multiple dimensions within social and nonsocial conditions. Our previous study indicated that differences in physiological arousal (skin conductance response) cannot account for the differences in emotional responses to social and nonsocial stimuli that were used (Britton et al., in press). Reaction time differences between social and nonsocial emotions were detected, suggesting that the social emotional conditions may involve additional cognitive demands (e.g., cognitive effort, heightened salience/attention, personal recollection). These differences, however, are unlikely to stem from simple stimuli processing differences since we matched stimuli and used a ‘‘subtraction’’ technique, and actually might be an integral component of ‘‘sociality’’ processing. Processing and understanding the films may require different cognitive mechanisms (e.g., inferential reasoning) and associated regions; therefore, the still frames were introduced to provide a more controlled period as the stimuli are only visual reminders of an emotionally laden event. All conditions required cognitive recall during the still frame period, and the fMRI acquisition that took place at that time captured episodic memory retrieval and associated emotional state. Like the reaction time differences, episodic memory retrieval component is essentially ‘‘subtracted out’’ when emotional and neutral conditions are compared. To minimize the effort required for maintaining the emotions, the still frames immediately followed the eliciting films. Of note, no participants reported any difficulty in maintaining the emotions during the still frame period. The emotions that represented each cell were chosen to maximize the social/nonsocial and positive/negative distinction and only two social emotions (joy and sadness) and two nonsocial emotions (appetite/food desire and bodily disgust) were studied. According to Adolphs, the selected social emotions would be classified as ‘‘basic’’ social emotions; however, future investigations could explore ‘‘other’’ social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, and shame, and additional nonsocial emotions, such as thirst, pain, and object fear. In  J.C. Britton et al. / NeuroImage 31 (2006) 397 – 409  407  addition, emotions may occupy both ends of the social dimension. For example, disgust can be evoked by body mutilation or by moral differences. Future investigation is needed to determine if these types of disgust can be dissociated based on this social dimension. Although our conservative random effects analysis and SVC protects against Type I errors, other sources of error (i.e., Type II error due to reduced power) may explain the data; thus, conclusive evidence for absence of activation awaits replication. Finally, this analysis assumed a canonical hemodynamic response function; however, emotions along the sociality dimension may have different temporal dynamics (Siegle et al., 2002), and this deserves further exploration.  Despite these limitations, future directions should also investigate the effect of sociality as a defining feature of emotion in patient populations. Many disorders have both social and emotional components to the symptomatology. Patients with autism and Asperger’s syndrome, a high functioning form of autism, have difficulties in face processing (Hobson, 1986; Hobson et al., 1988a,b; Pierce et al., 2001), show reduced eye contact with others (Hobson and Lee, 1998), and have an impaired ability to attribute emotions to others (Adolphs et al., 2002). Diminished eye gaze may explain diminished amygdala and fusiform activation when viewing faces (Dalton et al., 2005). Schizophrenia is composed of both affective and social deficits (Dworkin, 1992). Elevated tonic amygdala activity, inversely correlated with overall schizophrenic symptoms (Taylor et al., 2005), and exaggerated amygdala activation to emotional faces has been detected in schizophrenic patients (Bediou et al., 2005; Kosaka et al., 2002), suggesting abnormal processing of social emotions may play a role in schizophrenia. Patients with social phobia have an intense fear of social situations resulting in inhibited social behavior (DSM-IV). Social phobics have shown increased amygdala activation in an aversive conditioning task with neutral faces (Veit et al., 2002). In addition, patients with specific phobia (e.g., spider, snakes) have shown increased insula but similar amygdala responses to facial expressions as healthy controls (Wright et al., 2003). These disorders highlight a key intersection between social and emotional processes; however, few neuroimaging studies have attempted to examine these factors, sociality and emotion, simultaneously.  Using a combination of film induction and picture recall, we demonstrated that a social dimension of emotion may be as neurobiologically distinct and meaningful as the valence dimension for brain activation. Nonsocial (appetite/food desire and disgust) and social emotions (joy and sadness) activate partially overlapping but somewhat separate neural patterns. All conditions (nonsocial positive, nonsocial negative, social positive, social negative) activated the thalamus. Nonsocial conditions activated insula and visual cortex, whereas social conditions activated amygdala/sublenticular extended amygdala, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate. Activations within the amygdala, anterior cingulate, nucleus accumbens, and orbitofrontal cortex depended complexly on both social context and valence. Overall, these findings highlight the key role of sociality in eliciting emotion and may have implications for patient populations.

Miltner  Background: The study aimed to identify brain activation during direct and automatic processing of phobogenic stimuli in specific phobia. Methods: Responses to phobia-related and neutral pictures (spiders and mushrooms) were measured by means of event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging during two different tasks. In the identification task, subjects were asked to identify the object (spider or mushroom). In a demanding distraction task, subjects had to match geometric figures displayed in the foreground of the pictures. Results: Phobics showed greater responses to spiders versus mushrooms in the left amygdala, left insula, left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) during the identification task and in the left and right amygdala during the distraction task. All of these activations were also significantly increased compared to control subjects who did not show stronger brain activation to spiders versus mushrooms under any task condition. Conclusions: Our findings propose specific neural correlates of automatic versus direct evaluation of phobia-relevant threat. While the amygdala, especially the right amygdala, seems to be crucially involved in automatic stimuli processing, activation of areas such as the insula, ACC and DMPFC is rather associated with direct threat evaluation and requires sufficient attentional resources.  Key Words: Phobia, fMRI, amygdala, threat, attention  there  are   S pecific phobia, an anxiety disorder with a prevalence of  approximately  10%  in  the  general  population  (Fyer  1998), is characterized by rapid, exaggerated and persistent fear responses  to  phobia-specific  objects  and  situations  (American Psychiatric  Association  1994).  Although  increasing the brain circuits that are involved in the efforts to reveal pathophysiology of specific phobia, no clear picture has emerged. Based on the widely recognized role of the amygdala in the elicitation of fear-related behavior, a critical function of this brain region in the processing of phobia-relevant signals and the mediation  of  phobics’  fear  responses  has  been  proposed  (e.g., Fyer  1998;  LeDoux  1998;  Öhman  and  Mineka  2001).  By  means  of functional imaging, amygdala activation to aversive stimuli such as threat-relevant facial expressions, fear-conditioned stimuli, and other kinds of threatening information has been shown in healthy  subjects  (e.g.,  Breiter  et  al  1996;  Büchel  et  al  1998;  Morris et  al  1998a;  Critchley  et  al  2002;  Anderson  et  al  2003),  social phobics  (e.g.,  Birbaumer  et  al  1998;  Schneider  et  al  1999;  Tillfors et  al  2001,  2002;  Stein  et  al  2002;  Veit  et  al  2002;  Straube  et  al 2004a),  and  patients  with  other  anxiety  disorders  (e.g.,  Breiter and  Rauch  1996;  Liberzon  et  al  1999;  Rauch  et  al  2000;  Shin  et  al 1997,  2004;  Pissiota  et  al  2002;  Gilboa  et  al  2004).  Remarkably, numerous functional imaging studies with patients suffering from specific phobia, such as spider or snake phobia, failed to show amygdala activation when subjects were exposed  to  phobia-relevant  stimulation  (Mountz  et  al  1989; Fredrikson  et  al  1993,  1995;  Wik  et  al  1993,  1996,  1997;  Rauch  et al  1995;  Reiman  1997;  Paquette  et  al  2003;  Pissiota  et  al  2003). Some authors argued that the amygdala is apparently not involved  in  threat  processing  in  specific  phobia  (e.g.,  Paquette  et  al  From the Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology (TS, WHRM) and the Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology (H-JM), Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany.

However,  the  negative outcomes may also be due to sustained periods of symptom provocation used in previous studies, which might have induced habituation, anticipation and coping effects, and a suppression of rapid  amygdala  responses  (see  also  Breiter  et  al  1996;  Buchel  et al  1998;  Dilger  et  al  2003;  Keightley  et  al  2003;  Taylor  et  al  2003; Veltman  et  al  2004).  By  means  of  event-related  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we were previously able to show increased amygdala activation to phobia-related pictures (spiders) relative to potentially fear-related (snakes) or neutral pictures (mushrooms) in spider phobics during free viewing conditions  (Dilger  et  al  2003).  This  finding  strongly  suggested  a crucial role of the amygdala in the initial processing of phobiarelated threat. A recent block-design PET study provided evidence for an activation of the amygdala even when phobogenic stimuli  were  presented  subliminally  under  passive  viewing  conditions  (Carlsson  et  al  2004).  The  question  remains  how  amygdala responses are modulated during attentional distraction from threatening stimuli. Automatic amygdalar hyperresponsitivity to phobogenic stimuli that are presented outside of the attentional focus might be one of the most basic neural dysfunctions in phobics  (e.g.,  Fyer  1998;  LeDoux  1998;  Öhman  and  Mineka  2001; Miltner  et  al  2004).  A  related  important  question  is  whether  a possible automatic response to phobia-relevant stimuli during distraction is specific for the amygdala or also present in other brain areas.  Brain regions that have been repeatedly associated with the processing of phobia-relevant, and also of generally threatening stimuli are the insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). Increased activation of the insula was found during phobia-relevant stimulation in animal  (Rauch  et  al  1995;  Reiman  1997;  Dilger  et  al  2003; Carlsson  et  al  2004;  Straube  et  al  2004b)  and  social  phobics (Lorberbaum  et  al  2004;  Straube  et  al  2004a),  during  symptom provocation  in  subjects  with  other  anxiety  disorders  (e.g.,  Rauch et  al  1997;  Reiman  1997;  Osuch  et  al  2001),  and  during  the evaluation  of  in  healthy  subjects  (e.g., Reiman  1997;  Büchel  et  al  1998;  Critchley  et  al  2002;  Anderson  et al  2003).  Current  theories  propose  a  critical  role  of  the  insula  for emotional experiences, especially in relation to sensed dangers (for  reviews  see  Reiman  1997;  Critchley  2003).  threat-related  stimuli   BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2006;59:162–170 © 2005 Society of Biological Psychiatry  T. Straube et al  BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2005;59:162–170 163  An evaluative function during the processing of emotional in anxiety disorders were also stimuli and an involvement suggested for medial frontal areas such as the DMPFC and the ACC  (for  review  see  Phan  et  al  2002).  Activation  in  DMPFC  was described  in  animal  phobics  (Rauch  et  al  1995;  Carlsson  et  al 2004),  social  phobics  (Stein  et  al  2002;  Straube  et  al  2004a),  and healthy  control  subjects  (for  review  see  Phan  et  al  2002)  during evaluation of threat signals and other emotional salient stimuli. Furthermore, the DMPFC was demonstrated being stronger activated by tasks requiring attention to emotion than by nonemotional  tasks  (for  review  see  Phan  et  al  2002).  Finally,  activity in  DMPFC  correlated  positively  with  state  anxiety  (Simpson  et  al 2001).  Increased  activation  of  the  ACC  has  been  shown  during symptom provocation in patients with anxiety disorders, including  animal  phobia  (Rauch  et  al  1995,  1997;  Osuch  et  al  2001; Pissiota  et  al  2003;  Aouizerate  et  al  2004;  Carlsson  et  al  2004).  In healthy  subjects,  activation  of  the  ACC,  especially  of  the  rostral part, was observed during processing of threat-related as well as other  emotion-relevant  stimuli  (for  reviews  see  Bush  et  al  2000; Phan  et  al  2002).  The  ACC  has  been  proposed  to  provide  a cognitive-affective transition zone that mediates cognitive functions such as attention, evaluation, or response selection in relation  to  emotional  salient  signals  (Bush  et  al  2000).  While there is evidence that dorsal ACC regions might be associated with  strategic  control  of  task-irrelevant  salient  information  (for review  see  Bush  et  al  2000),  other  studies  suggest  that  dorsal  ACC also  serves  evaluative  functions  (e.g.,  Lane  et  al  1998;  Carter  et  al 2000;  Carlsson  et  al  2004).  It  remains  to  be  elucidated  whether the ACC is stronger activated to task-relevant versus –irrelevant threat in phobics.  In the present study, we used event-related fMRI to explore the question whether and how brain activation to phobiarelevant stimuli is modulated by the variation of attentional conditions in patients with specific phobia. Attention was focused either to phobia-relevant pictures or to a demanding distraction task. We specifically examined activation in the amygdala, insula, ACC, and DMPFC as a priori defined regions of interest (ROI). If attentional distraction does not reduce activation in the amygdala, but in other areas supposed to be important for the evaluation of threatening stimuli, then this would provide strong evidence for a specific role of the amygdala in the automatic processing of phobogenic threat. Furthermore, such a pattern of activation would also suggest regions that are less involved in the detection than in the more detailed evaluation of phobia-relevant stimuli.  Methods and Materials  Subjects  Twelve right-handed female spider phobics and twelve righthanded female control subjects participated in the study. One spider phobic subject had to be excluded from statistical analysis due to artifacts in the fMRI data, leaving a sample of eleven phobics (age: M ⫽ 20.9, SD ⫽ 2.3, range: 19-24 years; age of control subjects: M ⫽ 21.3, SD ⫽ .6, range: 21-23 years; t ⫽ .6, p ⬎ .5). All participants were students at the University of Jena. Subjects provided written informed consent to volunteer in the study. All experimental procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Jena. The participants were recruited by public advertisement. Subjects received 6 Euro per hour for participation. Spider phobics were diagnosed by means of  a  structured  clinical  interview  (Wittchen  et  al  1997)  according to the criteria for spider phobia of The Diagnostic and Statistic  Figure 1. Examples of stimuli. A circle with two small lines (each in horizontal or vertical orientation) in opposite quadrants was superimposed onto the pictures. Subjects had to indicate object (spider or mushroom; identiﬁcation task) or line orientation (parallel or orthogonal; distraction task) by button press.  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-IV,  American  Psychiatric  Association  1994).  In  addition,  spider  phobics  showed  high  scores on  a  spider  phobia  questionnaire  (SPQ,  Klorman  et  al  1974, mean ⫽ 22.2, SD ⫽ 2.7, range: 20-28). According to the outcome of the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV, spider phobics had no additional psychopathological and no neurological disorders. Control subjects did not reveal any sign of spider phobia (SPQ: mean ⫽ 1.8, SD ⫽ 1.9, range: 0-5; t ⫽ 20.8, p ⬍ .0001 compared to phobics) and reported no history of major disorders according to DSM-IV. All participants were free of medication and had never received psychotropic medication.  Stimuli and Tasks  Subjects were exposed to a series of pictures depicting forty different spiders and forty different mushrooms. In the foreground of the pictures, a circle with two small lines in opposite quadrants  was  displayed  (see  Figure  1).  Each  line  could  have  a vertical or a horizontal orientation resulting in eight possible combinations regarding line orientation and location. Each combination was randomly assigned five times to both picture categories (spiders, mushrooms). The stimuli were presented in random order via a back-projection screen onto an overhead mirror. Each picture was presented for 1000 msec. Additionally, forty null events [a fixation cross indistinguishable from the fixation  cross  seen  during  the  inter-stimulus  intervals  (Josephs and  Henson  1999)]  were  randomly  intermixed  into  the  sequence of stimuli. Stimulus onset asynchrony between two succeeding randomly occurring events was 3345 msec. The same pictures (which were shown only once within a run) were presented under two task conditions. In the identification task, subjects were asked to determine whether a spider or mushroom was shown. In the distraction task, subjects had to decide whether the lines in the foreground of the pictures were in parallel or not. The latter task was developed and tested in pilot experiments and found to be sufficiently demanding as indicated in reaction times. This foreground/background task paradigm was preferred against a spatially selective attention paradigm to limit eye movements  (Öhman  et  al  2001;  Miltner  et  al  2004).  For  judgment, subjects pressed one of two buttons of an optic fiber response box with either the index or the middle finger of the right hand. Accuracy and response time of judgements were recorded using Experimental Runtime System (ERTS) software (Version 3.29; BeriSoft Corporation, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). The order of tasks and assignment of response buttons to the answer alternatives were counterbalanced across subjects. Prior to scanning, subjects were familiarized with the task using stimuli not shown in the later experiment proper. All participants confirmed that  www.sobp.org/journal  T.

After the fMRI-session, participants rated 15 randomly selected pictures of each category using a Likert scale with nine choices to assess valence (1 ⫽ ‘very to 9 ⫽ ‘very unpleasant’) and arousal (1 ⫽ ‘not pleasant’ arousing’ to 9 ⫽ ‘very arousing’).  Behavioral data were analysed by means of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS (Version 12; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). A probability level of p ⬍ .05 was considered statistically significant. All data are expressed by mean ⫾ SEM (standard error of means). For analysis of reaction times and response accuracy, two subjects of each group had to be excluded due to technical problems during registration of button presses.  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging  In the 1.5 T magnetic resonance scanner (Magnetom Vision plus, Siemens, Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany), two runs of 185 volumes were measured using a T2* weighted echo-planar sequence (time to echo [TE] ⫽ 50 msec, flip angle ⫽ 90°, matrix ⫽ 64 x 64, field of view [FOV] ⫽ 192 mm, scan repeat time [TR] ⫽ 2.2 sec). Each volume comprised 22 axial slices (thickness ⫽ 3 mm, no gap, in plane resolution ⫽ 3 x 3 mm) being acquired with a tilted slice orientation to reduce susceptibility artifacts in inferior  parts  of  anterior  brain  areas  (Deichmann  et  al  2003). Additionally,  a  high-resolution  T1-weighted  anatomical  volume was recorded. Pre-processing and analysis of the functional data was performed using the software Brain Voyager 2000  (Version  4.9;  Brain  Innovation,  Maastricht,  The  Netherlands). The volumes were realigned to the first volume in order to minimize effects of head movements on data analysis. The further data pre-processing comprised a correction for slice time errors and spatial (8 mm full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel) as well as temporal (high pass filter: 5 cycles per run) smoothing. Anatomical and functional images were  coregistered  and  normalized  to  the  Talairach  space  (Talairach  and  Tournoux  1988).  Statistical  analysis  was  performed by multiple linear regression of the signal time course at each voxel including a correction for serial correlations. The expected blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal change for each event type ( ⫽ predictor) was modeled by a canonical hemodynamic response function (modified gamma function; delta ⫽ 2.5,  Figure 2.

In the second step, a random effect group analysis of these individual contrasts was performed. Statistical parametric maps resulting from the wholebrain, voxelwise analysis were inspected within and outside ROIs. Results of the analysis were considered statistically significant for t-values with p ⬍ .005 (uncorrected; within the ROIs) or for t-values with p ⬍ .001 (uncorrected; outside the ROIs). A cluster threshold of 4 contiguously activated voxels was used to minimize false positive results. The following ROIs were defined a  priori  using  Talairach  daemon  (http://ric.uthscsa.edu/projects/ talairachdaemon.html):  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (DMPFC), anterior insula, ACC, and amygdala. A comparison of the ROI definitions  with  the  new  atlas  of  Mai  et  al  (2004),  which  is  also based on the Talairach coordinate system, revealed good accordance between both atlases. The most exterior coordinates of each ROI were nearly identical in most cases and did not differ in any case more than 4 mm.

Functional MRI Data  for   Identiﬁcation Task. The ROI analysis for the contrast spider ⬎ mushroom revealed increased brain responses in phobics  but  not  in  control  subjects  (see  Figure  2,Table  2).  In phobics, there were greater responses to spiders versus mushrooms in the left DMPFC, left ACC, left insula, and left amygdala (see  these  ROI  data  Table  2,  Figure  2  and  3).  Direct comparisons between phobics and control subjects confirmed that the activated regions, as detected by the within-group comparison, showed also significantly increased responses in comparison  to  control  subjects  (see  Figure  2;  Table  3).  This significant task x group interaction revealed activation in left DMPFC,  left  ACC,  left  insula,  and  left  amygdala  (see  Table  3). Coordinates of maximal activated voxels were comparable for the between- as compared to the within-group contrast, except for  the  ACC  (see  Table  2  and  3).  As  indicated  in  Tables  2  and  3, the coordinates of peak activation in ACC were more anterior in the within-group comparison and more posterior in the betweengroup comparison. Further inspection of the data revealed that the activation in the posterior ACC found in the between-group comparison occurred also in the within-group contrasts, not meeting, however, the cluster extent threshold.

There was no brain region where control subjects showed stronger activation than phobics.  Direct versus Distraction Task. Furthermore, we performed comparisons that explored inter-task differences in activation to spider versus mushroom pictures in phobics. These contrasts revealed stronger activation in the left DMPFC, left ACC, and left insula in the direct relative to the distraction task in the ROI analysis  (see  for  ROI  results  Table  2,  Figure  2),  and  in  the  left fusiform gyrus [Talairach coordinates (x,y,z) and statistical values of peak activation: ⫺42,⫺41,⫺12, t ⫽ 6.9, p ⬍ .00005] in the exploratory analysis. There was no area indicating increased activation in the distraction task compared to the identification task. In exploratory analysis, there was a cluster of increased activation in right fusiform gyrus [Talairach coordinates (x,y,z) and statistical values of peak activation: 47,⫺37,⫺17, t ⫽ 4.8, p ⬍ .00005].  Inter-task differences for the amygdala were not statistically significant.  Figure  5  shows  the  mean  estimated  hemodynamic response functions (HRF) for the peak voxel in the left and right amygdala. The HRFs in rapid event-related experiments can be interpreted only with caution, they might, however, support the idea of a specific role of the right amygdala in automatic threat processing. Under the distraction condition, only responses to spiders but not to mushrooms were found in the right amygdala. In contrast, activation to all stimulus categories was found in the left amygdala regardless of task and in the right amygdala during the identification task.  Discussion  The present study provides evidence for a critical involvethe amygdala in the direct and especially in the ment of automatic processing of phobia-relevant threat. Amygdala activation was observed regardless of the attentional condition. In contrast, other brain areas, which have been implicated in the processing of phobogenic or threatening stimuli, were strongly modulated by task condition. Thus, activation in DMPFC, ACC, and insula was found in the identification task but not in the distraction task. Since there was no main or interaction effect of picture category on errors or reaction times, the fMRI outcomes cannot be related to performance differences. The absence of an interference effect in reaction times is in accordance with other studies in phobics that indicated that increased neural responses might not necessarily be paralleled by disturbed performance (e.g.,  Straube  et  al  2004a;  Kolassa  et  al,  in  press).  The  behavioral data, however, showed overall faster reaction times in phobics  T. Straube et al  BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2005;59:162–170 167  indicate that  might induction of phobic fear than for its maintenance.  the amygdala is more important for the  Most importantly, the present results strongly support the hypothesis that the amygdala plays a unique role in the automatic processing of phobia-relevant stimuli. This conclusion is based on the observation that activation in other ROIs was not only reduced but absent during the distraction task. Remarkably, distraction led to pronounced responses in both right and left amygdala, while only the left amygdala was activated during the identification task. In our previous study, we found activation of the left but not the right amygdala to phobia-related threat in spider phobics during a passive viewing condition, which can be assumed to involve rather direct processing and evaluation of threat  (Dilger  et  al  2003).  Several  studies  have  suggested  a specific role of the right amygdala in automatic stimuli processing, while more detailed decoding of the importance of stimuli might be associated, rather, with the activity of the left amygdala (Morris  et  al  1998a;  Wright  et  al  2001;  Glascher  et  al  2003;  but  see Critchley  et  al  2002).  However,  a  recent  study  by  Carlsson  and co-workers  (2004)  found  activation  of  the  left  but  not  right amygdala in animal phobics during subliminal presentation of phobia-related  pictures  under  passive  viewing  conditions.  These results might be related to the use of a block design in the study of  Carlson  et  al  (2004),  which  does  not  allow  measurement  of trial specific activation. Furthermore, free viewing conditions might involve stronger evaluation, or anticipation and guessing effects, and thus changed amygdalar processes, compared to demanding distraction tasks. Further studies are strongly needed for the investigation of a possible lateralization of amygdala responses in dependence of experimental conditions such as task instruction or stimuli presentation.  The hyperresponsitivity of the amygdala to phobogenic signals might be a key mechanism in the elicitation of rapid fear responses, especially if these occur outside of the subjects’ current attentional focus  as  it  was  shown,  for  example,  recently  by  our  group  (Miltner et  al  2004).  Activation  of  other  areas,  such  as  the  insula,  DMPFC,  and ACC seems to be a subsequent process, although other mechanisms such as inhibitory processes during distraction or simultaneous activity during direct threat processing cannot be excluded. Rapid amygdala responses are also implicated in the emotional modulation of activation in visual areas such as the fusiform gyrus—which showed robust responses in the current study—by strong feedback connections  (Amaral  and  Insausti  1992;  Armony  and  LeDoux  1997). Thus, the neuromodulatory influence of the amygdala can lead to enhanced capacity of visual identification and analysis of threat (e.g.,  Armony  and  LeDoux  1997;  Morris  et  al  1998b;  Vuilleumier  et al  2001).  This  in  turn  might  influence  evaluative  functions  and emotional reactions that are mediated, for example, by the insula and medial frontal areas.  The insula activation, which was observed in the present study during the identification task, is in accordance with previous studies with phobics as well as patients suffering from other anxiety disorders. For example, activation of the insula has been described in animal phobics in response to real or imagined feared  animals  (Rauch  et  al  1995;  Reiman  1997),  phobia-related pictures  (Dilger  et  al  2003;  Carlsson  et  al  2004),  phobia-related words  (Straube  et  al  2004b),  and  fearful  faces  (Wright  et  al  2003). Insula activation was also demonstrated in social phobics during the  processing  of  angry  faces  (Straube  et  al  2004a),  and  during symptom  provocation  in  patients  with  panic  disorder  (Reiman 1997)  or  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (Rauch  et  al  1997;  Osuch  et al  2001).  Significantly  increased  activation  of  the  insula  associated with provocation of clinically relevant anxiety symptoms  www.sobp.org/journal  Figure 5. Mean estimated hemodynamic response function (HRF) of the amygdala in phobics. The plots show the HRFs for following voxel coordinates  (see  also  Table  2):  x  ⫽ ⫺18,  y  ⫽ ⫺4,  z  ⫽ ⫺12  (left  amygdala);  x  ⫽  15, y ⫽ ⫺1, z ⫽ ⫺15 (right amygdala).  regardless of picture category, which might be due to generally increased arousal and motivation in phobics.  In contrast to numerous previous functional imaging studies (Mountz  et  al  1989;  Fredrikson  et  al  1993,  1995;  Wik  et  al  1993, 1996,  1997;  Rauch  et  al  1995;  Reiman  1997;  Paquette  et  al  2003; Pissiota  et  al  2003),  results  of  the  present  study  confirm  a  role  of the amygdala in specific phobia and, thus, also the outcome of our  recent  event-related  fMRI  study  (Dilger  et  al  2003).  These consistent new findings challenge the view that the amygdala is not involved in the processing of feared stimuli in specific phobia as  it  was  concluded  by  several  authors  (e.g.,  Paquette  et  al  2003; Wright  et  al  2003;  Rosen  2004).  The  event-related  fMRI  studies suggest a crucial function of the amygdala during the initial confrontation with disorder-relevant stimuli. During sustained periods of symptom provocation, which were used in all studies mentioned above, amygdala activation might have been absent due to insensitivity of such paradigms to detect rapid amygdala responses  (see  also  Breiter  et  al  1996;  Büchel  et  al  1998;  Dilger  et al  2003;  Keightley  et  al  2003;  Taylor  et  al  2003;  Veltman  et  al 2004).  Taken  together,  the  outcomes  of  the  different  studies  168 BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2005;59:162–170  T. Straube et al  was  reported  by  Rauch  and  colleagues  (1997),  who  used  pooled data across different anxiety disorders (obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder). In healthy subjects, the insular cortex has been shown to be involved in the recognition and experience of aversive states such  as  disgust,  fear,  or  pain  (e.g.,  Phillips  et  al  1997;  Reiman 1997;  Critchley  et  al  2002;  Peyron  et  al  2002).  Responses  in  the insula strongly depend on the amount of threat-related attention (e.g.,  Gorno-Tempini  et  al  2001;  Critchley  et  al  2002;  Anderson  et al  2003;  Winston  et  al  2003).  It  has  been  suggested  that  the  insula might support the interaction of perceived threat signals and bodily states of arousal leading to subjective emotional experiences  such  as  the  feeling  of  fear  (for  reviews  see  Reiman  1997; Critchley  2003).  Remarkably,  in  a  previous  study  with  social phobics, we found increased insula activation regardless of whether subjects were instructed to attend to emotional expressions  or  to  nonemotional  aspects  of  angry  faces  (Straube  et  al 2004a).  However,  in  that  study  the  distracting  task  was  not  very demanding and results were interpreted as evidence that social phobics strongly processed and evaluated the threatening faces even if this was not required. The present results confirm the hypothesis that the insula does not automatically respond to phobia-related stimuli but requires attentional resources.  Similar  to  the  insula,  responses  in  DMPFC  and  the  ACC were found only during the identification task. The results for the DMPFC correspond to previous findings in animal phobics, social phobics and healthy control subjects, who showed DMPFC activity during the evaluation of threat-relevant stimulation  (Rauch  et  al  1995;  Simpson  et  al  2001;  Phan  et  al  2002; Stein  et  al  2002;  Straube  et  al  2004a;  Carlsson  et  al  2004). Furthermore, the DMPFC is implicated in anxiety and in the general assessment of the emotional significance of stimuli and  situations  (Simpson  et  al  2001;  Phan  et  al  2002).  The DMPFC borders posteriorly on the ACC. The activation of the ACC during the identification task supports a role of this brain region in threat processing in specific phobia and, more generally, in anxiety disorders as suggested by previous studies  (Rauch  et  al  1995,  1997;  Osuch  et  al  2001;  Boshuisen  et al  2002;  Pissiota  et  al  2003;  Aouizerate  et  al  2004;  Carlsson  et al  2004).  Remarkably,  direct  stimulation  of  the  rostral  ACC evokes  anxiety  in  humans  (Laitinen  1979)  suggesting  a  functional relevance of ACC activity in anxiety provocation studies. In healthy subjects, involvement of the ACC in emotional evaluation of threatening and other salient emotional stimuli was  repeatedly  described  (for  reviews  see  Bush  et  al  2000; Phan  et  al  2002).  Although  the  possibility  of  an  automatic  ACC response  threat  signals  has  been  suggested  (e.g.,  Vuilleumier  et  al  2001),  the  findings  of  the  present  study  indicate that ACC responses are rather associated with focused attention toward phobogenic stimuli. The specific role of the spatially separated foci of ACC activity detected in the present study  (for  similar  findings  see  Carlson  et  al  2004)  remains  to  be elucidated in further studies. It should be noted that several lines of evidence suggest that activation of prefrontal areas and especially of medial prefrontal cortex and ACC might modulate  activity  of  the  amygdala  (e.g.,  Keightley  et  al  2003; Taylor  et  al  2003;  Ochsner  et  al  2004;  Shin  et  al  2004). Therefore, amygdala responses might be suppressed under conditions of sustained stimuli processing such as in the symptom provocation studies mentioned above. By means of this mechanism, the (fear) behavior becomes less dependent on automatic, sensory driven, amygdalar processes.  to   In summary, our results propose specific neural correlates  www.sobp.org/journal  for the automatic versus direct evaluation of phobia-relevant stimuli. The insula, ACC, DMPFC, and the left amygdala are involved in the latter process and may mediate the emotional experience of fear. Activation in the insula and ACC requires sufficient attentional resources, since activation in these areas was absent during visual distraction. The amygdala, especially the right amygdala, seems to play a specific role in the automatic processing of phobogenic signals. Thus, the activation of the amygdala might be an initial step in the rapid elicitation of phobic responses to feared objects. Further studies should analyze correlations between symptom severity and brain activation. A limitation of the current study was the small and relatively homogeneous sample of phobics, which did not allow such analysis. Furthermore, future studies should dedicate their analysis also to other areas than the ROIs of the present study, such as the parahippocampal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex, which might also play a significant role in the  processing  of  phobogenic  threat  (e.g.,  Dilger  et  al  2003; Carlson  et  al  2004;  Straube  et  al  2004a;  Veltman  et  al  2004).

In this study, participants engaged in a recognition task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. They viewed neutral titles and indicated whether each title had been presented with an image during the study phase. Neural activity and connectivity during retrieval of titles associated with positive and negative images were compared with age (treated as a continuous variable) included as a regressor of interest. Aging was associated with increased prefrontal activation for retrieval of positive and negative memories, but this pattern was more widespread for negative memories. Aging also was associated with greater negative connectivity between a left hippocampal seed region and multiple regions of prefrontal cortex, but this effect of age occurred during negative retrieval only. These ﬁndings demonstrate that age-related changes in prefrontal recruitment and connectivity during retrieval depend on memory valence. The use of a life span approach also emphasized both continuities and discontinuities in recruitment and connectivity across the adult life span, highlighting the insights to be gained from using a full life span sample.

However, it has been suggested that memory impairments in older adults can be mitigated by the presence of emotional arousal (Kensinger, 2009b). Critically, some studies have found that older adults’ emotional enhancement is particularly strong when the information is of positive valence (Charles et al., 2003), suggesting that valence, and not only emotional arousal, can inﬂuence memory processes in healthy aging. This age-related enhancement of positive information has been of great interest in the cognitive aging literature, as it represents a special circumstance in which age-related cognitive declines may be reduced by speciﬁc task-related factors. Further, both young and older adults may process positive and negative information differently, with negative information associated with more visual processing and positive information associated with more conceptual processing (Kensinger, 2009b). As such, age-related changes to positive and negative event retrieval may  * Corresponding author at: Department of Psychology, Boston College, McGuinn Hall, Rm 504B, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, USA.

One important question that has emerged from the examination of emotional memory in healthy aging is how emotion may alter neural recruitment associated with speciﬁc mnemonic processes, and how these inﬂuences may differ as a function of age. Identifying the neural correlates of this effect could help researchers understand the underlying cognitive mechanisms contributing to emotional enhancement in older adults. Prior studies have suggested that healthy aging is associated with increased prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during encoding of emotional relative to neutral information (see St Jacques et al., 2009a for review), and of positive relative to negative information (Leclerc and Kensinger, 2008). In addition to age-related differences in neural recruitment, previous studies have also identiﬁed age-related changes in neural connectivity during emotional encoding. Speciﬁcally, healthy aging inﬂuences connectivity within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and between the MTL and PFC. Amygdala-hippocampal connections may be weakened in older adults during the encoding of negative information (St. Jacques et al., 2009b), and older adults show stronger connectivity between the hippocampus, amygdala, and mPFC during the encoding of positive information than do young adults (Addis et al., 2010). Age-related changes in neural activity and connectivity during emotional encoding have been  J.H. Ford et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2770e2784  2771  explained as potentially revealing age-related shifts in selfreferential processing, where older adults interpret positive stimuli in a more self-relevant way (Kensinger and Leclerc, 2009), as well as age-related increases in emotional regulation strategies in healthy older adults (St. Jacques et al., 2009b).  Although most research examining the effects of age on the neural correlates of emotional memory has focused on encoding processes, several behavioral studies suggest that healthy aging also has an effect on processes associated with retrieval. Speciﬁcally, older participants exhibit greater increases in ratings of positive valence for personal memories (Kennedy et al., 2004), even when the age of encoding is held constant, and they perceive their recall of positive events to be more vivid than negative ones (Petrican et al., 2008). Investigating the effect of emotional valence on the neural correlates of memory retrieval may elucidate the reasons for these differences. Previous studies have shown increased activity in the amygdala (Dolan et al., 2000; Murty et al., 2009; but see, Taylor et al., 1998) and lateral frontal lobes (Murty et al., 2009) during retrieval of emotional relative to neutral events, thought to reﬂect the retrieval of affective content or the reexperience of an affective response, and the monitoring and elaboration of the memory, respectively. However, the effect of valence and healthy aging on these processes is still unknown. The present study extends prior work by examining age-related changes in neural recruitment during retrieval of positive and negative information.  Behavioral studies of memory retrieval reveal linear declines in performance starting as early as in one’s early 30s (Salthouse, 2011). Similarly, behavioral studies with continuous age designs suggest that age-related changes in emotional experience (Pasupathi and Carstensen, 2003) and emotional memory (Carstensen and TurkCharles, 1994) may occur gradually over time. Despite this evidence, previous studies examining the effects of healthy aging on neural recruitment during memory tasks have often compared young adults (typically 18- to35-year-old) with older adults (often aged more than 60-year-old), ignoring individuals between the ages of 35 and 60 years. Therefore, it currently is unknown whether the neural changes of middle-aged adults are similar to those of older adults. In addition, while previous research has shown that the emotional valence can have opposite effects on neural recruitment in young and older adults (Leclerc and Kensinger, 2008), it is unknown whether this change is discrete (i.e., valence inﬂuences neural recruitment for young and middle-aged adults in the same way until a certain age, then this effect is reversed) or gradual (i.e., middle-aged adults exhibit a pattern of activity i.e., in-between that of young and older adults). To answer these questions, the present study uses a life span assessment to examine the effects of emotion on the memory network.  One potential difﬁculty with examining the neural activity associated with emotional episodic memory retrieval is that representing participants with studied emotional and neutral stimuli could lead to neural differences stemming from the processing of the retrieval cues, in addition to those related to remembering the encoding event. A number of recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have avoided this potential confound of on-line emotional processing by having participants encode a neutral item in a neutral or emotional study context and using the neutral item as the retrieval cue (Maratos et al., 2001; Sterpenich et al., 2006). This method helps ensure that valence differences at retrieval are related to the mnemonic content and not the retrieval cue. In the present study, we use a paradigm that has been reported previously (Ford et al., 2014), in which participants encode positive, negative, and neutral images presented with neutral titles. During a scanned retrieval session, participants view the neutral titles, to avoid confounds associated with an emotional retrieval cue, and retrieve the related emotional or neutral image.  The present study examines age-related changes in neural recruitment, particularly in prefrontal regions, and in MTL-PFC connectivity during retrieval of emotional events. Based on prior evidence that older adults shift to prefrontal rather than sensory based processing (Davis et al., 2008), we hypothesize that healthy aging will be associated with increased prefrontal and decreased posterior activation during successful retrieval. We are particularly interested in how emotional valence interacts with aging to inﬂuence prefrontal activity and connectivity. During encoding, healthy older adults recruit prefrontal regions to a greater extent during positive relative to negative events, whereas young adults exhibit the reverse activation pattern (i.e., negative > positive; Leclerc and Kensinger, 2008), and healthy aging is associated with increased MTL-PFC connectivity during encoding of positive events, but not negative (Addis et al., 2010). Similar age-related increases in prefrontal activity and connectivity during positive event retrieval would demonstrate that age-related changes in emotional processing seen during encoding extend to retrieval. Conversely, agerelated changes in neural activity and connectivity that do not replicate these patterns would suggest that emotion inﬂuences distinct cognitive processes during encoding and retrieval.  2. Methods  2.1. Participants  Data from 63 healthy adults (mean age ¼ 47.92 years, standard deviation [SD] ¼ 19.80, ages 19e85 years; mean education ¼ 16.56, SD ¼ 2.34) are reported. The ratio of males to females was roughly one-to-one (30 females and 33 males) and was approximately equivalent within each decade (43%e67% male in each decade), with no signiﬁcant difference in this distribution across decades (x2(6, N ¼ 63) ¼ 0.85, p ¼ 0.99). Twenty-seven of the young adult subjects from this sample were included in a recent article examining the interactive effects of emotional valence and memory phase on neural recruitment (Ford et al., 2014). Gender distribution was even across the age range and age was not signiﬁcantly correlated with education (p ¼ 0.68). Two additional participants were recruited but not scanned because of contraindications for fMRI (ages 50 and 75 years; both male). Another 10 participants were scanned, but were excluded from the current analysis because of equipment malfunction (n ¼ 1; age ¼ 49 years, education ¼ 16 years, male), an abnormal structural scan (n ¼ 1, age ¼ 49 years, edu ¼ 17, female), excessive motion (n ¼ 1, age ¼ 56 years, edu ¼ 16, male), voluntary early termination of the MR session (n ¼ 1, age ¼ 49 years, edu ¼ 14, female), or low behavioral performance (n ¼ 6, mean age ¼ 55.64, SD ¼ 18.12, ages 30e83 years; mean education ¼ 16.12, SD ¼ 3.49; 2 female). Participants were right-handed native English speakers without psychiatric illness or neurologic disorder and were recruited from the greater Boston area. All participants were paid for their participation and gave written informed consent in accordance with the requirements of the Institutional Review Board at Boston College.  All participants completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck et al., 1988) to examine self-reported symptoms of anxiety, as well as the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1961) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (Sheikh and Yesavage, 1986) to evaluate symptoms of depression. In addition, participants engaged in a series of tests intended to examine general cognitive ability, vocabulary, verbal ﬂuency, working memory, and memory (both immediate and delayed). Finally, all participants completed a battery of cognitive tests implemented in CogState, a computerized neuropsychological test battery that was approximately 30 minutes in duration. The battery included 6 subtests that examine a range of cognitive abilities, including: Detection Task (speed of processing),  2772  J.H. Ford et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2770e2784  Identiﬁcation Task (visual attention), One Card Learning Task (visual learning and memory), One Back Task (attention and/or working memory), Two Back Task (attention and/or working memory), and Set-Shifting (executive function); these have acceptable criterion and construct validity in a neuropsychological context (www. cogstate.com/; Maruff et al., 2009). The relations of age with all cognitive variables are reported in Supplementary Table 1. In brief, healthy aging was associated with decreased anxiety, increased vocabulary, and impairments on tasks involving long term memory (e.g., delayed visual pairs) and executive control (e.g., digit/symbol task, mental arithmetic, mental control, digit span, and set shifting). In addition, older adults showed signiﬁcantly greater retrieval times in 4 of the 6 CogState computer tasks.  2.2. Materials  Stimuli were the 480 pictures (160 positive, 160 negative, and 160 neutral) and the neutral titles used in Ford et al. (2014) and selected from the IAPS database, Geneva Affective Picture Database and images used in Waring and Kensinger (2011). Based on normative data available at the time of image selection, arousal ratings were equated for positive and negative images, whereas positive and negative images were signiﬁcantly higher in arousal than neutral images. However, arousal ratings given by participants in the present study were higher for negative relative to positive images (see Section 3.1). Neutral titles were selected for each picture to describe the picture as closely as possible. To conﬁrm title neutrality, 5 pilot participants (4 female; mean age ¼ 21.6 years) were asked to view all titles and determine whether they were neutral, positive, or negative. Titles were replaced if 2 or more participants rated them as either positive or negative (e.g., “Medical Examination” was changed to “Rubber Gloves” and “Alleyway” was changed to “Concrete Arches”). The 480 title-picture pairs were divided into 4 sets of 120 pictures each (40 positive, 40 negative, and 40 neutral) for counterbalancing purposes.  2.3. Procedure  Following instruction and a short practice, participants encoded 1 set of 120 title-image pairs. Titles (e.g., “Lettuce”) were paired with a positive, negative, or neutral image (e.g., a piece of rotting lettuce with bugs crawling on it as a negative image). In an intentional encoding task (outside the scanner) participants were given 3 seconds to make a decision regarding the appropriateness of the word as a description of the image (1 ¼ poor description, 2 ¼ acceptable description, and 3 ¼ very good description). After a halfhour delay (mean ¼ 34.3 minutes, SD ¼ 7.8), participants took part in a scanned retrieval task. Participants were presented with the 240 titles (120 neutral titles that were studied during the encoding phase and 120 unstudied neutral titles) randomly across 6 retrieval runs of equal length. Participants were given up to 4 seconds to decide whether the word was “old” (i.e., seen previously) or “new” (i.e., not seen previously). The screen was removed following the participant’s button press. Across participants, it was varied which items were studied and which were reserved as foils on the recognition test.  Immediately following an “old” response, 80% of the time, participants were asked to “Elaborate” on the old item (i.e., think about the image presented with the title and the experience with that title and image at encoding) for 5 seconds. Participants then rated (on a 1e5 scale) how well they remembered the image and their own personal thoughts and feelings while encoding the item. Each rating was presented for 3 seconds and the order of the ratings was alternated across participants. To discourage participants from beginning to elaborate during the search phase, and to distinguish  activity during search from activity during elaboration, 20% of trials were catch trials; instead of an elaboration phase, the next trial was presented. Following a “new” response, 80% of the time, participants moved on to the next trial. To minimize the likelihood that participants would automatically begin preparing for the next trial after a “new” response, on 20% of the trials, participants were asked to “Imagine” an image that could have accompanied the new item for 5 seconds. They then rated (on a 1e5 scale) the vividness of the image they generated for the new item and the vividness of their own personal thoughts and feelings. Following each trial, participants viewed a ﬁxation cross for 0e6 seconds to introduce jitter.  After being removed from the scanner, participants were represented with the images from the encoding phase. They rated each image’s valence and arousal on a 1e7 scale and indicated which speciﬁc emotions they experienced with each image. This portion was self-paced and participants were encouraged to respond based on their initial reaction.  2.4. Data acquisition  Participants’ heads were stabilized in a Siemens Tim Trio 3 Tesla scanner. A localizing scan and auto-align scout were followed by a high resolution multi-echo T1 structural scan for anatomic visualization (176 1 mm slices, repetition time ¼ 2200 ms, echo time (TE) 1 ¼1.64 ms, TE2 ¼ 3.5 ms, TE3 ¼ 5.36 ms, TE4 ¼ 7.22 ms). Six runs of whole brain, gradient-echo, echo planar images (31 3 mm slices aligned along the line between the anterior and posterior commissures, 20% skip, TR ¼ 2 seconds, TE ¼ 30 ms, ﬂip angle ¼ 90) were acquired during memory retrieval using interleaved slice acquisition. A diffusion weighted scan was collected but will not be discussed. Response data were collected using a magnet-safe button response box.  2.5. Preprocessing and data analysis  Images were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in MATLAB. Images were co-registered, realigned, normalized (resampled at 3 mm at the segmentation stage and written at 2 mm at the normalization stage), and smoothed using a Gaussian 8 mm kernel. The current analysis focused on effects of valence and healthy aging on memory search, modeled as an eventrelated response at cue-onset.  The ﬁrst level fMRI analysis examined the effect of emotional valence (i.e., positive or negative events) on neural activity during accurate “old” responses to studied items (i.e., “hits”). Neutral hits, incorrect responses and correct “new” responses to positive, negative, and neutral items, although not relevant for the current analysis, were included in each model as 5 separate nuisance variables. Contrasts were used to examine neural recruitment during successful retrieval of positive events relative to baseline, negative events relative to baseline, positive relative to negative events, and negative relative to positive events.  One-sample t-tests were used at the random-effects level to examine neural recruitment during successful retrieval of positive and negative events. Age was included as a continuous variable of interest, allowing for identiﬁcation of regions in which activity increased as a function of age (i.e., regions showing increased activity for older relative to younger participants) and regions in which activity decreased as a function of age (i.e., regions showing increased activity for younger relative to older participants). Conjunction analyses were conducted to identify regions that exhibited signiﬁcant age effects in both positive and negative event retrieval. Conjunction analyses were performed by creating explicit masks of one contrast (e.g., the effect of aging during positive event  J.H. Ford et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2770e2784  2773  retrieval) and applying this mask to the second contrast (e.g., the effect of aging during negative event retrieval). This joint analysis allows us to identify regions that show signiﬁcant age effects, regardless of valence. Activity within a 5 mm sphere around peak voxels in several regions of interest (ROIs) was extracted using the REX toolbox (downloaded from http://web.mit.edu/swg/software. htm). Activity in these ROIs was entered into a repeatedmeasures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with valence (i.e., positive and negative) as a within-subjects variable and age as a continuous variable of interest.  The signiﬁcance threshold for all analyses was set at p < 0.005 (uncorrected). Monte Carlo simulations (Slotnick et al., 2003), run with the normalized voxel size of 2  2  2, determined that a 29voxel extent corrected results to p < 0.05. Therefore, we discuss all clusters that reach this threshold. However, because this relatively large voxel extent may put us at risk for type 2 error (Lieberman and Cunningham, 2009), we report all clusters with a voxel extent of 10 or more in the tables, as these results may be relevant for the purposes of future reviews and meta-analyses. Clusters reaching signiﬁcance were overlaid on anatomic images from MRICron. For visualization purposes, activity within a 5 mm sphere around peak voxels was extracted using the REX (downloaded from http://web. mit.edu/swg/software.htm) toolbox. For all analyses, reported coordinates reﬂect the peak activity within active regions. These coordinates were converted from MNI coordinates to Talairach space, localized using the Talairach Client, and conﬁrmed with the Talairach and Tournoux atlas (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988).  The present study examined connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal regions during successful retrieval of positive and negative events, using the generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI; http://brainmap.wisc.edu/PPI; McLaren et al., 2012) toolbox in SPM8. The gPPI toolbox, which is conﬁgured to automatically accommodate multiple task conditions in the same PPI model, compares functional connectivity with a single seed region across tasks. Based on prior research conducted at encoding (Addis et al., 2010), we had an a priori hypothesis that healthy aging would be associated with alterations in prefrontal-MTL connectivity. Therefore, we selected our gPPI seed region from within the medial temporal lobe and identiﬁed prefrontal regions in which MTL connectivity was inﬂuenced by an age-by-valence interaction.  To identify an MTL seed region, we ran an omnibus contrast examining retrieval (hits) of both positive and negative events relative to baseline, controlling for age. This contrast identiﬁed clusters within bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus at p < 0.005, with no suprathreshold voxels in the amygdala. The most signiﬁcant cluster was within the left hippocampus, a region that may be critically involved in emotion memory, particularly in its interactions with the amygdala (LaBar and Cabeza, 2006). Therefore, a peak voxel within the left hippocampus ( 24,  28,  6) was used to create volumes of interest (VOIs) for each subject. Speciﬁcally, for each subject, a VOI was generated by creating a 6 mm sphere around this voxel (Fig. 3A). Within each subject, the gPPI toolbox was used to estimate functional connectivity across the entire brain with this 6 mm VOI in the 2 memory conditions (i.e., positive hits and negative hits) and to calculate the 2 contrasts of interest (i.e., positive hits > negative hits, negative hits > positive hits) as well as a conjunction (i.e., positive hits and negative hits). At the group level, contrast ﬁles from each of the 3 individualsubject gPPIs were entered into separate, single-sample t-tests, with age as a continuous variable of interest. The continuous age variable allowed us to examine regions in which the differences in correlation values increased or decreased as a function of age. The ﬁrst contrast looked at regions that were more positively correlated with left hippocampal activity in both positive and negative hits. The second identiﬁed regions that were more positively or less  negatively correlated with left hippocampal activity for positive than negative memory. The ﬁnal contrast identiﬁed regions that were more positively or less negatively correlated with left hippocampal activity for negative than positive memory. Two additional group analyses were conducted for each of the memory conditions (i.e., positive hits and negative hits) to disambiguate the underlying effects identiﬁed in these contrasts. As with the prior analysis, the signiﬁcance threshold was set at p < 0.005 with a 29-voxel extent (correcting results to p < 0.05), with a voxel extent of 10 reported in the tables. In addition, prefrontal regions of a prior interest were examined as this more liberal threshold.  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral results  The appropriateness of each image’s verbal title was evaluated during the encoding phase of the current task. Participants rated the titles for negative images as less appropriate than positive (t(62) ¼ 11.08, p < 0.001) and neutral (t(62) ¼ 12.46, p < 0.001) image titles. Age was not correlated with ratings of appropriateness for any emotion condition (p > 0.5 for all 3 conditions). Memory accuracy and retrieval time were entered into a repeated measures analysis of variance, with age as a covariate of interest and emotional valence as a within-subjects factor. Accuracy did not differ as a function of valence (p ¼ 0.64), but was associated with age (F(1,61) ¼ 11.75, p < 0.001). Speciﬁcally, increased age was associated with decreased accuracy for neutral (r ¼  0.50, p < 0.001), positive (r ¼  0.50, p < 0.001), and negative events (r ¼  0.49, p < 0.001). There was a trend for valence to affect retrieval time (p ¼ 0.09) with participants responding faster to retrieval cues for neutral relative to positive (t(62) ¼ 2.73, p < 0.01) and negative events (t(62) ¼ 3.33, p < 0.001), and to positive relative to negative events (t(26) ¼ 2.15, p < 0.05). Healthy aging was associated with increased retrieval times (F(1,61) ¼ 9.23, p < 0.005) for neutral (r ¼ 0.39, p < 0.001), positive (r ¼ 0.32, p < 0.05), and negative events (r ¼ 0.35, p < 0.005). Importantly, the age-by-valence interaction was not signiﬁcant for either variable (p > 0.1 for both comparisons). Ratings collected after the memory test conﬁrmed that positive images were judged as more positive than neutral images (t(62) ¼ 12.35, p < 0.001) which were judged as more positive than negative images (t(62) ¼ 15.89, p < 0.001). Additionally, negative and positive images were judged as more arousing than neutral images (p < 0.001 for both contrasts), and negative images were more arousing than positive (t(62) ¼ 3.97, p < 0.001). Age was not associated with ratings of arousal or valence for any emotion condition (p > 0.1 for all contrasts).  3.2.  Imaging results  3.2.1. Effects of emotional valence on neural recruitment during retrieval  When controlling for the effect of age by inclusion of the regressor for age, retrieval of negative events was associated with increased activity in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), lateral temporal lobe, posterior and anterior cingulate, MTLs, and visual cortex compared with the positive event retrieval (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Relative to negative events, positive event retrieval was associated with increased activity in the premotor cortex (Table 1).  inferior parietal  lobes,  3.2.2.

During retrieval of both positive and negative events, healthy aging was associated with increased activity in ventral and dorsal prefrontal regions, inferior parietal lobe, left lateral temporal lobe, posterior cingulate, and bilateral insula (Table 2). Increased age was associated with decreased activity in posterior regions associated with visual processing, such as the bilateral lingual gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, and right cuneus (Table 2).  To better understand the relations between healthy aging and neural activity in regions identiﬁed in this analysis, we selected 2 clusters as ROIs from which parameter estimates could be extracted. Estimates for negative and positive retrieval were extracted from a 5 mm sphere surrounding the peak voxel of each cluster (Fig. 1AeD), and repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted with valence as a within-subjects variable and age as a covariate of interest. For visualization purposes, the continuous age range was split into 5 age groups that were approximately equivalent in size (N ¼ 12, 14, 13, 12, and 12) whose average parameter estimates have been graphed for each region (Fig. 1CeD). One of these peaks (medial prefrontal cortex, BA 10;  16, 56, 14) was selected from regions that exhibited increased activity as a function of age (Fig. 1A and C). Activity did not differ as a function of emotional valence and there was no age-by-valence interaction (p > 0.1). However, activity increased as a function age (F(1,61) ¼ 14.49, p < 0.001). A second peak within the cuneus (BA 18; 6,  74, 18) was selected from regions that exhibited decreased activity as a function of age (Fig. 1B and D). Estimates for both positive and negative events decreased  as a function of age (F(1,61) ¼ 10.38, p < 0.005), but the effect of valence and the age-by-valence interaction were not signiﬁcant (p > 0.1 for both contrasts).  3.2.3. Differential effects of valence on neural recruitment as a function of healthy aging  Two additional analyses examined the effects of healthy aging on valence-related differences in neural activity. Speciﬁcally, this analysis identiﬁed regions that exhibited age-related increases in the positive > negative event contrast and in the negative > positive event contrast. No regions were associated with age-related increases in activity during positive relative to negative event retrieval. However, healthy aging was associated with increased activity during negative relative to positive event retrieval in a number of frontal and parietal regions, as well as the left lateral temporal lobe and posterior cingulate (Table 3). One cluster (orbitofrontal cortex, BA 11; 22, 34,  12) was selected as an ROI from which to extract parameter estimates (Fig. 2AeC). For visualization purposes, the continuous age range was split into 5 age groups whose average parameter estimates have been graphed (Fig. 2C). Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted and there was a strong trend toward a main effect of age (p ¼ 0.053). The effect of valence was signiﬁcant (F(1,61) ¼ 5.01, p < 0.05), and this effect was qualiﬁed by an age-by-valence interaction (F(1,61) ¼ 8.09, p < 0.01).  Additional analyses revealed that the age-by-valence interaction occurred because age was correlated with activity during retrieval of negative events (r ¼ 0.36, p < 0.005), but not of positive events (p > 0.6). To better understand this interaction, t-tests were conducted comparing activity during positive and negative events in  J.H.

These t-tests suggest that the age difference in positive and negative events was driven by valence effects in the youngest and oldest individuals in our sample. Speciﬁcally, activity during negative events was signiﬁcantly greater than positive events for the oldest age group (70e85 years) for and activity during positive events was greater than negative events for the youngest age group (19e25 years; Fig. 2C).  3.2.4. Regions exhibiting differential neural connectivity with the left hippocampus  In the gPPI analysis, we examined the effects of age on neural connectivity with the left hippocampus during positive and negative event retrieval. During both positive and negative event retrieval, healthy aging was associated with decreased functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and a widespread, bilateral network of regions including dorsal and ventral PFC, lateral and medial temporal lobe (including the amygdala), parietal lobe, and posterior visual regions (Table 4; Fig. 3B). Age was not associated with increased connectivity of the left hippocampus with any neural regions.  We were particularly interested in regions exhibiting agerelated differences in the effects of emotional valence on neural connectivity with the left hippocampus. Healthy aging was not associated with greater decreases in hippocampal connectivity during positive relative to negative event retrieval in any clusters at the 29 voxel threshold (Table 4). In the reverse contrast, we found  that healthy aging was associated with greater decreases in hippocampal connectivity during negative relative positive event retrieval in bilateral lateral prefrontal regions (Table 4, Fig. 3C).  To better understand this interaction, beta estimates of functional connectivity were extracted from a 5-mm ROI surrounding the peak voxel of the left vlPFC ( 46, 44, 14; Fig. 4A) for positive and negative event retrieval (Fig. 4B). For visualization purposes, the continuous age range was split into 5 age groups whose average parameter estimates have been graphed (Fig. 4C). Healthy aging was negatively correlated with connectivity during negative event retrieval (r ¼  0.48, p < 0.001), but not positive event retrieval (p ¼ 0.98). Further, connectivity during positive event retrieval was signiﬁcantly greater than negative event retrieval in the oldest adult group only (t(11) ¼ 3.13, p < 0.05).  Regression analyses were conducted to examine linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of age on connectivity estimates for positive and negative events. As expected, the linear model was signiﬁcant for negative events (F(1,61) ¼ 18.34, p < 0.001) but not positive events (p > 0.1). Adding a quadratic coefﬁcient to the regression did not provide a signiﬁcant improvement in model ﬁt for either condition. Finally, adding a cubic coefﬁcient signiﬁcantly improved model ﬁt relative to the linear equation for negative event retrieval (p < 0.05) and led to a signiﬁcant model for positive event retrieval (F(3,59) ¼ 3.41, p < 0.05; Fig. 4B).  At the more liberal threshold of p < 0.005 with a 10 voxel extent, analyses revealed additional age-related decreases in connectivity  2776  J.H.

Prior research has highlighted the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both voluntary and automatic emotion regulation (Phillips et al., 2008) and has shown age-by-valence reversals during impression formation (Cassidy et al., 2013). Because of the potential importance of this region in age and emotion processing, we examined its connectivity patterns (notably, Monte Carlo simulations [Slotnick et al., 2003] run with an uncorrected threshold of p < 0.01 determined that a 54-voxel extent corrected results to p < 0.05. At p < 0.01, the dmPFC cluster spanned 82 clusters, well surpassing the threshold).  As with the left vlPFC, age-related decreases in connectivity during negative relative to positive event retrieval in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was driven by a signiﬁcant decrease in connectivity during negative event retrieval (r ¼  0.46, p < 0.001; Fig. 5) but not positive event retrieval (p ¼ 0.34). Similarly, the  linear model was signiﬁcant in negative event retrieval only (F(1,61) ¼ 16.53, p < 0.001). The quadratic and cubic elements did not improve model ﬁt for positive or negative events retrieval. Positive event retrieval was associated with signiﬁcantly greater connectivity than negative event retrieval in individuals ages 56e69 years (t(11) ¼ 2.51, p < 0.05), with a trend toward signiﬁcance in the oldest age group (p ¼ 0.055).  4. Discussion  The present study was the ﬁrst to investigate the neural processes supporting positive and negative memory retrieval throughout the adult life span. The results revealed that although there are main effects of valence and age on episodic memory retrieval, there also are interactions between the factors, with many effects of advancing age depending on the valence of information being retrieved from memory. Speciﬁcally, although healthy aging was associated with increased prefrontal activation during retrieval  J.H.

The use of a life span approach also emphasized both continuities and discontinuities across the adult life span. Although the main effects of age appeared to reﬂect a gradual change, with no abrupt shift from a “young adult” pattern to an “older adult” pattern, several cases of age-by-valence interactions in both activity and connectivity were driven by opposite patterns in the oldest and youngest participants. In terms of neural activity, negative valence was associated with increased PFC activity for the oldest individuals and positive valence associated with increased activity for the youngest individuals. Valence-related effects on PFC-MTL connectivity also differed as a function of age and again were driven primarily by differences between the youngest and oldest participants. Speciﬁcally, during negative event retrieval, the PFC and MTL were positively correlated in the youngest participants but were negatively correlated in the oldest participants. These ﬁndings extend prior research by demonstrating that age-related changes in prefrontal recruitment and connectivity differ depending upon the  valence of memory retrieved and demonstrate the insights to be gained from using a full life span sample.  experience  (Pasupathi  in emotional  Prior studies with continuous age designs suggest that agerelated changes and Carstensen, 2003) and emotional memory (Carstensen and TurkCharles, 1994) may occur gradually over time; however, other research suggests that older adults may be qualitatively different from young and middle-aged adults (Charles et al., 2003). In addition, Gruhn et al. (2010) found that happiness, contentment, and surprise demonstrate a U-shaped pattern, such that these emotions were experienced more by young and older adults than middle-aged individuals. Similarly, sadness was experienced more by middle-aged participants than young and older adults, exhibiting an inversed U-shaped pattern. Such complex agerelated changes in emotion processing across the life span may help explain the non-linear neural effects identiﬁed in the present study. Future research should be used to determine how experience of particular emotions, and cognitive responses to such emotions, may contribute to unique patterns of neural activity and connectivity in the youngest and oldest adults in our sample.  2778  J.H.

Effects of valence and healthy aging on neural recruitment during episodic retrieval  The present study was speciﬁcally designed to examine the independent and interactive effects of age and emotional valence on episodic memory retrieval. Controlling for age, negative event retrieval was associated with increased activity in bilateral ventrolateral PFC and left posterior hippocampus. Increased posterior hippocampal activation during negative event retrieval is consistent with literature documenting detail-focused processing for negative events (reviewed by Kensinger, 2009a), as previous work has implicated the posterior hippocampus in more local, detail-focused representations relative to the gist-based representations associated with the anterior hippocampus (see Poppenk et al., 2013 for review). Similarly, a recent meta-analysis revealed that the vlPFC activity was associated with objective  measures of recollective memory (Spaniol et al., 2009). These ﬁndings suggest that, regardless of age, initial retrieval of negative events was associated with more speciﬁc item detail than of positive events.  To assess the main effect of age on memory retrieval, the current research took a life span perspective rather than using an extreme age-group design. This study extended the prior literature examining effects of age on retrieval of neutral experiences (Davis et al., 2008) to reveal age-related increases in medial prefrontal activation and decreases in posterior activation during retrieval of emotional events. Of particular interest was the fact that age changes were gradual across age groups, with no distinct point where neural recruitment rapidly transitioned from looking like “young adults” to looking like “older adults.” Such continuous shifts may represent a natural response to neural changes that occur over the course of the adult life span.  J.H.

Key: BA, approximate Brodmann area; L, left; NA, not applicable; R, right.  The present study was also interested in how emotional valence might interact with this natural aging process. Our analysis revealed lateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal regions in which age-related increases were stronger for negative relative to positive event retrieval, suggesting that the presence of negative emotional valence, more so than positive valence, led older adults to engage these regions during retrieval. In addition, our ﬁndings suggest that these age-by-valence interactions were driven by agerelated reversals in valence effects at the most extreme ends of our sample. In other words, the effect of positive valence on neural recruitment appears to be unique to the youngest individuals in the sample, and the effect of negative valence is unique to the oldest individuals. We have previously reported increased prefrontal activation during positive relative to negative event retrieval in a subset of young adults from the current sample (Ford et al., 2014), but the present study extended this ﬁnding by showing that this valence-related effect was unique to the youngest age group, with middle-aged adults showing no valencerelated differences and older adults exhibiting a reversed effect. The age-by-valence interaction in the extreme ends of our sample  is of particular interest when one contrasts this pattern with the more continuous main effect of age.  The current ﬁndings mirror prior research from our laboratory that has revealed age-related reversals during encoding of positive and negative events, but with healthy older adults recruiting prefrontal regions to a greater extent during positive relative to negative events and young adults exhibiting the reverse pattern (Leclerc and Kensinger, 2008). In other words, the present study reveals an age-by-valence interaction at retrieval that is the opposite of the interaction previously found at encoding. Together, these 2 studies suggest that emotional valence inﬂuences age-related changes in memory processes at both encoding and retrieval, but not in the same way. It has been proposed that the age-by-valence interaction at encoding represents age-related changes in selfreferential processing, with older adults more likely to relate positive information to themselves during encoding (Leclerc and Kensinger, 2008). One possibility is that the effect of age at retrieval reﬂects a continued inﬂuence of these differences present during encoding. The items processed in a more self-referential manner may require less prefrontal processing for their retrieval  2780  J.H. Ford et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2770e2784  Fig. 3.

The center of this VOI ( 24,  28,  6; left hippocampus) was selected via an omnibus contrast that identiﬁed regions associated with retrieval (i.e., Hits) of positive and negative events, controlling for age. VOIs were created and deﬁned functionally at the singlesubject level.

Alternatively, the opposite interaction may reﬂect the fact that emotion inﬂuences a different memory process at retrieval.  It has been suggested that older adults are motivated to regulate their emotional state to a greater extent than young adults, potentially altering the way in which they interact with to-beremembered stimuli (Mather and Carstensen, 2005). It is possible that the reversed patterns of activation during positive and negative event retrieval in young and older adults reﬂects a tendency for older adults to preferentially recruit prefrontal regions in an effort to decrease activity in regions involved in negative memory retrieval, reducing the emotional impact of the image. Such shifts would be associated with motivational changes, as opposed to structural or capacity changes, making the age-by-valence interaction more likely. As we discuss next, the PFC-MTL connectivity results support this regulatory interpretation.  4.2. Effects of valence and healthy aging on functional connectivity  When using functional connectivity to examine PFC-MTL interactions, the left hippocampus was selected as a seed region in this analysis, as it was signiﬁcantly active during both positive and negative event retrieval relative to baseline and, therefore, represented a region involved in retrieval of these events. The connectivity analyses revealed that, during both positive and negative memory retrieval, aging was associated with decreased connectivity between the left hippocampus and a widespread network of regions. These ﬁndings suggest an overall decrease in neural connectivity in the memory retrieval network as a function of aging. This reduction could be driven by age-related breakdowns in the structural integrity of the white matter tracts between regions in the network, or by other changes (e.g., in neuronal oscillations) that may affect the ability for disparate regions to act as part of a  J.H.

Interestingly, the relation of the left hippocampus with bilateral vlPFC exhibited a signiﬁcant age-by-valence interaction, where the effect of emotional valence on functional connectivity differed as a function of age and showed a pattern reversal in the youngest and oldest age groups. In this analysis, negative valence led to a stronger positive connectivity relative to positive valence in young adults, but more negative connectivity in older adults.  The vlPFC is involved in voluntary regulation of emotions in a variety of tasks and conditions (see Phillips et al., 2008 for a review). Speciﬁcally, the vlPFC may regulate emotions by guiding retrieval of emotional details and either increasing or decreasing neural activity in limbic regions associated with emotional responses and memory retrieval (Ochsner and Gross, 2005). Such a role suggests that older adults may be recruiting prefrontal regions  during retrieval of negative events to reduce their negative emotion, a pattern consistent with the theory that older adults are motivated to regulate negative emotional states during cognitive tasks (Mather and Carstensen, 2005). Notably, we also saw a cubic effect of age on connectivity during positive event retrieval, driven by increased connectivity in the oldest individuals in our sample. Although preliminary, this ﬁnding suggests that healthy aging is also associated with an increase in MTL-PFC connectivity, as least in the most extreme end of the age range. Increased connectivity during positive event retrieval would also be consistent with the age-related motivation account.  The present study also identiﬁed an age-by-valence interaction in dmPFC-MTL connectivity, although the cluster was below our corrected threshold. The dmPFC has been implicated in both automatic and voluntary emotion regulation (see Phillips et al.,  2782  J.H. Ford et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2770e2784  Fig. 5.

Abbreviation: ROI, region of interest.  2008 for a review). Ochsner and Gross (2007) proposed 2 top-down cognitive control systems that could be involved in emotion regulation. The description-based appraisal system, which involves the dorsomedial and dorsolateral PFC, generates mental representations of affective states and directs reappraisals to regulate emotion. Importantly, the dmPFC is particularly involved in generating an emotional response when one anticipates an emotional event, as might be the case when trying to remember the details of a negative image associated with a neutral cue. It has also been suggested that, because of the lack of direct connections with regions involved in bottom-up appraisal (such as the amygdala), the descriptionbased appraisal system must inﬂuence these responses indirectly. One proposed avenue for such indirect inﬂuence is by inﬂuencing  regions involved in long-term memory, such as the hippocampus, which are directly connected to affective appraisal systems. The results of the present study suggest that older adults use the dmPFC to downregulate hippocampal activity during negative event retrieval, whereas young adults use the same region to increase hippocampal activity in this same condition. Future research is required to examine age-related changes in the potential role of the dmPFC in emotion regulation during emotional memory retrieval.  4.3. Limitations  When examining the behavioral and neural effects associated with emotion and emotional valence, it is important to consider  J.H. Ford et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2770e2784  2783  other potential differences unrelated to the factors of interest. The retrieval cues in the present study were neutral titles that had been paired with positive, negative, and neutral images during encoding. The encoding task required participants to evaluate the appropriateness of each title for the associated image. Although positive and neutral titles were rated as equally appropriate, negative titles were rated as less appropriate, overall, than the other 2 conditions. It is possible that these differences across retrieval cues could lead to differences in memory performance. However, ratings of title appropriateness were not correlated with memory accuracy in the neutral or negative emotion conditions (p > 0.2 for both relations) or with age in any emotion condition (p > 0.5 for all 3 conditions). Negative events were also associated with increased arousal ratings relative to positive events. This confound presents the possibility that the effects we see in the current analysis are being driven by an arousal effect rather than a valence effect. In other words, greater age-related increases in prefrontal regions for negative relative to positive events may reﬂect increased age effects for high relative to low arousal images. To examine this possibility, we conducted an additional analysis in which we examined regions showing greater arousal-related increases in activity as a function of age. Speciﬁcally, we conducted a parametric modulation analysis of increased arousal and identiﬁed regions in which this effect increased with age (Supplementary Table 2). Critically, none of the regions reported in the valence contrast reached signiﬁcance in this analysis, suggesting that increased arousal for negative events.  Finally, as with all studies examining healthy aging,  it is important to consider potential selection biases in our sample. The older adults in our sample were highly educated individuals who have been screened for potential health problems and dementia. In addition, they are older adults who are interested in research and motivated to come to the MR scanner for a 3-hour study session. In the present study, we must also consider the generalizability of the middle-aged adults, as it is often difﬁcult for individuals in this age range to take the time to come into labs for study sessions. As such, it is possible that these ﬁndings do not generalize to all middle-aged and older adults, but rather reﬂect a particular subsample.  5. Conclusions  The current results revealed that aging was associated with increased prefrontal activation in both positive and negative event retrieval, but that this pattern was more widespread for negative memories. Aging also was associated with decreased hippocampal connectivity in a number of neural regions, although in bilateral vlPFC and left dmPFC connectivity was inﬂuenced by the interaction between valence and age. These ﬁndings extend prior research by demonstrating that age-related changes in prefrontal recruitment and connectivity differ depending upon the valence of memory retrieved. The use of a life span approach also revealed both continuities and discontinuities in recruitment and connectivity across the adult life span. Although the main effects of age exhibit a gradual change, with no abrupt shift from a “young adult” pattern to an “older adult” pattern, the activity and connectivity patterns showing age-by-valence interactions were driven by opposite patterns in the oldest and youngest participants. Such ﬁndings suggest that some aging effects are continuous, whereas others may reﬂect discrete shifts in emotional or mnemonic processing in adults of a certain age.

In the current study, we examine the neural organization of mnemonic and response operations with respect to each other within PFC. Stimulus-evoked and sustained functional MRI activity was recorded during performance of a mental calculation task. The presence or absence of mnemonic and response demands was manipulated in a 2 × 2 factorial design with conditions requiring: (1) memory encoding and maintenance (M+); (2) response selection and execution (R+); (3) encoding, maintenance, and response execution (M+R+); (4) neither mnemonic nor response-related processes (M−R−). The first step of the analyses identified PFC voxels exhibiting differential activity during (M+) vs. (R+) trials. Within these voxels, we then examined activity during multiple phases of (M+R+) trials. Greater stimulus-evoked and sustained activity was observed within the anterior extent of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46) during R+ vs. M+ trials. In contrast, greater activity was observed in the posterior extent of dorsolateral PFC during M+ vs. R+ trials. Importantly, both regions were activated during (M+R+) trials. Activity levels during all of these conditions exceeded levels observed during (M−R−) control trials. These results suggest that integrative functions of PFC that allow past information to guide future actions may emerge from communication between discrete subregions supporting mnemonic and response operations.  © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction  Goal-directed behavior requires mnemonic operations that allow for short-term encoding, maintenance, and manipulation of information, referred to as working memory (Baddeley, 1986). In addition, there must be quick access to response operations so that stored goals can be instantiated into action (Quintana and Fuster, 1992, 1999). Many recent models of prefrontal organization have suggested that prefrontal cortex  may perform integrative functions that link mnemonic and response operations in the service of behavioral goals (Quintana and Fuster, 1999; Curtis and D'Esposito, 2003; Wood and Grafman, 2003; Ramnani and Miall, 2004). Yet, very little is known about the functional neural organization of these operations with respect to each other within prefrontal cortex in humans.  Previous studies investigating mnemonic functions of the PFC use delayed-recognition and delayed-response tasks  ⁎ Corresponding author. Fax: +1 215 898 1982.

In these tasks, trials begin with the presentation of the memory array (S1) which is followed by a brief delay interval, and end with presentation of a memory probe item (S2). The subject's task is to determine if S2 is a member of the S1 memory array on that trial. Two key findings in nonhuman primates have been used to support the view that PFC subserves mnemonic functions. First, monkeys with lesions to PFC are impaired during DRT tasks (Funahashi et al., 1993b). Second, specialized cells within PFC are active during delay intervals of spatial DRTs, and different cells code for different spatial locations that are to be maintained (Goldman-Rakic, 1990, 1995). While the power of DRTs is that they allow temporal segregation of maintenance-related activity from S1- and S2-evoked activity, maintenance may not be the only process engaged during the delay interval. For example, in oculomotor DRTs, monkeys are instructed to move their eyes to the position of S1 when S2 is presented at the end of the delay. Delay-interval activity could reflect retrospective maintenance of S1 or prospective response planning to move eyes to the S1 position (Funahashi et al., 1991; Funahashi et al., 1993a,b).  Some neuroimaging studies have attempted to isolate maintenance and response-related delay activity by manipulating when response information is delivered during spatial working memory paradigms (Rowe et al., 2000; Pochon et al., 2001; Curtis and D'Esposito, 2003). Greater delay-interval activity was reported within the posterior extent of dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), corresponding to BA 8 (Petrides and Pandya, 1999), during passive maintenance of spatial information when no response planning was possible. In contrast, greater delay activity was reported within anterior dlPFC, corresponding to BA 46 (Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995), when responses could be prepared vs. when they could not. A similar functional organization of PFC has been observed in single-unit studies in monkeys. Cells within the posterior third of the principal sulcus coded for spatial positions that were to be maintained in working memory even when these locations were incongruent with response locations (Funahashi and Takeda, 2002; Takeda and Funahashi, 2002). In contrast, activity of cells within the anterior extent of the principal sulcus coded for motor response locations (Sawaguchi and Yamane, 1999). Based on this evidence, it has been suggested that while posterior PFC appears to be involved in “simple maintenance”, anterior PFC may be involved in transforming sensory information into a response code. Importantly, the bulk of findings supporting this proposal are limited to studies of spatial working memory (Passingham and Sakai, 2004).  In the current study, we examined the organization of mnemonic and response functions within PFC while subjects performed a mental calculation task in which numbers were the main stimulus class. We tested the hypothesis that the functional organization of delay activity corresponding to mnemonic and response functions within PFC may be invariant across stimulus domains. If so, in the current task, we should observe greater anterior dlPFC delay activity during tasks requiring response processing and greater posterior dlPFC delay activity during tasks requiring maintenance.  The bulk of studies using DRTs to examine the functional organization of PFC emphasize delay activity profiles. Yet, in  addition to delay activity, there is robust evoked activity within PFC during DRTs. Single-unit recording studies report that while evoked activity within some PFC cells is tuned to sensoriperceptual features of memory items, the activity of other cells is tuned to response features (Quintana et al., 1988; Yajeya et al., 1988). Similarly, neuroimaging studies report stimulus-evoked activity within dlPFC that is sensitive to mnemonic demands such as memory load (Rypma et al., 1999; Jha and McCarthy, 2000), as well as response demands such as response conflict, expectancy, and response execution(Huettel et al., 2002; Schumacher et al., 2003; Huettel and McCarthy, 2004). While delay activity may correspond to maintenance and response preparation processes, evoked activity may correspond to stimulus encoding and memory comparison processes (see Rypma et al., 1999 for discussion) and response selection and execution processes. Thus, examination of both delay-interval activity and evoked activity is likely to bolster understanding of the functional organization of PFC.  In the current study, the presence or absence of mnemonic and response demands was manipulated in a 2 × 2 factorial design during a mental calculation task with 4 conditions requiring: (1) memory encoding and maintenance (M+); (2) response selection and execution (R+); (3) encoding, maintenance, and response execution (M+R+); (4) neither mnemonic nor response-related processes (M−R−). The (M+R+) trials were equivalent to standard delayed-recognition trials whereas (M−R−) trials served as control trials requiring only passive viewing of numbers and mathematical symbols. We compared activity profiles during (M+) and (R+) trials to answer three main questions. First, is there an anterior–posterior organizing axis within dlPFC similar to that described in spatial working memory studies? Second, if discrete regions supporting mnemonic and response functions are identified, is process-specific activity present for both stimulus-evoked and delay-interval activity? Finally, are these regions coactivated during multiple phases of (M+R+) delayed-recognition trials?  2.  Results  2.1.  Behavioral results  Behavioral data analysis  2.1.1. Response times (RT) and percent correct measures were entered into analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests with main factors of Condition: (M+), (R+), M+R+, and Solution Type: Correct vs. Incorrect. In addition to ANOVAs, paired t tests were conducted. No main effect of condition was revealed by the ANOVA on either accuracy or RT. In addition, no significant effects were observed during paired tests between (R+) (mean: 95.49%, SD = 0.44), (M+) (mean: 95.83%, SD = 0.06), M+R+ (mean: 98.26%, SD = 0.01) trials. However, paired tests revealed that RTs were significantly faster for (M+R+) (mean: 1061.76 ms, SD = 268.56 ms) relative to each of the other conditions (P < 0.01), but (R+) (mean: 1710.88 ms, SD = 388.01 ms) and (M+) (mean: 1522.02 ms, SD = 311.23 ms) did not differ from each other (P > 0.5).  B R A I N R E S E A R C H 1 0 9 7 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 1 3 3 – 1 4 1  135  2.2.  Neuroimaging results  Stimulus-evoked and delay-interval covariate effect scores were obtained for the contrast (M+) vs. (R+) for correct trials. These scores were entered into separate two-way ANOVAs for each ROI. For the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC), there was no main effect of slice band (1, 2, 3, and 4), or hemisphere (Left, Right), nor was there an interaction between these factors for stimulus-evoked or delay-interval covariates (P > 0.3). For the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), there was a main effect of slice band for stimulus-evoked (F(3,7) = 5.52, P < 0.006) and delay-interval covariates (F(3,7) = 6.25, P < 0.003), but no effect of hemisphere or slice by hemisphere interaction for either covariate (P > 0.7). For the ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), there was no effect of slice band or a slice by hemisphere interaction (P > 0.6) for either stimulus or delay covariate. There was a significant effect of hemisphere for stimulus-evoked activity (F(1,7) = 39.8, P < 0.001) and a near-significant effect of hemisphere for delay-interval covariates (F(1,7) = 5.15, P < 0.07).  Next, effect scores for each covariate were entered into one-sample t tests to determine if the magnitude of effects significantly differed from zero. An effect score of zero indicates that there is no difference between activity levels observed during (M+) and (R+) trials. It is important to note that zero does not indicate that absolute activity levels were near-baseline (i.e. % change score of zero). Activity levels were robust during all experimental conditions of interest which is not surprising given how the functional anatomical ROIs were determined. In fact, stimulus-evoked (P < 0.01) and delayinterval activity (P < 0.05) were greater during (M+), (R+), and (M+R+) trials than Control trials (M−R−) during which neither mnemonic nor response demands were present.  For the dmPFC, a one-sample t test was performed on effect scores for the region as a whole, collapsed across slices and hemisphere since no slice or hemisphere effects were observed in the analyses described above. This result was not significant for either stimulus-evoked or delay-interval covariate (P > 0.4).  For the dlPFC, since scores were found to differ across slices but not hemisphere, effect scores for each slice collapsed across hemisphere were entered into one-sample t tests (see Figs. 1B and C). Slice 1 significantly differed from zero for the stimulus-evoked (P < 0.03) and delay-interval covariate (P < 0.01). Importantly, effect score values were negative indicating that activity in this region was greater during (R+) relative to (M+) trials. In contrast, Slice 4 significantly differed from zero for the stimulus-evoked (P < 0.01) and delay-interval covariate (P < 0.05). In contrast to Slice 1, Slice 4 had a positive mean value indicating the activity was greater during (M+) vs. (R+) trials. Slices 2 and 3 did not significantly differ from zero for either covariate (P > 0.3). A direct paired comparison of effect scores for Slice 1 vs. Slice 4 was significant for both stimulus-evoked (F(1,8) = 8.11, P < 0.03) and delay-interval (F(1,8) = 7.00, P < 0.02) covariates.  For the vlPFC, for which a significant effect of hemisphere was observed, effect scores were collapsed across all slice bands and analyzed separately for the left and right hemispheres. Neither left hemisphere nor right hemisphere effect scores were significantly different from zero for the stimulusevoked or delay-interval covariate (P > 0.5).  Fig. 1 – Regions of interest within dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex were drawn on a slice-by-slice subject by subject basis (A). All regions were indexed relative to the distance from the anterior commissure (AC), which allowed for across-subject comparisons without spatial normalization. Four slice bands within the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus were investigated. (B) The line graph shows normalized parameter estimates for slice bands 1 through 4 within the left and right middle frontal gyrus for the contrast between (M+) and (R+) separately for the Stimulus covariate (B) and the delay-interval covariate (C). Positive values denote greater activity during (M+) relative to (R+) trials, whereas negative values indicate the opposite. Error bars denote standard error of the mean across subjects. These results show that there is an anterior–posterior gradient within dlPFC during stimulus-evoked and delay-interval activity such that anterior regions are more active during trials emphasizing response demands whereas posterior regions are more active during trials emphasizing mnemonic demands. An effect score of zero indicated that no differences in activity were observed across (M+) and (R+) trials. As indicated by the asterisks, mean activity within Slices 1 and 4 significantly differed from zero indicated that activity within these regions was modulated by mnemonic vs. response demands.  136  B R A I N R E S E A R C H 1 0 9 7 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 1 3 3 – 1 4 1  task with numerical stimuli. The anterior extent of the dlPFC was more active during (R+) trials requiring response selection and execution relative to (M+) trials that required memory encoding and maintenance. We also found that posterior dlPFC was more active during (M+) relative to (R+) trials. Importantly, stimulus-evoked and inter-stimulus-interval delays exhibited this pattern. Finally, both anterior and posterior dlPFC subregions were active during S1-evoked, delay-interval, and S2-evoked time periods in (M+R+) trials.  The study design aimed to unconfound mnemonic and response requirements while holding constant the need to perform simple mental calculation across conditions. We isolated mnemonic encoding and maintenance from response requirements in (M+) trials by requiring encoding and maintenance for each stimulus but requiring a response only after the presentation of 6–8 consecutive stimuli. We isolated response selection and execution from mnemonic requirements during (R+) trials by instructing subjects to simply respond once they determined if a mathematical solution was correct and incorrect. The need to mnemonically encode or maintain items was eliminated because each item was to be independently evaluated.  Unlike these conditions, (M+R+) DRT trials engaged multiple processes. S1 required mental calculation and memory encoding of the solution. In addition, S1 served as a temporal cue indicating that a response would be required after a brief delay. However, S1 did not provide information about the specific response to be executed at S2. During the delay, subjects maintained items in working memory and also prepared for an upcoming unspecified action to be executed at S2. At S2, subjects performed mnemonic comparison processes to determine if S2 was a match or nonmatch and executed a corresponding button press. If discrete foci were activated during (M+) and (R+) conditions, we anticipated that during “confounded” DRT trials we would see coactivation of both foci. Indeed, (M+) and (R+) activated the posterior and anterior extent of dlPFC, respectively. In addition, both of these foci were activated during (M+R+) trials. Below we discuss possible explanations for these results.  Numerous studies have reported delay-interval activity within posterior PFC in “simple maintenance” tasks (Courtney et al., 1998; Zarahn et al., 1999; Postle et al., 2000; Rowe et al., 2000). In studies requiring memory for spatial information, activation foci were typically within dorsal regions of PFC, such as BA 8 (Courtney et al., 1998; Sakai and Passingham, 2003). In contrast, during memory for letters, ventral regions, such as inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44), were activated (Sakai and Passingham, 2003). While such a domain-differentiated organization of PFC for verbal and spatial information is well supported for posterior PFC (see Passingham and Sakai, 2004 for review), very few studies have investigated the neural regions supporting maintenance for numerical stimuli— which have been treated as a special class of verbal stimuli (Gruber et al., 2001). In the current study, we observed maximal activity within the posterior dlPFC, specifically middle frontal gyrus (MFG), corresponding to BA 8 (see Petrides and Pandya, 2002), during (M+) conditions emphasizing maintenance of numerical stimuli. It is interesting to note that other studies have reported a correspondence between regions activated during tasks involving spatial stimuli and  Fig. 2 – The bar graph shows percent signal change values for stimulus-evoked and delay-interval activity within the Anterior dlPFC (black bar) and posterior dlPFC (white bar) for the (M+), (R+), and (M+R+) delayed-recognition trials. Error bars denote standard error of the mean across subjects. While (M+) trials robustly activated Posterior but not Anterior MFG, (R+) trials robustly activated Anterior but not Posterior MFG during both stimulus-evoked and delay-interval activity. Importantly, the delayed-recognition trials activated Anterior and Posterior extents of the MFG during S1-evoked, delay-interval, and S2-evoked activity.  Next we examined activity during (M+R+) trials within Slices 1 and 4 of dlPFC which were the only regions demonstrating differential activity across (M+) and (R+) trials. Robust activity was observed within both subregions during S1-evoked activity; delay-interval activity and S2-evoked activity (see % signal change values in Fig. 2). Paired contrasts between (M+) vs. (M+R+) and (R+) vs. (M+R+) did not result in effect scores that significantly differed from zero for S1, delayinterval, or S2-evoked activity (P > 0.12).  Thus, two subregions of the dlPFC were significantly modulated by mnemonic vs. response demands. Whereas the anterior extent (Slice 1) was more active during trials emphasizing response processes, the posterior extent (Slice 4) was more active during trials emphasizing mnemonic encoding and maintenance. Further both subregions were comparably engaged during S1-evoked, delay-interval, and S2-evoked time periods during (M+R+) delayed-recognition trials.  3.  Discussion  In the current study, we examined the organization of prefrontal cortex to determine if discrete subregions of PFC support mnemonic and response operations. In studies of spatial working memory, anterior PFC is activated during response selection, preparation, and execution (Rowe et al., 2000; Pochon et al., 2001; Rowe and Passingham, 2001; Curtis and D'Esposito, 2003). In contrast posterior PFC is activated during mnemonic encoding and passive maintenance of spatial stimuli (for review see Passingham and Sakai, 2004). We observed a similar organization for mnemonic and response functions within PFC during a mental calculation  B R A I N R E S E A R C H 1 0 9 7 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 1 3 3 – 1 4 1  137  simple arithmetic of numerical material, specifically within parietal cortex (Gruber et al., 2001). Consistent with such findings, we observed activation within posterior dlPFC subregions previously reported to support maintenance of spatial information during our presentation of numerical stimuli.  Several studies have reported that response-related processes are supported by activity in anterior dlPFC (Rowe et al., 2000; Rowe and Passingham, 2001; Passingham and Rowe, 2002; Rowe et al., 2002). In the current study, many regions were activated during (R+) trials. Yet, there was more activity during (R+) relative to (M+) trials within the anterior extent of dlPFC. It has been suggested that this portion of dlPFC corresponds to BA 46 (Petrides and Pandya, 1999). While tasks emphasizing response requirements activate BA 46, Passingham and Sakai (2004) have argued that this region subserves transformation and manipulation of information in addition to response-related processes (Passingham and Sakai, 2004). As support, they site studies reporting delayinterval activity within BA 46 in DRTs only when memory load is high. They argue that only high load trials necessitate transformation of information to keep memory traces active. Under high load conditions, for example, subjects are more likely to engage in rehearsal, recoding, chunking, or other mnemonic strategies. In contrast, transformation of information is not necessary and may not enhance memory representation when load is low. In tasks emphasizing response selection and execution, BA 46 may subserve transformation of a sensoriperceptual code to a motoric response code. Perhaps the stimulus-evoked response-related activity observed during (R+) trials in our study reflects subjects transforming their evaluation of each mathematical solution into a response code (e.g., The solution is incorrect so I should press right button). It is interesting to note that when stimuli did not necessitate recoding and could be simply encoded and maintained during (M+) trials, minimal activity was observed within BA 46.  In our study, we observed robust stimulus-evoked and delay-interval activity during (M+R+) trials within anterior and posterior dlPFC. S1 presentation may have initiated memory encoding within posterior dlPFC, and nonspecific response selection within anterior dlPFC. During the delay interval, mnemonic maintenance processes may be subserved by posterior dlPFC, whereas processes related to response preparation and planning may be subserved by anterior dlPFC. Finally at S2, mnemonic comparison processes may be subserved by posterior dlPFC, whereas response execution and/or the transformation of mnemonic codes into motoric responses may be subserved by anterior dlPFC.  In conclusion, there is little debate that PFC is involved in complex cognitive behavior (Koechlin et al., 2003; Wood and Grafman, 2003; Ramnani and Miall, 2004). Nonetheless, the subjective experience of fluid behavior in which past events guide future actions appears to be supported by multiple nodes organized in both a process- and domain-differentiated fashion within PFC (Passingham and Sakai, 2004; Sala et al., 2003). When damage to these nodes occurs, there are corresponding impairments in specific operations and behavior becomes disjointed (Ferreira et al., 1998). While our study investigated the organization of mnemonic and response operations within PFC, other studies have investigated these  operations within parietal cortex (Bunge et al., 2002; Todd and Marois, 2004). Future studies should elaborate on how PFC, parietal cortex, and other brain regions interact to support mnemonic and response organization.  4.  Experimental procedures  4.1.  Experimental methods  Ten healthy volunteers participated (7 female, 3 male; mean age 21 ± 10 years). The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved this study, and each subject provided informed consent. One subject was removed from analyses due to a data recording error. Another subject was removed due to excessive head motion (>2 mm). Thus, results from 8 subjects will be discussed herein. All stimuli were created and presented using E-prime (Psychology Software Tools). During fMRI recording, stimuli were displayed using a Dell Inspiron 4100 laptop, and were projected with an Epson LCD projector onto a screen placed at the subject's feet and viewed through an angled mirror mounted within the head coil. All experimental conditions contained variants of simple mathematical equations similar to those used by Gruber et al. (2001). Four conditions comprised a 2 × 2 factorial design matrix in which mnemonic and response demands were present or absent (see Fig. 3).  Control condition (M−R−)—no mnemonic and no  4.1.1. response demands Each stimulus display contained numbers and mathematical symbols in pseudorandom nonmathematical combinations. Each display was presented for 1.5 s and followed by a 16.5 s inter-stimulus delay interval. A fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen throughout delay intervals during this and all other conditions. Subjects were instructed to passively view each stimulus display and rest their eyes on the fixation cross during delay intervals. Thirty-six stimulus displays were presented across each of two experimental runs in this condition.  4.1.2. Mnemonic condition (M+) The first stimulus display in each trial was an unsolved mathematical equation presented for 1.5 s. Subjects were instructed to solve the equation and maintain its solution in working memory over a 16.5 s inter-stimulus delay interval until the next display appeared. The next display contained another unsolved equation in which one of the operands was replaced with a “#”. Subjects were to mentally substitute “#” with the maintained solution from the previous problem and then solve the equation. Subjects were cautioned to maintain the number only “in your mind—subvocally” during the delay interval. A series of 6–8 equations were presented. At the end of this series of equations, a single number was presented to the right of an “=”. The subject's task was to determine if this number was the correct solution from the previous equation and then make the corresponding response. Each of two experimental runs consisted of three such trials each separated by an 18 s inter-trial interval. Thus, subjects made button-press responses a total of 6  138  B R A I N R E S E A R C H 1 0 9 7 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 1 3 3 – 1 4 1  Fig. 3 – Experimental conditions and timing. The absence or presence of mnemonic and response requirements was varied across four experimental conditions during performance of a mental calculation task. Top row: Control trials (M−R−) did not require subjects to remember or respond during stimulus presentation. Each stimulus display, which contained numbers and mathematical symbols in pseudorandom nonmathematical combinations, was presented for 1.5 s and followed by a 16.5 s inter-stimulus delay interval. Subjects were instructed to passively view each display and rest their eyes on the fixation cross during delay intervals. Mnemonic demands (M+): The first stimulus display in each trial was an unsolved mathematical equation presented for 1.5 s. Subjects were instructed to solve the equation and maintain its solution in working memory over a 16.5 s inter-stimulus delay interval until the next display appeared. The next display contained another unsolved equation in which one of the operands was replaced with a “#”. Subjects were to mentally substitute “#” with the maintained solution from the previous problem and then solve the equation. At the end of this series of equations, a single number was presented to the right of an “=”. The subject's task was to determine if this number was the correct solution from the previous equation and then make the corresponding response. Bottom row: Response demands (R+): each stimulus display contained a solved mathematical equation displayed for 1.5 s and was followed by a 16.5 s inter-stimulus delay interval. The subject's task was to determine if the equation was solved correctly or incorrectly. All equations were simple and required no multiplication or division beyond stored table facts. Mnemonic and response demands (M+R): Each delayed-recognition trial began with an S1 memory array presented for 1.5 s, comprising an unsolved mathematical equation. Subjects were to solve the equation and told to maintain the solution over a 16.5 s uninterrupted S1–S2 delay interval. In addition, they were told to prepare to make a quick and accurate button press at the end of each delay. At the end of the delay, S2 was presented for 1.5 s and provided a solution for the equation to which subjects executed a response. Half of the S2 items were correct solutions and the other half were incorrect.  times during this condition. Importantly, subjects could not predict exactly when a response was required since the number of equations was randomly varied between 6 and 8 across trials. There were a total of 36 stimulus-delay pairs in this condition that required mnemonic encoding and maintenance of a number. On this and all other conditions requiring responses, responses were made by pressing one of two keys on a button box held in the right hand; a left key indicated that the solution was “Correct” and a right key indicated that the solution was “Incorrect”. Correct and incorrect solutions were presented equaprobably and randomly intermixed. Subjects were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.  4.1.4. Mnemonic and response condition (M+R+) This condition was modeled after standard delayed-recognition tasks. Each trial began with an S1 presented for 1.5 s, comprising an unsolved mathematical equation. Subjects were to solve the equation and told to maintain the solution “in their minds—subvocally” over a 16.5 s uninterrupted S1–S2 delay interval. In addition, they were told to prepare to make a quick and accurate button press at the end of each delay. At the end of the delay, S2 was presented for 1.5 s and provided a solution for the equation to which subjects executed a response. Half of the S2 items were correct solutions and the other half were incorrect. The inter-trial-interval (ITI) was 15 s. A total of 36 trials were presented over two runs.  Response condition (R+)  4.1.3. Each stimulus display contained a solved mathematical equation displayed for 1.5 s and was followed by a 16.5 s inter-stimulus delay interval. The subject's task was to determine if the equation was solved correctly or incorrectly. All equations were simple and required no multiplication or division beyond stored table facts. This condition consisted of two runs with 18 stimulus displays in each run for a total of 36 displays.  4.2.  MRI acquisition and processing  Anatomical and functional data were acquired using a 1.5 T GE Signa scanner with a standard head coil. High-resolution axial T1-weighted images were obtained from each subject prior to functional imaging. 124 axial slices consisting of nearisotropic voxels (0.94 × 0.94 × 1 mm) were acquired (254 × 256 × 124 voxel matrix, flip angle = 20°). Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) echo-planar functional  B R A I N R E S E A R C H 1 0 9 7 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 1 3 3 – 1 4 1  139  images (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 50 ms) were acquired axially for all experimental runs. Each brain volume consisted of 30 neighboring 3.8-mm slices, with an in-plane resolution of 64 × 64, yielding a voxel size of 3.75 × 3.75 × 3.8 mm for fullbrain coverage.  4.3.  Behavioral data analysis  Behavioral data were analyzed independently of functional data. Response time (RT) and percent correct measures were entered into separate analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests to determine averages and statistically significant differences as a function of condition.  4.4.  Imaging data analysis  The VoxBo software package (www.voxbo.org) was used for all fMRI analyses. Standard data preprocessing included slicetime correction, six-parameter motion correction (Friston et al., 1995), and conversion of orientation to the coronal plane. Spatial smoothing and spatial normalization were not conducted, as hypotheses were tested in anatomically and functionally defined regions of interest.  The general linear model (GLM) was used to statistically characterize fMRI signal changes observed in the time-series analyses as a series of amplitude-scaled and time-shifted covariates (Fig. 4). This method has been extensively used and thoroughly described elsewhere (Zarahn et al., 1997a,b; Postle et al., 2000). Briefly, changes in BOLD signal were modeled as independent regressors for each stage of each condition of the experimental tasks. A single regressor time-locked to stimulus onset was used to model stimulus-evoked activity (0–3 s following stimulus-onset). The delay interval following stimulus presentation was modeled by 3 regressors at 7 s, 12 s, and 15 s following stimulus-onset. Each regressor was convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). Data were proportionally normalized to account for differences in  Fig. 4 – The time-series presented in this figure is the average percent change in fMRI signal within anterior dlPFC (A) and posterior dlPFC (B) during (M+) (solid line) and (R+) (dotted line) trials. Error bars denote standard error of the mean across subjects. These results graphically depict the significant differences observed between M+ and R+ trials within this region during stimulus-evoked activity (0–6 s following stimulus onset) as well as delay activity (9–15 s following stimulus onset).  mean-signal values, and correct for linear signal drift within scanning runs. Additional nuisance covariates were included to model the intercept and trial-specific baseline shifts. The convolution matrix included a time domain representation of the 1/f power structure (Zarahn et al., 1997a,b) and a filter to remove frequencies above and below the prominent task frequencies. For each subject, normalized effect scores (e.g., beta values; regression weights) yielded by the GLM for the stimulus displays and delay time periods were extracted for each covariate and averaged within each functionally defined ROI (see below). These normalized effect scores served as dependent measures for across-subjects random-effects analyses. Because our hypotheses concerned activity changes specific to stimulus displays and delay intervals, analyses centered on covariates modeling these task periods.  4.5.  Regions of interest (ROI) analyses  Activity was examined within three functionally defined ROIs that were first defined by anatomical boundaries on each subject's high-resolution coronal anatomical images by experienced technicians. ROIs were drawn on left and right superior frontal gyri (SFG), middle frontal gyri (MFG), and inferior frontal gyri (IFG), to correspond to dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral PFC regions, respectively. These regions were drawn over 3 contiguous slices to create 4 discrete slice bands (Fig. 1A: Slices 1, 2, 3, 4). ROIs were indexed by the distance in mm from each subject's anterior commissure (AC) so that summary activation waveforms by slice region could be created across subjects for each region. These prefrontal ROIs ranged from 0 to 45.6 mm anterior to the AC. Slice bands were selected a priori based on regions reported to be activated in previous studies examining mnemonic and response functions within PFC (Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995; D'Esposito et al., 2000; Rowe et al., 2000; Pochon et al., 2001; Rowe and Passingham, 2001; Curtis and D'Esposito, 2003; Sala et al., 2003). Specifically, Slice 1 of the MFG was drawn to correspond to Brodmann Area (BA) 46 whereas Slice 4 of this gyrus was drawn to correspond to BA 8 as suggested in previous studies investigating the correspondence between cytoarchitectonics and anatomical locations guided by the Talairach Coordinate system (Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995).  Next, an ROI was defined as all voxels within these regions that exhibited statistically significant task-related activity (P < 0.05, uncorrected) during any phase of the task. This method of identifying functional-anatomical ROIs has been recently used to examine prefrontal and posterior perceptual activity (Jha et al., 2004; Ranganath et al., 2004). An important aspect of the statistical contrasts used to functionally define ROIs is that they were orthogonal to, and therefore did not bias, the subsequent statistical contrasts conducted.  4.6.  fMRI planned contrasts  BOLD responses were separately analyzed for functional– anatomical ROIs within right and left dorsomedial (dmPFC), dorsolateral (vlPFC) prefrontal cortex for correct and incorrect trials. We modeled our data to independently assess activity associated with stimulus (dlPFC), and ventrolateral  140  B R A I N R E S E A R C H 1 0 9 7 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 1 3 3 – 1 4 1  evoked and delay-interval activity in all conditions. We used a long delay-interval duration (15 s) to ensure that our contrasts of interest regarding delay-spanning activity were uncontaminated by stimulus-evoked activity.  Posterior dlPFC (corresponding to BA 8av and 8ad) has previously been reported to subserve mnemonic encoding and maintenance during delayed-recognition paradigms (for review see Passingham and Sakai, 2004). In contrast, anterior dlPFC (corresponding to BA 46) has been reported to be activated during response selection, preparation, and execution as well as manipulation and transformation of information during working memory (for review see Passingham and Sakai, 2004). We hypothesize that posterior dlPFC would be more active during (M+) trials whereas anterior dlPFC would be more active during (R+) trials. Thus, our primary contrast of interest compared stimulus-evoked and delay-interval activity for (M+) vs. (R+) trials. Separate analyses were conducted on each of the PFC regions (dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral PFC). Within each region, the normalized effect scores were first entered into two-way ANOVAs to determine if the effects significantly differed across slice bands (1, 2, 3, 4) or hemisphere (right vs. left). This analysis allowed us to determine if distinct subregions were maximally activated for different tasks. Once peak-activity regions were identified (with either positive or negative normalized effect scores—see below), effect scores for those regions were entered into one-sample t tests to determine if they significantly differed from zero.  It is important to note that regions whose activity profiles were significantly greater during high mnemonic demand trials (i.e., M+ trials) were predicted to produce normalized effect scores with positive values for the contrast (M+) vs. (R+), whereas regions whose activity profiles were significantly greater during high response demand trials (i.e., R+ trials) were predicted to produce normalized effect scores with negative values for the same contrast. Thus, the direction of the effect scores revealed the condition during which a region was most active. As such, peak activity regions were identified as the slice band with the highest positive value as well as a slice band with the highest negative value for the normalized effect scores. For regions in which there were no significant differences across the (M+) vs. (R+) conditions, normalized effect scores were not predicted to differ from zero, indicating no difference in activity across these two conditions. To be clear, this is not equivalent to concluding that there was no activity in a particular region—rather that there was no differential activity across the two conditions examined in this contrast.  Once (M+)- and (R+)-sensitive peak regions of PFC were identified, activity during discrete phases of (M+R+)-delayedrecognition trials was investigated within those regions. We hypothesized that (M+)- and (R+)-sensitive PFC subregions would be activated during all trial phases of the delayedrecognition trials (i.e., S1-, delay-interval, and S2-evoked activity). This activity might correspond to mnemonic encoding, maintenance, and retrieval within (M+)-sensitive regions and response planning, preparation, selection, and execution within (R+)-sensitive regions. Thus, contrasts comparing activity during (M+) and (M+R+), and (R+) vs. (M+R+) were predicted to result in effect scores not significantly different from zero.

To test the hypothesis that this state might involve dysfunction of selfreferential processing mediated by cortical midline structures, we investigated abnormalities of functional connectivity in these structures in individuals with SCI using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We performed functional connectivity analysis for 23 individuals with SCI and 30 individuals without SCI. To reveal the pathophysiological basis of the functional connectivity change, we performed magnetic resonance-diffusion tensor imaging. Positron emission tomography-amyloid imaging was conducted in 13 SCI and 15 nonSCI subjects. Individuals with SCI showed reduced functional connectivity in cortical midline structures. Reduction in white matter connections was related to reduced functional connectivity, but we found no amyloid deposition in individuals with SCI. The results do not necessarily contradict the possibility that SCI indicates initial cognitive decrements, but imply that reduced functional connectivity in cortical midline structures contributes to overestimation of the experience of forgetfulness.

Introduction  Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) is a clinical state characterized by an individual’s own perception that their cognitive abilities, including memory, are declining; importantly, individuals with SCI do not have overt cognitive deﬁcits and their cognitive performance tends to be within the general normal range.

Epidemiological (Waldorff et al., 2012), clinical (Juncos-Rabadan et al., 2012), electrophysiological (Babiloni et al., 2010), and neuroimaging (Stewart et al., 2011) data suggest that a portion of SCI subjects is already on the path toward a neurodegenerative disease, mostly AD (Reisberg et al., 2008). However, other studies have found little or no correlation between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive impairment (Jungwirth et al., 2004; Slavin et al., 2010), indicating that an individual’s subjective evaluation of his/her cognitive functioning may not provide an accurate appraisal of actual cognitive deﬁcits (Roberts et al., 2009).  The inconclusive results of previous studies may indicate that SCI could be due to various causes. Given that self-overestimation  2146  F. Yasuno et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 36 (2015) 2145e2152  of cognitive disturbance is a major factor inﬂuencing SCI, dysfunction in self-referential processing might contribute to this phenomenon. Converging evidence suggests that self-referential processing is mediated by cortical midline structures such as the ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (Northoff et al., 2006). Therefore, we hypothesized that the resting-state functional connectivity among these regions in the cortical midline structures would be altered in SCI, and thought to underlie these patients’ subjective memory complaints.  To test this hypothesis, we performed region of interest (ROI) seed-based functional connectivity analysis, to investigate the intrinsic neural network related to self-referential processing in individuals with SCI and in those without SCI (nSCI). In addition, to reveal the pathophysiological basis of any observed differences in functional connectivity, we performed magnetic resonancediffusion tensor imaging (MRI-DTI) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the 11C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B ([11C]PIB), and examined the association of white matter connectivity and amyloid deposition with changes in resting-state functional connectivity in SCI.  2. Methods  2.1. Participants  A total of 30 SCI and 38 nSCI individuals were recruited from the psychiatry unit of Osaka University Hospital. Individuals with SCI were included if they met the proposed Reisberg criteria for primary idiopathic SCI (Reisberg et al., 2008). This study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions, and all participants provided written informed consent.  All participants were screened for comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions by means of clinical, physical, and neurological examinations. Cognitive function was assessed according to a standardized battery of cognitive tests, including Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment ScaleCognitive Component (ADAS-Cog), and the Logical Memory I/II subscale from the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-R LM I/II). To be classiﬁed into the SCI or nSCI groups, the individuals had to have normal memory function (scoring above the education-adjusted cutoff on WMS-R LM II, MMSE score 27), absence of signiﬁcant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, and essentially preserved activities of daily living. The education-adjusted cutoff scores of the WMS-R LM II (maximum score ¼ 25) for a deﬁnition of clinically normal with no cognitive impairment are as follows: (1) education years 16, LM II score 12; (2) education years 10e15, LM II score 10; and (3) education years 0e9, LM II score 7.  After the medical examination and cognitive assessment, 7 individuals from the SCI group and 8 from the nSCI group were excluded because of the presence of overt cognitive deﬁcits, and therefore 23 SCI and 30 nSCI individuals were included in the analysis. The presence of subjective memory deﬁcit was evaluated with a standardized questionnaire system based on the everyday memory checklist (EMC) of Wilson et al. (1989). The EMC was translated into Japanese, and was slightly modiﬁed to ﬁt Japanese culture. The EMC has been previously used to assess unawareness of memory impairment (Supplementary Table S1) (Kazui et al., 2003, 2006). The EMC scores for the subjects’ own ratings were analyzed. All individuals in the SCI group had EMC scores greater than the standardized cutoff score of 9.  2.2. Neuroimaging analysis  2.2.1. MR image acquisition  All MRI examinations were performed using a 3-Tesla wholebody scanner (Signa Excite HD V12M4; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an 8-channel phased-array brain coil. T1-weighted images were obtained using a 3-dimensional spoiled grass gradient recalled inversion-recovery sequence, and DT images were acquired with a locally modiﬁed single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence by using parallel acquisition at a reduction (ASSET) factor of 2 in the axial plane. The details are described in previous studies (Matsuoka et al., 2014; Yasuno et al., 2014). T2-weighted images were obtained using a fast-spin echo (TR ¼ 4800 ms; TE ¼ 101 ms; echo train length ¼ 8; ﬁeld of view ¼ 256 mm; 74 slices in the transverse plane; acquisition matrix, 160  160, acquired resolution, 1 mm  1 mm  2 mm). To exclude subjects with signiﬁcant microvascular disease, white matter hyperintensities and lacunar lesions were rated using the Scheltens scale, which is a semiquantitative visual rating scale (Scheltens et al., 1993).  The resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scan images were obtained by capturing 37 transverse slices of 4-mm thickness covering the entire brain with a temporal resolution of 3 seconds, using a T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging pulse sequence (TR ¼ 3000 ms, TE ¼ 35 ms, ﬂip angle ¼ 85, time frames ¼ 88, number of images ¼ 3256; acquisition time ¼ 4 minutes 24 seconds). For resting-state image acquisition, participants were instructed to remain still with their eyes closed and to let their minds wander freely. To reduce blurring and signal loss arising from ﬁeld inhomogeneity, an automated high-order shimming method based on spiral acquisitions (Kim et al., 2002) was used before acquiring DTI and fMRI scans. To correct for motion and distortion derived from the eddy current and B0 inhomogeneity, the FMRIB Software (v.5;//fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) was used.  2.2.2.  Image preprocessing for resting fMRI  Standard image preprocessing methods were conducted using the Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) software (http://www. ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) with the conn toolbox (http://www.nitrc.org/ projects/conn) for functional connectivity analysis. The functional images were corrected for slice time and motion, co-registered with a high-resolution anatomical scan, normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute space, resampled at 2 mm3, and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm3 full-width half-maximum (Friston et al., 1995). In addition, the Artifact Detection Tool (http://www. nitro.org/projects/artifact_detect) was used to measure motion artifacts in all individuals of both groups (mean  SD; nSCI: 0.042  0.008, SCI: 0.047  0.013, p ¼ 0.13). Nonetheless, we controlled for any motion artifacts using realignment parameters detected by Artifact Detection Tool.  2.2.3. Seed region deﬁnition  A series of ROIs were deﬁned on the cortical midline structures (Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004). A mask for the following distinct subdomains of the cortical midline structures was provided by the conn toolbox: the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex (BA11; Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates for the centroid of the ROIs, right and left: 18, 46, 29 and  16, 45,  29); dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC, BA10: 26, 62,  3 and  23, 62,  3); anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, BA32: 11, 34,14, and  8, 33,16); posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, BA31: 14,  45, 35 and  9,  45, 35); and retrosplenial cortex (RSC, BA29:  9,  46, 13 and  6,  45, 13) (Fig. 1A).  2.2.4. Functional connectivity analysis  Following the preprocessing steps outlined in the previous section, the functional images were imported into the conn toolbox  F.

The blood oxygenation level dependent signal data were passed through a band pass ﬁlter (0.009e0.08 Hz). The mean blood oxygenation level dependent signal time course was then extracted from each of the predeﬁned ROIs. The time course for each ROI was then correlated with the time course for each of the other ROIs, allowing for the calculation of a correlation coefﬁcient for each ROI using Pearson’s product-moment calculation. These values were subsequently used for the statistical comparisons between the 2 groups. To reduce the probability of type 1 error, we controlled the false-discovery rate (p < 0.05) for comparisons within the cortical midline structure.  We hypothesized that the resting-state functional connectivity among these regions in the cortical midline structures would be altered in SCI, and underlie these individuals’ subjective memory complaints. To test this hypothesis, a series of ROIs were deﬁned on cortical midline structures, and performed an ROI-to-ROI seedbased functional connectivity analysis in the cortical midline area to compare the intrinsic neural networks related to self-referential processing between the SCI and nSCI subjects.  The results of the ROI-to-ROI analysis were then veriﬁed at the whole-brain level with seed-to-voxel analysis to conﬁrm the observed patterns in the ROI-to-ROI analysis and to reveal the extent  of these patterns inside and outside of the cortical midline area. Using a priori assumptions based on the ROI-to-ROI analysis, we used an uncorrected p-value height threshold of <0.005, with a cluster height of p < 0.05 as the extent threshold for the whole brain. Functional connectivity (Z-values) between the target regions was calculated from the individual correlation maps by setting an 8-mm, spherical volume of interest (VOI) on the peak of the cluster exhibiting a signiﬁcant between-group difference in the seed-tovoxel analysis. Conﬁrmation of the hypothesis that resting-state functional connectivity among regions in the cortical midline structures is altered in SCI would further lead to the hypothesis that such altered connectivity in cortical medial structures might be associated with subjective memory complaints. Therefore, we performed Pearson’s correlation analysis to examine the relationship between the self-rated EMC score and the functional connectivity values showing a signiﬁcant difference between groups in the seed-to-voxel analysis.  2.2.5. DTI analysis  Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were generated from each individual using the FMRIB software, details of which are described elsewhere (Matsuoka et al., 2014). Voxel-based analysis was performed using the SPM8 software. The two-sample t-test was used  2148  F. Yasuno et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 36 (2015) 2145e2152  to compare FA maps between the SCI and nSCI groups. We used an uncorrected p-value height threshold of 0.001, and k ¼ 30 as the extent threshold for the whole brain. The regional FA value was calculated by averaging the FA values for all voxels within the 8-mm-spherical VOI on the peak of the cluster exhibiting a significant group difference in the analysis described in the previous section.  2.2.6. PET acquisition and data analysis  [11C]PIB PET examinations were performed on 17 individuals from the nSCI group and 11 individuals from the SCI group using a Biograph mCT (Siemens, Knoxville, TN, USA). Dynamic emission scan data were acquired in 3-dimensional mode for a period of 70 minutes. A dose of 645  33 MBq [11C]PIB was intravenously injected. The correction of [11C]PIB PET data for partial volume effects was performed with the PMOD software package (PMOD V.3.3; Technologies, Adliswil, Switzerland) (Müller-Gärtner et al., 1992).  The radioactivity concentrations in 6 regions of the brain (the prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum) were obtained using a template-based method for deﬁning VOI (Yasuno et al., 2002). Regional timeeactivity data were analyzed with the Logan graphical method (Logan et al., 1996) from 35 to 70 minutes of the PET data with the cerebellum as the reference region in the PMOD software package. The Logan graphical method has been shown to be stable, with high test-retest reliability (Price et al., 2005) and sensitivity to small changes in 11C-PIB (Lopresti et al., 2005). This method yields binding potential (BP) estimates relative to non-displaceable (ND) binding, which is denoted by BPND (Innis et al., 2007). The global cortical mean BPND value was calculated from individual values of each cortical brain region.  A voxel-based BPND was also estimated using the Logan graphical method (Logan et al., 1996). Spatial preprocessing of maps was performed using SPM (Wellcome Institute of Neurology, University College London, UK). Normalized BP images were smoothed with a Gaussian ﬁlter to 10 mm full-width half-maximum. We performed voxel-based analysis using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with age, sex, and years of education as covariates, on the BPND images between the SCI and nSCI groups. Correlation was assessed between PET and BPND values at each voxel, and the values of functional connectivity for regions showing signiﬁcant group difference were entered as individual covariates of interest. We used an uncorrected p-value height threshold of 0.001 and k ¼ 30 as the extent threshold for the whole brain.  2.3. Statistical analysis  Group differences in demographic characteristics between patients and healthy controls were examined by unpaired t-tests and Pearson’s c2 tests. We performed Pearson’s correlation analysis to examine the relationship between the score of self-rated EMC and the functional connectivity values, showing a signiﬁcant difference between groups in the seed-to-voxel analysis. Correlation was assessed between the DTI-FA in the regions showing a signiﬁcant difference between groups and the functional connectivity showing a signiﬁcant difference between groups in the seed-to-voxel analysis. Global cortical mean PIBBPND values of the SCI and nSCI groups were compared using ANCOVA, with age, sex, and years of education as covariates. Since the presence or absence of amyloid-b (Ab positive or negative) is also meaningful to evaluate the effect of AD pathology on SCI (Johnson et al., 2013), we chose the global cortical mean PIB-BPND > 0.25 (n ¼ 4) as the cutoff point for the determination of Ab-positive status (Amariglio et al., 2012). The group differences of the PIB-BPND values in the regions exhibiting a signiﬁcant group  Table 1 Demographic statistics and neuropsychological performance of cognitively normal individuals with subjective cognitive impairments (SCI) and those without SCI (nSCI)  nSCI 30 16/14 72.2  4.8 12.5  2.7 33.1  2.4 5.3  2.6 29.3  1.0 3.6  1.5 24.0  4.5 19.3  5.0  Characteristic/test No. Sex, M/F Age, y Education, y RCPM Self-rated EMC MMSE ADAS-Cog WMS-R Logical memory I: immediate Logical memory II: delayed Data are mean  SD.

All statistical tests were 2tailed and reported at a < 0.05. Bonferroni correction was applied to avoid type 1 errors because of the multiplicity of statistical analyses. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS for Windows 22.0 (IBM Japan Inc, Tokyo, Japan).  3. Results  3.1. Demographics  As shown in Table 1, there were no signiﬁcant differences in age, gender, education level, and the scores of RCPM (range: 28e36), MMSE (27e30), and ADAS-Cog (0.7e8.0) between the SCI and nSCI groups. Individuals with SCI had a signiﬁcantly higher delayed memory score of WMS-R LM II, compared with those of nSCI. We found no subjects with signiﬁcant microvascular disease, and there was no signiﬁcant difference (t ¼ 0.19, p ¼ 0.85) in the Scheltens scale scores (Scheltens et al., 1993) between the SCI (1.3  1.5; maximum score ¼ 5) and nSCI (1.4  2.0; maximum score ¼ 7) groups.  3.2. Between-group ROI-to-ROI and successive seed-to-voxel analysis  Results from the between-group ROI-to-ROI analysis in the cortical midline structures are shown in Fig. 1B and Table 2a. Compared with the nSCI group, the SCI group exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced connectivity in the following ROI pairs: rRSC-lDMPFC, rRSC-rACC, lRSC-rDMPFC, lRS-r&lDMPFC, and lRSC-r&lACC.  Whole-brain connectivity from the right and left RSC was also assessed. Fig. 1C and Table 2b show the between-group contrasts. Consistent with the ROI-to-ROI results, signiﬁcantly reduced connectivity between the RSC and bilateral cortical medial structures of the DMPFC and ACC was conﬁrmed. We found substantial mean connectivity strength (Z-values) only in the nSCI group, reﬂecting a signiﬁcant difference between groups in connectivity, except for that between the rRSC and cluster #3, in which the Z-values for the connection in both groups were close to zero.  3.3. Correlation between functional connectivity and EMC score/ subjective memory complaints  Higher EMC scores correlated with more reduced functional connectivity between the rRSC and cluster #2 (r ¼  0.40, p ¼ 0.003)  F.

In addition, there were no signiﬁcant differences between BPND values in the regions of the left SLF and CG, where we found a signiﬁcant change in FA, in both groups. There was no signiﬁcant correlation between the BPND value at each voxel and the individual value of the functional connectivity of the seed-target regions showing a signiﬁcant group difference.  3.4. FA changes and its correlation with functional connectivity  4. Discussion  Our results revealed signiﬁcantly lower FA of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) at the left external capsule and higher FA in the left cingulum (CG) near the hippocampus in SCI subjects compared with nSCI subjects (Fig. 3A). We found no signiﬁcant relationship between the LM I/II score and FA values of the SLF and CG.  We found a signiﬁcant positive correlation between the SLF-FA and functional connectivity of the left RSC and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (cluster #4, r ¼ 0.45, p ¼ 0.001), and negative correlations between the CG-FA and functional connectivity of (1) the right RSC and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (cluster #2, r ¼  0.37, p ¼ 0.006), (2) the left RSC and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (cluster #4, r ¼  0.49, p ¼ 0.0002), and (3) the left RSC and anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex (cluster #7, r ¼  0.44, p ¼ 0.001) (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S3).  3.5. PIB-BPND and its correlation with functional connectivity  We found no signiﬁcant difference in global cortical mean PIBBPND values between the SCI and nSCI groups (BPND adjusted for age, sex, and years of education: SCI ¼ 0.20  0.16, nSCI ¼ 0.14  0.17; F1, 23 ¼ 0.95, p ¼ 0.34). There were 3 Ab-positive (BPND > 0.25)  This is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate that individuals with SCI have reduced functional connectivity between the RSC and other cortical midline structures of the DMPFC and ACC. In addition, the reduced functional connectivity between these regions correlated well with higher subjective memory complaints determined by the self-rated EMC score. DTI-FA analysis revealed a signiﬁcant decrease of FA in the left SLF, and an increase of FA in the left CG. The functional connectivity of RSC and cortical midline structures of DMPFC/ACC showed signiﬁcant positive and negative correlations with the FA in the left SLF and left CG, respectively.  Meta-analysis showed that the less functionally connected brain regions of the RSC, DMPFC, and ACC in SCI are all involved in selfreferential processing (Northoff et al., 2006); in particular, posterior cortical midline structures, including the RSC, are implicated in integrating self-referential stimuli in the context of one’s own viewpoint. Axonal tracing studies in monkeys have revealed that the RSC has reciprocal connections with the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal region, and the RSC is most likely to be involved in hippocampus-dependent functions within the PCC (Kobayashi and Amaral, 2003, 2007). The RSC also has reciprocal pathways to the prefrontal cortex, which provide an indirect route connecting the hippocampal regions and dorsolateral prefrontal  2150  F.

There are also reciprocal links with the anterior cingulate cortex (Morris et al., 1999). It has been proposed that the RSC transforms allocentric representations into egocentric ones, and vice versa (Vann et al., 2009). The hippocampus indexes the location that is embodied in an autobiographic memory, scene, or imagined event, and the RSC then translates this information into an egocentric representation so that the memory, scene, or imagined event can be viewed from a subjective, egocentric viewpoint (Burgess et al., 2001; Byrne et al., 2007). In other words, the RSC translates the objective representations of daily experience into a subjective, self-referential representation in the context of one’s own viewpoint.  On the contrary, anterior cortical midline structures, including the ACC and DMPFC, are considered to be involved in the monitoring and evaluation of a self-referential stimulus (Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004). The ACC has been associated with monitoring and control functions such as response selection and inhibition, conﬂict monitoring, error detection, and performance monitoring (Bush et al., 2000; Carter et al., 1998; Devinsky et al., 1995; Paus, 2001). A variety of cognitive and emotional tasks revealed increased activity in the ACC to self-referential stimuli compared with non-selfreferential stimuli (Frith and Frith, 1999), and the monitoring function of the ACC is associated with a preference for self-referential stimuli. Likewise, subjects that were required to monitor and judge under conditions where auditory verbal feedback was their own or that of another person showed activation in the DMPFC (McGuire et al., 1996). Greater DMPFC activation was observed during evaluation of self-referential statements compared with memory retrieval trials (Zysset et al., 2002). The DMPFC was speciﬁcally activated during a self-referential evaluation task in which subjects had to judge whether positive or negative personality trait adjectives described themselves accurately (Fossati et al., 2003).  The reduction in functional connectivity between the posterior cortical midline structures of the RSC and the anterior cortical midline structures of the ACC and DMPFC might contribute to dysfunction in self-referential processing. In particular, the subjective, self-referential representations of the daily experience of benign forgetfulness translated from the objective representations in the RSC cannot be efﬁciently and correctly monitored and evaluated in the ACC and DMPFC because of the fewer functional connections between these areas. As a result, individuals with SCI tend to incorrectly overestimate their experience of forgetfulness in spite of the lack of objective evidence.  Functional connectivity measures are thought to reﬂect the sum of both direct and indirect synaptic connections between neural hubs (Dunn et al., 2014; Greicius et al., 2009; Sperling et al., 2010). The SLF is composed of long bundles of neurons connecting the front and the back of the cerebrum. In our study, the decrease of white matter connections in the SLF manifested as reduced functional connectivity between the RSC and ACC/DMPFC. On the contrary, this reduction in functional connectivity was related to an increase in white matter connectivity in the CG. From the viewpoint of memory function, the PCC/RSC has been identiﬁed as a key member of the posteromedial memory system that underlies the processing of “contextual” memory cues. The posterior medial system interacts with an anterior medial system, which processes the contents of episodic memory. The hippocampus is proposed to facilitate information transfer between the anterior and posterior medial memory systems, acting as a “dynamic integrator” of episodic memory (Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012). The increase in white matter connectivity in the CG near the hippocampus might facilitate the role of the hippocampus and compensate for the decreased functional connectivity between the 2 systems because of the reduction in white matter connectivity in the SLF in the SCI group.  PET-amyloid imaging was conducted only in a subgroup of the enrolled subjects, namely 15 nSCI subjects among the 30 enrolled patients and 13 SCI subjects among the 23 enrolled patients. Previous studies with larger samples suggested a role of Ab in SCI (Amariglio et al., 2012; Perrotin et al., 2012; Rowe et al., 2010; Visser et al., 2009), which indicated the possibility that SCI is a very early at-risk period in the continuum of the dementia due to AD (Reisberg and Gauthier, 2008). Our results do not necessarily contradict the possibility that SCI indicates initial cognitive decrements because of AD pathology. However, the results of this study do suggest the existence of other factors related to SCI and raise questions about the pathophysiology underlying the functional and white matter disconnection in SCI. Whether the cognitive changes in SCI are innate or acquired, and ﬁxed or progressive remain unknown. Therefore, longitudinal studies with larger samples that explore the evolving nature of other pathological features will be required to resolve these issues.  Of particular note, the SCI group showed a signiﬁcantly higher LM II delayed recall score compared with the nSCI group. However, this does not imply that nSCI individuals have some cognitive decline/deﬁcits. From the standardized data in the Japanese version of the WMS-R, the mean LM II score of nSCI subjects (19.3/50) was equivalent to the 87th percentile of the 70 to 74-year-old group, while that of SCI subjects (23.2/50) was equivalent to the 90th percentile of the same group. Individuals of both the nSCI and SCI groups showed good memory ability. Therefore, the lack of subjective memory complaints in nSCI individuals with good memory function cannot necessarily be considered to result from an individual’s inability to recognize their own memory deﬁcits.  In summary, our study demonstrates that individuals with SCI have less functional connectivity between the RSC and other cortical midline structures, namely, the DMPFC and ACC. This might contribute to the overestimation of their experience of benign forgetfulness, because of dysfunction of self-referential processing. A reduction in white matter connection was shown to be related to less functional connectivity, but we found no relationship between amyloid deposition and reduced functional and white matter connections in SCI subjects. Our results do not necessarily contradict the possibility that SCI indicates initial cognitive decrements, but they do indicate that reduced functional connectivity in cortical midline structures contribute to SCI. Further studies are needed to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SCI.  Disclosure statement  The authors have no conﬂicts of interest to disclose.

Self-referential processing generally reﬂects self-concept in diﬀerent domains. Cortical midline structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), are critical for self-referential processing both in healthy controls and depressive patients. However, the role of subregions of the MPFC in self-referential processing in depression remains uncertain. In this study, we aimed to explore the neural basis of self-referential processing in depressive patients and the activation-deactivation patterns of subregions of the MPFC. Nineteen depressive patients and 21 controls completed the classic self-referential task with two diﬀerent judgement conditions: self-referential processing and semantic processing. In the self-referential condition, with analysis of the two sample t-test unipolar patients showed signiﬁcantly higher activation of the central MPFC and signiﬁcantly lower activation of the dorsal MPFC, relative to controls. The results substantially suggested that the diﬀerent activation of the MPFC may be selectively involved in self-referential processing in depressive patients, potentially indicating abnormal engagement of cognitive control and emotion regulation in this group.  1. Introduction  Depression is an aﬀective disorder characterized by emotional, cognitive, and behavioural dysfunction. Depressive mood, negative cognitive biases, and behavioural withdrawal interact with each other, and this interaction helps maintain depressive symptoms (Beevers, 2005). Depressive patients can be characterized by multiple selfabnormalities including ruminations, self-blame, and increased association of their self with negative emotions (Grimm et al., 2009a; Ingram, 1990; Northoﬀ, 2007b; Rimes and Watkins, 2005; Treynor et al., 2003). Clinically, these abnormalities of the self may be subsumed under the concept of increased self-focus (Ingram, 1990; Northoﬀ, 2007a). Self-focus may be operationalized in social neuroscience as the extent to which one engages him- or herself in selfreferential processing (Lemogne et al., 2009a). Self-referential processing concerns the appraisal of stimuli as strongly related to one's own person (Northoﬀ et al., 2006a). Numerous studies have found that depressive patients remember negative stimuli encoded self-referentially better than positive stimuli (or either type of stimuli encoded in  reference to others) (Banos et al., 2001; Bradley and Mathews, 1983; Derry and Kuiper, 1981; Dobson and Shaw, 1987).  Processing of self-referential stimuli in cortical midline structures (CMS) is a fundamental component of generating a model of the self. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies with self-referential tasks in healthy participants have consistently demonstrated that the core brain regions involved are the cortical midline structures (CMS): the medial orbital prefrontal cortex (MOFC), the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), the sub/pre- and supragenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC, SACC), the medial parietal cortex (MPC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the retrosplenial cortex (Gillihan and Farah, 2005; Northoﬀ et al., 2006b). The MPFC and PCC are components of the default mode network (DMN) (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Raichle et al., 2001). They exhibit a higher level of neural activity during resting state than during externally oriented tasks (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Raichle et al., 2001). They elicit smaller signal decreases during self-referential processing compared to the larger signal decreases observed during non-self-referential proces ⁎ Correspondence to: Department of Psychology, Southwest University, 2, Tiansheng Street, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China.

Previous studies have indicated that explicit self-reference preferentially engaged dorsal MPFC, rest preferentially engaged precuneus, and intuition-based social self-reference preferentially engaged ventral MPFC, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens (Lieberman et al., 2004; Whitﬁeld-Gabrieli et al., 2011). These results suggest that MPFC exhibit a high level of neural activity and could be involved in selfreferential processing, especially in the MPFC with social property.  For depressive patients, some recent fMRI studies suggest that functional alterations of CMS play a role in mediating the relationship between aberrant self-referential thinking and negative aﬀect (Grimm et al., 2009b; Mor and Winquist, 2002; Yoshimura et al., 2010). These studies indicate that CMS activity might be associated with the negative cognitive bias towards the self commonly observed in depressive patients. The CMS region most frequently associated with aberrant activity is the MPFC (Grimm et al., 2009b; Lemogne et al., 2011b, 2009a, 2010; Northoﬀ, 2007c; Yoshimura et al., 2010). The MPFC is central to the neural networks impaired in depressive patients (Drevets et al., 2008; Mayberg, 2003). Moreover, both increased (Yoshimura et al., 2014) and decreased (Grimm et al., 2009b; Johnson et al., 2009) activation of the MPFC have been reported in depressive patients (Fitzgerald et al., 2008). To further investigate activation of the MPFC, a consistent deﬁnition of the subregions of the MPFC is necessary. Based on previous evidence (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Johnson et al., 2006; Ochsner et al., 2005), we deﬁned the ventral MPFC as z < −10, the central MPFC as −10 < z < 27, the dorsal MPFC as z > 27 as encompassing the ACC (y > 10). Although the MPFC is clearly activated during self-referential processing in healthy subjects (Morel et al., 2014; Northoﬀ et al., 2006b), the activation-deactivation pattern in the MPFC may diﬀer in depressive patients. Johnson et al. (2009) found lower activation both in the ventral and central MPFC in depressive patients compared to controls in the analytical self-referential condition (Johnson et al., 2009). Lemogne et al. (2009b) observed greater activation in the dorsolateral PFC and ventral MPFC for both depressive patients and controls during self-referential processing (Lemogne et al., 2009b). In addition, Yoshimura et al. found increased activation in the dorsal MPFC (Yoshimura et al., 2010). Additionally, in contrast to controls, both increased (Johnson et al., 2009) and decreased (Grimm et al., 2009b) activation of the PCC/Precuneus were observed in depressive patients. Moreover, MPFC activation during self-referential processing was reported to be negatively correlated (Grimm et al., 2009b; Renner et al., 2015), not correlated (Johnson et al., 2009; Lemogne et al., 2009b), or positively correlated (Yoshimura et al., 2010) with the severity of symptoms in depressed patients. The relationship between the role of self-reference processing in the psychopathology of depression and the role of subregions of the MPFC in its pathophysiology have yet to be explored.  Previous studies have employed various self-referential  tasks, incorporating positive/negative pictures (Grimm et al., 2009b), personality traits (Lemogne et al., 2009b; Yoshimura et al., 2010), or analytical/experiential conditions (Johnson et al., 2009), as well as control tasks (e.g., passive viewing tasks, semantic tasks, or distraction conditions; Grimm et al., 2009b; Yoshimura et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2009) to investigate the self-reference eﬀect in depressive patients, including those receiving psychotropic medication. Thus, there was a need to provide more evidence clarifying the role of the subregions of the MPFC in the pathophysiology of depression across a variety of patients. In the present study, we used the classical selfreferential task with fMRI to explore the neural bases of self-reference processing associated with unipolar depressive patients. Based on previous studies (Grimm et al., 2009b; Johnson et al., 2009; Lemogne et al., 2009b; Northoﬀ et al., 2006b), we hypothesized that, compared to healthy controls, unipolar depressive patients would display aberrant activation of CMS brain regions, especially subregions of the MPFC, during self-referential processing. Speciﬁcally, we predicted that the ventral, central, and dorsal MPFC might perform  Table 1 Demographics and clinical features.

The ﬁndings may expand our understanding of the diﬀerential functions of MPFC subregions.  2. Methods  2.1. Participants  Nineteen depressive patients (15 females, mean age 26.17 ± SD 5.58 years) were recruited from the First Aﬃliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Twenty-one healthy control (HC) participants (9 females，mean age 26.17 ± SD 5.58 years) were recruited from the local community. Participants were between 18 and 60 years of age and group-matched based on age. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. Patients with a history of neurologic illness, alcohol or substance abuse, electroconvulsive therapy, or transcranial magnetic stimulation within the last 2 years were excluded from the current study. The psychiatrists conﬁrmed a primary diagnosis of unipolar depression according to the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV criteria (SCID; First et al., 1995). Exclusion criteria for healthy controls included severe head trauma, colour blindness, learning disabilities, current panic disorder, psychotic symptoms, and alcohol or substance abuse within the past 6 months and without a DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis or ﬁrst-degree relatives with an Axis I diagnosis. All the depressive patients were outpatients having received some treatment. The details on the drugs administered are addressed in the supplementary materials. All participants were right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Severity of depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al., 1961) ( BDI > 14).  Participants were paid for participating in the clinical assessments and neuroimaging scan. Prior to the study, all participants provided written informed consent, which was approved by the Institutional Human Participants Review Board of Southwest University Imaging Center for Brain Research.  2.2. Experiment task  The study was a mixed 2 (group: depressive patients or HC)×2 (condition: self-referential or semantic processing) ×2 (valence: positive or negative) design. The task involved one practice run performed outside the scanner and one scanning run. Participants were presented with 60 personality trait words, either positive (e.g., “competent”) or negative (e.g., “incapable”). There were two diﬀerent judgement conditions: self-referential processing and semantic processing. In the self-referential condition, participants judged whether each trait described them. In the other-referential condition, subjects judged whether the trait was socially desirable. Two conditions were alternately shown to avoid presenting the same condition in two consecutive trials. In all conditions, subjects gave a “yes” or “no” response for each word by pushing a button with the right or the left thumb, respectively. Each trial started with a ﬁxation crosshair displayed for 500 ms followed by an instruction cue which was presented for 1000 ms.  9  Y. Li et al.  Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 263 (2017) 8–14  for residual motion confounds. No subjects showed excessive head motion (translation﹥2 mm or rotation﹥2°).  2.6. Imaging data analysis  After pre-processing, the four regressors from each run (i.e., self/ positive, self/negative, sematic/positive, and sematic/negative) were modelled to create the design matrix, and for each subject, all the four runs were modelled in one general linear model (GLM). We have selected the onset of the stimulus (personality adjectives and response “yes” or “no”) as the onset time point and the RT as the duration of the event. They were convolved with the Canonical Haemodynamic Response Function, and the six realignment parameters for each subject were also included as confounding factors. And a baseline condition by the ﬁxation crosshair interstimulus interval was created in the ﬁrst-level. The following individual contrast images were obtained for the HRF estimates: self-positive vs. ﬁxation, self-negative vs. ﬁxation, sematic-positive vs. ﬁxation, sematic-negative vs. ﬁxation.  In the second-level, we performed an ANOVA with one group factor and two within-groups factors (i.e., condition and valence). The ANOVA analysis used the ﬁrst-level individual contrast images by applying the frontal mask. However, there was no group-related interaction. Based on previous studies (Grimm et al., 2009a; Lemogne et al., 2009a), self-referential processing in depressive patients changed relative to healthy controls and played a key role in the formation of depression. Consequently, although there was no group-related interaction, we separately examine the eﬀects of each condition between the two groups using a two-sample t-test to exploit the potential diﬀerences in self-referential processing between patients and controls. All statistical outcomes were set at an initial voxel-level threshold of P=0.005. Then the results were corrected using small volume corrections, applying a frontal mask, and cluster-level familywise error (FWE) corrections at P < 0.05 for multiple comparisons. The mask contained superior frontal, middle frontal, inferior frontal, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, which were merged using the AAL template developed for SPM at Wake Forest University (WFU-pickAtlas) (Lancaster et al., 2000) (http://www.fmri.wfubmc.edu).  Fig. 1. Self-reference task procedure.  Then, another ﬁxation crosshair was displayed for 500–1000 ms, followed by the presentation of an adjective. The second ﬁxation crosshair and adjectives were displayed for a total of 2000 ms. Finally, a black screen was displayed for 2500 or 4500 ms (Fig. 1). When the adjective appeared, participants were instructed to respond by pressing a keypad as soon as possible, while also maintaining accuracy. Pressing “1” indicated that the adjective describes the self or is positive; pressing “4” indicated that the adjective did not describe the self or is derogatory.  2.3. Behavioural data analysis  Behavioural statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 (Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences) with a level of signiﬁcance of p < 0.05. For reaction time (RT), we performed a one group factor (patients vs. controls) and two within-groups factors (self-referential vs. semantic and positive vs. negative) three-factor analysis of variance during self-referential and semantic conditions. For the number of “yes” responses during the self-referential condition, we also performed a one group factor (patients vs. controls) and one within-groups factor (positive vs. negative) three-factor analysis of variance.  2.4. fMRI data acquisition  3. Results  Images were acquired with a Siemens 3T scanner (Siemens Magnetom Trio TIM, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12-channel phasedarray head coil at the Southwest University Brain Imaging Center, Beibei, China. An Echo-Planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used for data collection, and 432 T2*-weighted images were recorded per run (TR=2000 ms; TE=30 ms; ﬂip angle=90°; FOV=220×220 mm2; matrix size=64×64; 32 interleaved 3 mm-thick slices; in-plane resolution =3.4×3.4 mm2; and inter slice skip =0.99 mm). High-resolution T1weighted images were recorded with a total of 176 slices at a thickness of 1 mm and in-plane resolution of 0.98×0.98 mm2 (TR=1900 ms; TE=2.52 ms; ﬂip angle=9°; and FOV=250×250 mm2).  2.5. Imaging data pre-processing  We used SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK, http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm8) to pre-process the functional images (Friston et al., 1994). After being visually inspected for the quality of image control, slice timing was used to correct slice order. The data were realigned to estimate and modify the six parameters of head movement, and the ﬁrst six images were discarded to achieve magnet-steady images. Then, these images were normalized to MNI space in 3×3×3 mm3 voxel sizes. The normalized data were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel; the full width at half maximum (FWHM) was speciﬁed as 8×8×8 mm3. Temporal high pass ﬁltering (0.01 Hz) was performed to reduce the eﬀect of low frequency drift, and the 6 motion parameters were regressed to account  3.1. Participant characteristics  The characteristics of demographic variables of the study sample are shown in Table 1. The two groups did not diﬀer in age (P > 0.05) but diﬀered in gender (P < 0.05). As expected, patients had signiﬁcantly higher scores on BDI (P < 0.05) compared to healthy controls.  3.2. Behavioural data  We performed ANOVAs with one group factor (patients vs. controls) and two within-groups factors (self vs. sematic and positive vs. negative). Regarding the RT during self-referential and semantic conditions, there was a main eﬀect of group (F =37.26, P < 0.05) with patients having slower responses than controls. A main eﬀect of valence was also observed (F=29.98, P < 0.05) with slower responses for negative words versus positive words. In addition, there was a group×condition×valence interaction (F=5.12, P < 0.05). That is, compared to controls, patients were slower to respond to negative words in the self-referential condition (F=13.95, P < 0.05).  Regarding responses during the self-referential condition, we performed an ANOVA with one group factor (patients vs. controls) and one within-groups factor (positive vs. negative). There was a group×valence interaction (F=365.49, P < 0.05). Then the post hoc ttests showed that patients make less “yes” response for positive words (F=192.70, P < 0.05) and make more “yes” response for negative words (F=129.54, P < 0.05) compared to controls. That is, compared to  10  Y. Li et al.  Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 263 (2017) 8–14  Fig. 2.

Activation analysis  factors  (i.e.,  condition and valence) was  A second-level ANOVA with one group factor and two withingroups conducted. Unfortunately there was no group-related interaction. Therefore, to elucidate the change of patients’ self-referential processing, we performed a two-sample t-test to compare patients vs. controls under the self-referential condition. To identify signiﬁcant clusters, the threshold was set at p﹤0.005, and then we used small volume corrections as well as family-wise error (FWE) corrections for multiple comparisons with a rate of 0.05. The results showed that patients had signiﬁcantly greater activation in the left central MPFC (t=4.42, MNI coordinate: −9 60 6, Fig. 2). There was signiﬁcantly lower activation in the left dorsal MPFC (t=−2.65, MNI coordinate: −9 15 42, Fig. 3) and pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area, t=−2.64, MNI coordinate: 42 12 30, see Table 2 for details). Moreover, we performed t-test comparing two groups in semantic condition. Only the bilateral Triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus survived after small volume FWE corrected at p < 0.05 (see the Supplementary materials for details).  To address the possibility that there was a change in patients within personality trait words during self-referential processing, we compared patients and controls in the processing of positive words in the selfreferential condition. As a result, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in activation after multiple comparisons. Additionally, we compared patients vs. controls for processing of negative words in the selfreferential condition and found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence after correction for multiple comparisons. Introducing gender, age, and educational level as covariates yielded similar results.  4. Discussion  This study aimed to identify the subregions of the MPFC involved in excessive self-focus in unipolar depressive patients using a classical  11  self-referential paradigm. Behaviourally, patients showed slower responses for negative words in self-referential vs. semantic conditions and associated positive words with themselves less often than negative words. These results indicated that relative to healthy controls, patients had a negative self-concept, which has also been observed in previous ﬁndings (Lemogne et al., 2011a). In addition to providing evidence that further clariﬁes the functions of diﬀerent subregions of the MPFC, our ﬁndings provide new evidence that diﬀerent areas of the MPFC may be diﬀerentially implicated in self-referential processing. As noted in the introduction, activity in various regions of the MPFC has been associated with self-referential processing (Grimm et al., 2009b; Johnson et al., 2006; Lemogne et al., 2011a; Renner et al., 2015). For patients vs. controls undergoing self-referential processing, an increase in the activity of the central MPFC was found, while a decrease in activity of the dorsal MPFC was also observed. Furthermore, these MPFC-diﬀerences were not observed under sematic processing between groups. However, groups did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly in selfreference vs. semantic processing or positive vs. negative word comparisons. These results suggest that the central MPFC and dorsal MPFC may play diﬀerent modulatory roles in unipolar depressive patients during self-referential processing.  The central MPFC may provide information about the role in emotional activity and emotional regulation in unipolar depression. Elevated central MPFC activation is assumed to represent automatic aspects of self-referential processing (Yoshimura et al., 2010). It is proposed to maintain representations of aﬀective and motivational states implicating in the excessive self-focus (Johnson et al., 2006; Mitchell et al., 2005; Northoﬀ and Bermpohl, 2004; Ochsner et al., 2005). Moreover, the central MPFC plays a role in the integration of emotional and cognitive processes by incorporating emotional biasing signals and markers into decision-making processes (Bechara et al., 1994; Damasio, 1994; Elliott et al., 2000). Anatomically and functionally, the central MPFC is aﬃnitive with subcortical components of the reward system (Öngür and Price, 2000), which is involved in various cognitive processing, cognitive appraisal of emotion. Importantly, unipolar depressive patients were in cline to dysphoric  such as  Y. Li et al.  Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 263 (2017) 8–14  Fig. 3.

Therefore, the central MPFC performed increased activation when unipolar depressive patients associate themselves deeply with emotional words following the increased self-focus of a persistent, repetitive and self-critical nature (Nejad et al., 2013) in self-referential processing which consuming them much cognitive resources compared to controls. As a result, there is a possibility that the activation of central MPFC provide an adequate explanation for the neural basis of self-reference eﬀects. Unipolar depressive Patients might preferentially engage activity of the central MPFC, relative to controls, and this activity might be involved in cognitive-emotional regulation during self-referential processing.  In contrast to the central MPFC, we observed decreases in activation of the dorsal MPFC during self-referential processing in patients vs. controls. The dorsal MPFC has often been observed to show reduced neural activity during cognitively demanding tasks in depressive patients (Downar and Daskalakis, 2013; Fitzgerald et al., 2008;  Mayberg, 2003; Phillips et al., 2003). Anatomically, the dorsal MPFC covers the dorsal section of the prefrontal cortex, including the middle parts of the superior and medial frontal gyrus. Functionally, the dorsal MPFC is involved in the evaluation of self-referential stimuli (Fink et al., 1996; Greene and Haidt, 2002; McGuire et al., 1996), but it represents strategic aspects of self-focus (Phillips et al., 2003) and maintains more symbolic representations in describing and reasoning about these self-reﬂective states compared to the central MPFC (Maddock et al., 2003). Consistent with our ﬁndings, previous neuroimaging studies in depressive patients have reported decreased neural activity during predominantly cognitive or cognitive-emotional tasks (Fitzgerald et al., 2008; Mayberg, 2003; Phillips et al., 2003). Relative to healthy individuals, depressive patients were demonstrated to show reduced executive recruitment of dorsal MPFC in response to response inhibition task (Nixon et al., 2013). Moreover, the dorsal MPFC may be recruited during the voluntary control of mood (Phillips et al., 2003), which may be applicable in self-referencing tasks with mentalizing similar others (judging how pleased the target person was) (Mitchell et al., 2005) and monitoring of self-relatedness. These processes may be crucial for self-reﬂection. Based on our data, we would posit that, compared to healthy controls, unipolar depressive patients may have poor voluntary control of emotion and lower conﬂict monitoring.  Of note, there are some limitations in our study which should be acknowledged. First, although the central MPFC and dorsal MPFC did not show up in the group comparison under sematic condition, we should not neglect the fact that main results came from the two sample t-test. Consequently, our data still need more suitable control condition and suﬃcient theoretical bases arise from other processes. Second, the lack of neural responses to negative stimuli in patients vs. controls could be due to the limitations of mixing negative and positive words in the provocation paradigm based on the event-related design. This may be insuﬃcient for estimating the eﬀect of negative variance in the BOLD signal. Previous research has found signiﬁcant MPFC activity under a negative self-referential condition, when positive and negative stimuli were presented in separate blocks (Yoshimura et al., 2010). What is more, diﬀerences in the duration of depression across patients  12  Y. Li et al.  Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 263 (2017) 8–14  may inﬂuence self-referential eﬀects, such as the response to negative words. We also remain unable to exclude types of processing other than self-related processing in the perception condition. Moreover, the selfreferential and sematic conditions were mixed in the same block, and consequently, the subjects made eﬀorts to constantly switch between the two conditions. Because of this, the self-referential eﬀects might have been attenuated. It would be better to divide the self-referential and sematic conditions into two independent blocks. Finally, to examine the self-memory eﬀect, a memory task could be administered after the fMRI. It is important to emphasize that the words were processed diﬀerently in the two conditions.  In conclusion, our study provides evidence for altered neural activity in subregions of the MPFC during self-referential processing in unipolar depressive patients. Diﬀerences in the activation of the central MPFC (representation) and dorsal MPFC (cognitive monitoring) in the self-referential condition indicate that these subregions of the MPFC serve somewhat diﬀerent functions during self-focus. The present ﬁndings further our understanding of MPFC function, suggesting distinct roles for diﬀerent subregions of the MPFC in the pathophysiology of depression. The activation-deactivation pattern reported here may be a critical marker of psychopathology in subclinical depressive patients. Further follow-up studies are needed to explore the role of the diﬀerent subregions of the MPFC, especially in psychotherapy.

The AI has also been linked to risky decision-making under acute stress. However, it is yet unknown how naturalistic sleep habits aﬀect risky decision-making and AI activity when individuals feel stressed. In the current study, a daily diary approach was used to document participants' daily stress. Adolescents and adults reported their recent sleep duration and completed two fMRI visits during which they performed a risky decision-making task: once each when they endorsed a high and low level of stress. Results revealed that, regardless of age, individuals who reported receiving more sleep took fewer non-advantageous risks during high stress relative to those who reported receiving fewer hours of sleep per night while sleep duration was not associated with risky behavior under low stress. Among individuals who reported less sleep, those who exhibited reduced AI activation during risk-taking under high stress also took more disadvantageous risks whereas this eﬀect was attenuated for those who reported longer sleep duration. Moreover, longer sleep duration was associated with greater functional coupling between the AI and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) under high stress whereas sleep duration was not associated with AI-DLPFC functional coupling under low stress. These ﬁndings suggest that naturalistic sleep duration may amplify the eﬀects of daily stress and alter risky decision-making behavior through interactions with the AI.  1. Introduction  The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults and adolescents attain 7–9 h and 8–10 h of sleep per night, respectively (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 35% of adults and over 60% of high school students receive less than the recommended duration of sleep (CDC, 2011; Kann et al., 2014). Individuals who receive poor sleep are at an increased risk for physical and psychological health problems (Vgontzas et al., 2004) and exhibit deﬁcits in learning and memory (Walker and Stickgold, 2006) and behavioral inhibition (Anderson and Platten, 2011; Telzer et al., 2013). Neurocognitive deﬁcits give rise to increased risk-taking and poor decision-making (Harrison and Horne, 2000; Killgore et al., 2006, 2011). Extensive research in adults has shown that sleep loss leads to similar biological outcomes as those induced by stress and ampliﬁes physiological responses to stress (Balbo et al., 2010; Spiegel et al., 1999; Vgontzas et al., 2004). For example, sleep-deprived adults have higher baseline cortisol levels and increased cortisol response to  psychosocial stress relative to well-rested individuals (Minkel et al., 2014); this physiological response to stress appears to occur via enhanced limbic reactivity and diminished amygdala-prefrontal connectivity (Anderson and Platten, 2011; Yoo et al., 2007). It is likely that sleep loss may also amplify the eﬀects of acute stress on risky decisionmaking. Given how often individuals generally experience stress, how prevalent insuﬃcient sleep is, and how many decisions individuals are required to make daily under these conditions, it is surprising that these relationships have never been examined together in adults or in adolescents. The goal of the current study was to investigate how average sleep duration might moderate the relationship between daily stress and risky decisions.  In adults, acute stress alters neural activation of mesolimbicprefrontal circuitry, including the striatum, anterior insula (AI), and prefrontal (PFC) regions (Kogler et al., 2013; Pruessner et al., 2008) through cortisol-related increases of dopamine release in the ventral striatum and PFC (Pruessner et al., 2004; Ungless et al., 2010). These neural changes enhance reward salience and lead to greater rewardbiased decisions coupled with decreased sensitivity to punishment and  ⁎ Correspondence to: University of California, 1285 Franz Hall, Box 951563, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, United States.

Uy, A. Galván  Neuropsychologia 95 (2017) 119–129  altered strategy use during decision-making (Porcelli and Delgado, 2009; Putman et al., 2010; Starcke and Brand, 2012; Starcke et al., 2008). For example, stressed individuals who exhibited greater increases in cortisol chose options that could potentially lead to high reward but actually led to high punishment more often (Starcke et al., 2008). Another study reported that participants under acute stress took more risks in a loss domain versus gain domain (Porcelli and Delgado, 2009), suggesting that stress may decrease sensitivity to punishment. Using risky decision-making tasks in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Lighthall et al. (2012) found that acute stress enhanced dorsal striatum and AI activation during decision-making in adult males. AI activation was positively correlated with reward collection rate, which was one of the adaptive strategies that optimized earnings (Lighthall et al., 2012), suggesting that the AI may play a role in adaptive risk-taking under stress.  Research examining the eﬀects of acute stress on risk-taking in adolescents has been limited. Previous work from our lab examined how daily stress aﬀects adaptive risky decision-making in adolescents and adults (Uy and Galván, 2016). Using a within-subjects daily diary approach to measuring daily stress and an adaptive risky decisionmaking task, we showed that adolescent males (15–17 years of age) took more advantageous risks under high relative to low stress whereas adult males (25–30 years of age) took fewer non-advantageous (equal expected value) risks under high relative to low stress. Moreover, despite showing similar sensitivity to expected value, adolescent males demonstrated increased overall risk preference under high stress relative to adult males while there were no developmental diﬀerences in risky decisions under low stress conditions (Uy and Galván, 2016). These developmental diﬀerences in stress-related risky behaviors were paralleled by developmental diﬀerences in stress-related functional activation in the PFC during adaptive risky decision-making such that adolescent males evinced reduced PFC activation during high relative to low stress when making advantageous decisions (relative to disadvantageous decisions) whereas adult males showed no stress-related changes in PFC recruitment (Uy and Galván, 2016). Moreover, decreasing PFC activation under stress was related to greater nonadvantageous risks under stress, suggesting that the developing PFC may be more sensitive to the eﬀects of stress.  information to maximize  fMRI studies investigating the eﬀects of sleep deprivation on ﬁnancial risky decision-making in adults have shown that sleep deprivation is associated with increased risk-taking for gains and decreased loss-avoidance behavior as a result of diminished use of expected value expected outcomes (Libedinsky et al., 2011; Menz et al., 2012; Mullette-Gillman et al., 2015). Individuals who were sleep deprived also showed reduced AI activation and increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation when making decisions about losses and gains, respectively, compared to when they were well rested (Venkatraman et al., 2007, 2011). Decreasing AI activation was related to less loss-minimizing behavior while increasing vmPFC activation increased gain-maximizing behavior (Venkatraman et al., 2011). In other words, sleep loss appears to bias individuals to be more motivated to seek positive outcomes than to avoid negative outcomes.  The AI integrates aﬀective and cognitive states (Bechara et al., 1997; Bechara and Damasio, 2005; Werner et al., 2013) and is involved in emotional decision-making and reward expectation (Mizuhiki et al., 2012). It is sensitive to expected value (Droutman et al., 2015; Weller et al., 2009) and plays a critical role in adaptive decision-making (Preuschoﬀ et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2011). During adolescence, the AI undergoes ongoing maturation (Shaw et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2014). The connectivity strength between the AI and PFC continues to increase with age (Fair et al., 2007) whereas connectivity between the AI, striatum, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) reaches adult-like strength by adolescence (Stevens et al., 2009). These developmental diﬀerences contribute to the underlying immature cognitive control and heightened reward sensitivity in adolescents relative to adults,  biasing them towards risky decisions. Indeed, on a risky decisionmaking task, adolescents exhibited reduced AI activation compared to adults during risk-taking, which was thought to reﬂect immature integration of aﬀective and cognitive information related to the consequences of their decisions (Eshel et al., 2007). Additionally, in adolescents (14–16 years of age), Telzer et al. (2013) found that poor sleep quality was associated with reduced functional coupling between the AI and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) during reward processing, which predicted greater risk-taking. These ﬁndings suggest that, in addition to functional activation of the AI alone, stronger functional coupling between cognitive and aﬀective systems via the AI might underlie more mature/rational risk-taking behavior, and that the strength of functional coupling between these systems in the context of risk can be inﬂuenced by sleep.  Taken together, evidence suggests that poor sleep and acute stress may alter risky decision-making by undermining optimal regulation of reward-biased risk-taking behavior through modiﬁcations of the insular cortex, prefrontal cortex, and/or functional coupling between the two regions in both adolescents and adults. Given that sleep loss and acute stress act on similar neural and physiological systems to alter risky decision-making and that these systems under signiﬁcant maturation during adolescence, it is important to investigate how poor sleep might interact with daily stress to amplify the eﬀects of acute stress on risky decision-making in both adolescents and adults.  The current study aimed to determine how naturalistic sleep loss (via self-reported sleep duration) aﬀects risky decision-making and AI activity when individuals feel stressed (relative to when they do not feel stressed). Given the diﬀerential eﬀects of sleep loss and stress on gains versus losses as well as advantageous versus non-advantageous risky decision-making, participants performed an adaptive risky decisionmaking task (the Cups Task) that diﬀerentiated between these types of risky choices. We were also interested in examining whether sleep duration was related to self-reported perceptions of riskiness, perceived beneﬁts of risks, and the likelihood to take risks in the real world. Based on previous research, we made the following predictions: 1) individuals who reported receiving fewer hours of sleep per night would take more non-advantageous risks (perhaps more so in the context of potential gains) under high stress while sleep duration may not aﬀect risk-taking under low stress (i.e., sleep×stress interaction); 2) individuals would activate the AI when taking risks and those who exhibited reduced AI activation during risk-taking under high stress would take more non-advantageous risks; 3) the relationship between AI activation and non-advantageous risks under stress would be more pronounced in individuals who reported shorter sleep relative to longer sleep; 4) we predicted that the interaction between sleep duration and daily stress on non-advantageous risk-taking would be exaggerated in adolescents relative to adults (i.e., an age×sleep×stress interaction). Regarding real-world risk-taking, we predicted that individuals who reported fewer hours of sleep would report greater perceived beneﬁts from a number of risks and greater likelihood to take risks in the real world. Previous studies have found gender diﬀerences in the eﬀects of acute stress on risky decision-making (e.g., Lighthall et al., 2012; Lighthall et al., 2009; Putman et al., 2010; Uy and Galván, 2016), and the ﬁndings thus far have been rather inconsistent. We do not have any speciﬁc predictions regarding gender; therefore, gender was included as a covariate in the current study.  2. Method  2.1. Participants  Twenty-two adolescents (14 females) between 15 and 17 years of age (M=16.55, SD=.67) and twenty-two adults (12 females) between 25 and 30 years of age (M=27.27, SD=1.72) participated in the study. Participants were recruited through advertisements on the UCLA campus, surrounding neighborhoods, and local online classiﬁeds and  120  J.P. Uy, A. Galván  Neuropsychologia 95 (2017) 119–129  forums. Participants were excluded if they had any metal objects in their bodies (e.g., braces, permanent retainers), a diagnosis of a psychiatric or developmental disorder, claustrophobia, were lefthanded, or were pregnant. Informed consent was obtained from all adult participants; parental consent and assent was obtained from all participants under the age of 18 in accordance with procedures approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) was administered to estimate IQ. Adolescents and adults did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer in IQ (t(42) =−.868, p=.390) or ethnic composition (Χ2(5, N=44)=5.524, p=.355). Socioeconomic status (SES) was determined by participant’s maternal level of education. Recent stressful life events (SLE) was determined by participant’s self-reported number of stressful life experiences in the past 6 months on a Life Events checklist (e.g., death of close family member, begin new school, change in living conditions, breakup with signiﬁcant other, etc.). Adolescents and adults did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer in SES (Χ2 (6, N=44)=6.210, p=.400), or in the number of recent SLE, (t(42)=.411, p=.683).  2.2. Materials  2.2.1. Sleep patterns questionnaire  Sleep duration was determined by participants’ self-reported response to the following question during the ﬁrst visit of the study: “On average, how many hours have you slept per night in the past month?”. This question serves to capture a naturalistic depiction of individuals’ recent habitual sleep duration and allows us to investigate how this average “baseline” sleep duration reported at the time of study enrollment might inﬂuence subsequent reactivity to stress. Selfreported sleep duration has been shown to be moderately correlated (r=.45) with objective sleep measures obtained using actigraph watches (Biddle et al., 2015; Cespedes et al., 2016; Lauderdale, 2008), making this measure a suitable measure of recent habitual sleep duration. Furthermore, self-reports of sleep duration via questionnaire have also been shown to be moderately reliable with both daily diary (r=.61) and actigraph (r=.53) methods in adolescents (Short et al., 2012; Wolfson et al., 2003). Sleep duration ranged from 5 to 10 h per night (M=6.84, SD=1.26). Adolescents reported sleeping an average of 6.75 h per night (SD=1.45). Adults reported sleeping an average of 6.93 h per night (SD=1.08). There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in sleep duration among age (p=.641) and gender groups (p=.757). However, because of the diﬀerence in NSF-recommended sleep duration, this would imply that more adolescents are sleeping less than their recommended 8-h minimum (n=15) than adults are sleeping less than their recommended 7-h minimum (n=9). A Chi-square test revealed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the distribution of individuals who reported receiving insuﬃcient sleep between adolescents and adults (X2(1, N=44)=3.30, p=.069).  2.2.2. Domain-speciﬁc risk-taking scale  Participants completed the Domain-Speciﬁc Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT; Figner and Weber, 2012), a well-validated 40-item measure of one's perceived risk of, expected beneﬁt of, and likelihood of engaging in risky events in the following domains: ethical, ﬁnancial, health/safety, recreational, and social. Age-appropriate versions of the DOSPERT for adults and adolescents (ages 14–17) were administered based on participant age. For example, the adolescent version of the DOSPERT investigates ethical risk-taking by asking participants to consider “dating someone else's boyfriend or girlfriend” while adults are asked to consider “having an aﬀair with a married man or woman.” The DOSPERT uses a 7-point Likert scale for each subscale (“not at all risky” to “extremely risky” for perceived risk, “no beneﬁts at all” to “great beneﬁts” for expected beneﬁts, and “extremely unlikely” to “extremely likely” for likelihood of risk engagement). Self-reported ratings on each subscale were averaged across domains to create mean composite scores for perceived risk, expected beneﬁt, and likelihood of engaging in risky events.  2.2.3. Cups risky decision-making task  The Cups Task (Levin and Hart, 2003; Levin et al., 2007) measures decision-making under uncertainty, as individuals often make decisions under uncertain conditions. The Cups Task has been used in previous fMRI studies to study the neural correlates of risky decisionmaking (Xue et al., 2009, 2013). Participants were presented with two task frames (Frame): a frame where they had the opportunity to gain money (Gain Frame, n=54 trials), and one where they could lose money (Lose Frame, n=54 trials). Depending on the frame, participants were asked to choose between a certain gain (or loss) and an uncertain gain (or loss). The neutral terms “certain” and “uncertain” were used during explanation of the task to participants to prevent suggestion of any connotations or biases that might be associated with the terms “safe” and “risky”, respectively, which are used throughout the report. The certain option was to win (or lose) $2, while the uncertain option led to a probability (20%, 33%, or 50%) of either a larger win (or loss) ($4, $6, or $10) or no win (or loss). The certain option consisted of one ﬂipped-over cup with $2 written underneath it, indicating to participants that there is a 100% chance of gaining (or losing) $2. In the uncertain option, the number of cups varied between two (50%), three (33%), and ﬁve (20%) cups, and the amount indicated underneath each set of cups varied between $4, $6, and $10. There were three trial types (n=36/trial type) that diﬀered in expected value (EV=value×probability). The advantageous EV trials (ADV), in which the EV was greater than $2 in the gain frame or less than $2 in the lose frame, consisted of the 50%-$6, 50%‐/$10, and 33%-$10 trials in the gain frame and 33%-$4, 20%‐/$4, and 20%-$6 trials in the lose frame; in these trials, the uncertain choice yielded better EV than the certain choice. The disadvantageous EV trials (DIS), in which the EV was less than $2 in the gain frame and greater than $2 in the lose frame, consisted of the 33%-$4, 20%‐/$4, and 20%-$6 trials in the gain frame and the 50%-$6, 50%‐/$10, and 33%-$10 trials in the lose frame; in these trials, the uncertain choice yielded worse EV than the certain choice. In the equal EV trials (EQEV), in which the EV was $2, consisted of the 50%-$4, 33%‐/$6, and 20%-$10 trials in both gain and lose frames; in these trials, the uncertain choice yielded the same EV as the certain choice. Participants were instructed to consider each choice carefully and to earn as much money as possible in the game because at the end of the game, the computer would randomly select an outcome based on their decisions and that outcome would be added to or subtracted from their study compensation. Participants did not actually lose any money; this information was not disclosed to participants until after completion of the study. Thus, participants could earn between $2 and $10 in addition to study compensation. All participants completed two 7-min runs (n=108 total trials) of the task during each stress visit for a total of four 7-min runs across both stress visits (n=216 total trials) (Fig. 1).  The percentage of risks taken on the Cups Task for each trial type was calculated by counting the number of times participants chose the risky option of each trial type divided by the total number of trials presented of each trial type, multiplied by 100. The trial types were as followed: Gain ADV (ADV trials in Gain frame), Gain EQEV (EQEV trials in Gain frame), Gain DIS (DIS trials in Gain frame), Lose ADV (ADV trials in Lose frame), Lose EQEV (EQEV trials in Lose frame), Lose DIS (DIS risks in Lose frame). Percentages of risks taken for each trial type were calculated for each stress visit and were used as dependent variables in data analysis.  2.3. Procedure  Each participant was enrolled in the study for two weeks. After providing consent, participants completed questionnaires and received instructions regarding the study procedures. Participants provided salivary cortisol samples at the beginning and end of the intake visit to assess baseline physiological stress response to the novel, laboratory setting. Salivary cortisol is a commonly used indicator of an organism’s  121  J.P. Uy, A. Galván  Neuropsychologia 95 (2017) 119–129  it  baseline stress rating (or a 1-point increase in stress rating if baseline rating was relatively high (i.e., 5 or greater; n=0 participants)). Similarly, low-stress state was determined when participants endorsed stress ratings that were at least one standard deviation below their baseline stress rating (or a 1-point decrease in stress rating if baseline rating was relatively low (i.e., 2 or lower; n=4 adolescents, 2 adults)). After a high-stress state or low-stress state was determined, participants were asked to visit the laboratory in the late afternoon of the same day. Since the stress conditions were driven by participant responses, true experimenter-controlled counterbalancing of whether participants’ ﬁrst scan was for low or high stress was not possible in this study design. However, due to the random sampling of the days and participants, turned out that exactly 50% (n=22) of our participants (and 50% from each age group [n=11]) completed their low stress scan before their high stress scan while the other 50% completed their high stress scan before their low stress scan. Scan order was included as a covariate in all behavioral and fMRI analyses. The average duration between the start of the study and the ﬁrst scan was 5.84 days (SD=2.53). The average duration between the ﬁrst scan and the second scan was 6.27 days (SD=2.11). There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in duration between adolescents and adults (p > .4). At each stress visit, salivary cortisol was collected before participants underwent an fMRI scan to assess physiological response to stress as close in time to stressor onset as possible. Duration between reported stress (stressor) and brain scan ranged from 30 min to 5 h and 30 min (M=2 h and 7 min, SD=1 h, 6 min). Duration did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer by stress state (p=.263), age group (p=.729), or gender (p=.555). Average stress rating for high stress reported via textmessage was 4.20 (SD=1.53) while average rating for low stress was 2.20 (SD=1.18). Participants also reported stress ratings when they arrived for the fMRI scan. Average stress rating upon arrival was 4.42 (SD=1.44) for high stress and 2.47 (SD=1.27) for low stress scan. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between ratings reported at text and those reported upon arrival for the scan, which suggests that the stress state was sustained. Stress ratings reported upon arrival for the scan were used for analyses, as they were closer in time to the scan and may reﬂect a more accurate assessment of participants' stress state at the time of the scan. During each visit, participants underwent an fMRI scan while performing the Cups Task.  Fig. 1. Schematic of Cups Task. Each stimulus was presented for 1500 ms. After stimulus presentation, participants are asked to choose between the certain (left) side or the uncertain (right) side (Cue). Once participants made their decision, a jittered interstimulus-interval (ISI) was shown for 500–1500 ms followed by outcome presentation (Outcome) for 1500 ms.  response to stress and reﬂects activity of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis (Hellhammer et al., 2009).  2.3.1. Daily stress assessment  Daily stress was assessed using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA; Bolger et al., 2003) method, a procedure in which participants were contacted daily through smartphones and reported daily ratings of subjective feelings of stress. A smartphone was available from the lab to participants who did not have a cellular phone and/or a text-messaging plan. However, all participants in the study used their personal cellular phones. The EMA method has been shown to be successful at capturing naturally occurring stress (Almeida et al., 2009; Galván and Rahdar, 2013; Galván and McGlennen, 2012). In the current study, participants were randomly text-messaged three times per day between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. (the average time for each contact was as follows: 11:25 a.m.contact 1 , 2:23 p.m.contact2, 5:00 p.m.contact 3) over the span of 2 weeks and were asked to indicate the level of stress they experienced in the last hour using a Likert scale (1=not stressed; 7=very stressed).  2.3.2. Baseline assessment  2.4. MRI data acquisition  During the ﬁrst three days, each participant's baseline composite stress rating was determined by averaging the stress ratings provided via text messages throughout the day across the three days (average baseline stress rating=3.02, SD=.90). Concurrently, during the ﬁrst two consecutive days, participants collected salivary cortisol via passive drool at home (releasing saliva into tube through a straw) to evaluate each participant’s baseline diurnal cortisol pattern. Participants were instructed not to eat or drink anything at least 30 min prior to collection and to collect 1 mL of saliva at awakening, 30 min postawakening, at 4:30 p.m., and at 8:30 p.m. using Salivette® test tubes (Sarstedt, Germany) and to store the samples in their freezers until their next scheduled laboratory visit. The average time between participants’ ﬁrst saliva collection and when participants returned samples was 5.84 days (SD=2.53). This method and timing of salivary cortisol collection has been shown to be standard and reliable (Clements, 2012). All participants returned completed sets of saliva samples. All samples were stored at −20 °C in a laboratory freezer at UCLA until time of shipment. Salivary cortisol analyses were conducted as described by Strahler et al. (2010).  2.3.3. Stress visits  Two subsequent laboratory visits were categorized into high-stress and low-stress visits based on stress ratings relative to baseline stress ratings. High-stress state was determined when participants endorsed stress ratings that were at least one standard deviation above their  Functional imaging data were collected on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio MRI scanner using a gradient-echo, echo-planar image (EPI) sequence (TR: 2 s, TE: 30 ms, ﬂip angle: 90°, 271 volumes, 34 slices, slice thickness: 4 mm). A T2-weighted, matched bandwidth (MBW), highresolution anatomical scan and magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) scan were acquired for registration purposes (TR: 2.3, TE: 2.1, FOV: 256, matrix: 192×192, sagittal plane, slice thickness: 1 mm, 160 slices). The orientation for the MBW and EPI scans was oblique axial to maximize brain coverage. E-prime software was used for task presentation.  2.5. Image preprocessing and registration  Preprocessing and statistical analyses were performed using FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL) 5.0.9 (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Preprocessing included motion correction, non-brain matter removal using FSL brain extraction tool (BET), spatial smoothing (5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and ﬁltered in the temporal domain using a nonlinear high-pass ﬁlter (100s cutoﬀ). All data reported are from scans with ≤2 mm in translational movement. EPI images were registered to the MBW scan, then to the MPRAGE scan, and ﬁnally into standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (MNI152, T1 2 mm) using linear registration with FSL FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT).  122  J.P. Uy, A. Galván  Neuropsychologia 95 (2017) 119–129  2.6. Functional neuroimaging data analysis  One general linear model (GLM) with multiple regressors (stimulus presentation, decision response, and outcome) was used for fMRI analyses. Regressors were created by convolving a delta function representing the onset time of each event with a canonical (double gamma) HRF. Onset time for the stimulus presentation regressor was deﬁned as the onset of the stimulus for each trial with no duration. Onset time for decision response event was deﬁned as the onset of the cue presentation for each trial with reaction time as the duration. Onset time for outcome event was deﬁned as the onset of the outcome presentation of each trial with no duration. For each participant, each stress visit, and each run, ﬁve explanatory variables were modeled: 1) all stimuli presentations; 2) all risky (uncertain) choices; 3) all safe (certain) choices; 4) all outcome presentations, and 5) missed/invalid trials. Six motion parameters were modeled as events of no interest in the GLM. Temporal derivatives were included as covariates of no interest. Inter-trial and inter-stimulus interval ﬁxation points were not explicitly modeled and therefore served as an implicit baseline.  fMRI analyses focused on participant choice (risky or safe) for high stress scans and low stress scans. To examine the eﬀects of risk-taking, the following contrasts were modeled for each run: 1) risky choice (relative to implicit baseline); 2) safe choice (relative to implicit baseline); 3) risky choice > safe choice; and 4) safe choice > risky choice. A ﬁxed eﬀects voxel-wise analysis combined each of two runs for each stress visit for each participant at the second level.  2 (Stress)×2 (Age)×2 (Gender) repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted at the group level using the FMRIB local analysis of mixed eﬀects (FLAME1) module in FSL with and without sleep duration (mean-centered) entered as a regressor in the model. Given our a priori hypotheses regarding the role of the anterior insula, a region-of-interest (ROI) mask for bilateral anterior insula was anatomically localized and deﬁned using masks from FSL's Harvard-Oxford atlas. Z (Gaussianized T) statistic images were threshold using the ROI mask, determined by Z > 2.3 and a corrected cluster signiﬁcant threshold of p < .05 using Gaussian Random Field theory. Tests were corrected for family-wise errors (FWE).  2.7. Psychophysiological Interaction (PPI) Analyses  Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses (Friston et al., 1997) were conducted to examine whether functional coupling between the anterior insula and subcortical and prefrontal regions was 1) aﬀected by stress, 2) modulated by sleep duration, and/or 3) predicted risky behavior in adolescents and adults. The seed region for the PPI analyses was deﬁned as the area in the anterior insula that was activated during risk-taking and was aﬀected by stress. The seed region was ﬁrst transformed into the functional space of each participant using FLIRT in FSL, and the deconvolved time-series was extracted for the ROI. The ﬁrst-level design for each run consisted of three regressors of interest: 1) the physiological regressor, 2) the psychological variable, and 3) their product. The physiological regressor comprised the time-series for the anterior insula. The psychological (task) regressor modeled the contrast of risky choice versus safe choice, convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF). The product regressor modeled the interaction between of the psychological regressor and the physiological regressor, with the psychological regressor zero-centered about the minimum and maximum values and the physiological regressor demeaned. This interaction term identiﬁed regions that covaried in a task-dependent manner with the seed region. The remaining task and motion regressors were included as regressors of no interest. Signiﬁcant, group-level clusters were obtained in a whole-brain analysis by conducting a 2 (Stress)×2 (Age)×2 (Gender) repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) using the FMRIB local analysis of mixed eﬀects (FLAME1) module in FSL with and without sleep duration (mean-centered) entered as a  regressor in the model. Z (Gaussianized T) statistic images were threshold using clusters determined by Z > 2.3 and a whole-brain corrected cluster signiﬁcant threshold of p < .05 using Gaussian Random Field theory. Tests were corrected for family-wise errors (FWE). Anatomical localization within each cluster was obtained by searching within maximum likelihood regions from the FSL HarvardOxford probabilistic atlas.  2.8. Statistical analyses of cortisol data  Since the time of day that participants collected salivary cortisol for baseline varied between participants, a series of linear regressions were used to individually model each participant’s baseline diurnal pattern of cortisol by regressing cortisol values (Cortisol) on the time of day the cortisol sample was collected (Time) and the quadratic form of time of day (Time2) across the two days of collection: Cortisol=b0+b1(Time)+b2(Time2)+e. One limitation in having stress states determined by participants is that the time of day that participants visited the laboratory varied. As a consequence, the time of day the salivary cortisol was collected by participants on the laboratory visits varied. One way to account for this variability in time was to ﬁrst interpolate the predicted cortisol value for the time of day of the visit by substituting the time of day (in hours) into the Time and Time2 variables in each participant’s predicted regression equation. This provided a predicted baseline cortisol value for a particular time of day for a particular participant. This predicted cortisol value was then used to calculate a diﬀerence score from the actual cortisol value collected during each laboratory visit. Three diﬀerence scores in cortisol were calculated for the three laboratory visits for each participant: Lab Cortisol Diﬀerence, High Stress Cortisol Diﬀerence, and Low Stress Cortisol Diﬀerence. These diﬀerence scores were used as measures of cortisol reactivity to stress.  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral results  3.1.1. Stress ratings  A 2 (Stress)×2 (Age)×Sleep (mean-centered) repeated measures ANCOVA, controlling for gender, was conducted on relative change in stress ratings from baseline during high stress and low stress scans. Results revealed a main eﬀect of stress, F(1, 39)=51.145, p < .001 such that the diﬀerence in stress ratings relative to baseline was greater under high stress (M=1.384) compared to that under low stress (M=−.534). There were no signiﬁcant stress×age (p=.905), stress×sleep (p=.839), or stress×sleep×age (p=.387) interactions. Change in stress ratings was not correlated with change in cortisol relative to baseline for high stress or low stress conditions. Controlling for age, gender, and sleep, relative increases in stress ratings under high stress from baseline was positively correlated with overall risk-taking under high stress, averaged across frame and EV trials (partial r=.458, p=.003).  3.1.2. Salivary cortisol  A 2 (Stress)×2 (Age)×Sleep (mean-centered) repeated measures ANCOVA on cortisol diﬀerence, controlling for gender and cortisol diﬀerence during the ﬁrst visit (Lab Cortisol Diﬀerence), revealed a main eﬀect of stress, F(1, 33)=5.527, p=.025. Cortisol diﬀerence from baseline during high stress (M=2.96 nmol/L, SD=8.35 nmol/L) was greater than cortisol diﬀerence from baseline during low stress (M=−.412 nmol/L, SD=7.78 nmol/L). There were no signiﬁcant stress×age (p=.801), stress×sleep (p=.382), or stress×age×sleep (p=.700) interactions.  3.1.3. Sleep duration and risk-taking on the Cups task  The main eﬀects of stress on risky decision-making and how they were moderated by age and gender have been previously reported (Uy  123  J.P. Uy, A. Galván  Neuropsychologia 95 (2017) 119–129  and Galván, 2016). The current report focuses on how sleep duration modiﬁes the relationship between stress and risk-taking over and above the eﬀects of age and gender.  A 2 (Stress)×2 (Frame)×3 (EV)×2 (Age)×Sleep (mean-centered) repeated measures ANCOVA, controlling for gender and scan order, revealed a main eﬀect of EV (F(2, 37)=22.677, p < .001), a stress×EV interaction (F(2, 37)=6.079, p=.005), and a sleep×stress×frame×EV interaction (F(1, 38)=5.283, p=.027). Interactions between sleep and stress did not diﬀer by age; therefore, higher order interaction terms with age were removed and age was instead included as a covariate in subsequent analyses. Post-hoc simple eﬀects were conducted to examine how sleep duration aﬀected the relationship between stress and risky decisions, correcting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni corrections. Analyses revealed a signiﬁcant sleep×stress×frame interaction for EQEV risks (F(1, 39)=7.365, p=.010), but not for ADV risks (p=.794) or DIS risks (p=.195). The sleep×stress interaction was then tested separately for EQEV risks in the gain frame and EQEV risks in the lose frame. Analyses revealed a signiﬁcant sleep×stress interaction for EQEV risks in the gain frame (F(1, 39)=9.724, p=.005), but not in the lose frame (p=.564). Further analyses of the sleep×stress interaction for EQEV risk in the gain frame revealed that under low stress, sleep duration was not associated with EQEV risks in the gain frame (p=.797). However, under high stress, longer sleep duration was associated with fewer EQEV risks taken in the gain frame (t(39) =−2.822, p=.007) (Fig. 2B). In addition, as can be observed in Fig. 2C and F, there was a main eﬀect of sleep duration on DIS risks such that, regardless of frame or stress state, sleep duration was negatively associated with overall DIS risks (F(1, 39)=5.698, p=.022). Collapsing across stress, sleep duration was not signiﬁcantly associated with EQEV risks in the lose frame (p=.212) (Fig. 2E). Sleep duration was also not associated with ADV risks (Fig. 2A and D).  3.1.4. Sleep duration and self-reported risk-taking  A series of hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to examine how sleep duration relates to each subscale on the DOSPERT. Controlling for age and gender and correcting for multiple comparisons, results revealed a negative association between sleep duration and expected beneﬁts of risk such that those who slept fewer hours per  night in the past month reported greater expected beneﬁts from all types of risks, t(40)=−2.833, p=.007. In addition, those who reported greater expected beneﬁts from risks were also more likely to take those risks (t(40)=2.824, p=.007). However, sleep duration was not associated with the likelihood of taking risks or perceived risk subscales on the DOSPERT. Self-reported risk-taking on the DOSPERT was not signiﬁcantly associated with risk-taking on the Cups Task.  3.2. fMRI Results  3.2.1. Main eﬀect of risky choice  ROI analysis of risky choice > safe choice contrast revealed a Stress×Age×Gender interaction in the left anterior insula (MNI coordinates: x=−34, y=22, z=−2, Z=3.42) (Fig. 3A). Parameter estimates for left AI activation in the risky > safe choice contrast under high stress and low stress were extracted to determine the direction of eﬀects. Post-hoc analyses revealed no signiﬁcant group diﬀerences in left AI activation for risky > safe choice under low stress. Under high stress, however, age×gender diﬀerences emerged such that adult males engaged left AI for risky > safe to a greater extent than did adolescent males, F(1, 40)=18.497, p < .001; this eﬀect appears to be driven by a trending decrease in left AI activation for risky > safe from low stress to high stress in adolescent males, F(1, 40)=3.316, p=.076. There were no signiﬁcant eﬀects of stress on left AI activation in adolescent females (p=.478) or adult females (p=.913). There were no signiﬁcant associations between sleep duration and AI activation for risky > safe choice contrast.  To determine whether left AI activation when taking risks under high stress was uniquely associated with risky behavior under high stress over and above sleep duration, a 2 (Frame)×3 (EV)×Insula repeated measures ANCOVA, controlling for age, gender, sleep, and scan order was conducted. Results revealed an EV×Insula interaction, F(2, 37)=4.719, p=.015. Post-hoc simple slope tests on EV trials collapsed across frame indicated that left AI activation under high stress was negatively associated with DIS risks (t(38)=−3.196, p=.003) and EQEV risks (t(38)=−2.567, p=.014) taken under high stress, but not ADV risks under high stress (p=.949). Left AI activation under low stress was not associated with risk-taking under low stress.  Fig. 2.

Uy, A. Galván  Neuropsychologia 95 (2017) 119–129  Fig. 3. (A) ROI analysis of risky choice > safe choice contrast revealed a Stress×Age×Gender interaction in the left anterior insula (MNI coordinates: x=−34, y=22, z=−2, Z=3.42): under high stress, adult males engaged left AI for risky > safe to a greater extent than did adolescent males, F(1, 40)=18.497, p < .001; this eﬀect appears to be driven by a trending decrease in left AI activation for risky > safe from low stress to high stress in adolescent males, F(1, 40)=3.316, p=.076. (B) Sleep×Insula interaction on disadvantageous (DIS) risks taken under high stress: among those sleeping below recommendation limits, left AI activation under high stress was negatively associated with DIS risks under high stress (t(37)=−3.265, p=.002). In contrast, this relationship was attenuated for those who reported sleeping within recommendation limits (p=.184).  3.2.2. The interaction of sleep duration and stress-related anterior insula activation on non-advantageous risk-taking  Given that sleep duration and AI activation appear to uniquely predict non-advantageous risk-taking under high stress, analyses were conducted to determine whether sleep duration and AI activation interact to predict risk-taking under high stress. A 3 (EV)×Insula× Sleep repeated measures ANCOVA, controlling for age, gender, and scan order, revealed an EV×insula×sleep interaction (F(2, 36)=3.918, p=.029). Post-hoc simple eﬀects test indicate that the insula×sleep interaction predicted DIS risks under high stress (t(37)=2.206, p=.034), but not EQEV risks under high stress (p=.816). Sleep duration groups were created to describe the nature of the interaction. Based on age and recommendations from the National Sleep Foundation, individuals were categorized into two groups: one in which sleep duration was within recommendation limits (7.0+ hours per night for adults, n=13; 8.0+ hours per night for adolescents, n=7) and one below recommendation limits (less than 7 h per night for adults, n=9; less than 8 h per night for adolescents, n=15). Controlling for age, gender, and scan order, simple eﬀects tests revealed that for those sleeping below recommendation limits, left AI activation under high stress was negatively associated with DIS risks under high stress (t(37)=−3.265, p=.002). In contrast, this relationship was attenuated for those who reported sleeping within recommendation limits (p=.184) (Fig. 3B). Because of the relatively larger number of adolescents sleeping below recommendation limits, it is possible that, despite statistically controlling for the eﬀects of age, the results of the “below recommended duration” group could be driven by adolescents. As a result, sleep groups were re-categorized based on the median reported duration (7 h). The results held: among those who reported sleeping 5.0–6.9 h per night in the past month (n=9 adults, n=12 adolescents), those who showed less activation of the left AI during risk-taking under high stress took more DIS risks under high stress, t(36)=−2.408, p=.021, while there was still no signiﬁcant relationship between left AI activation and DIS risks taken under high stress for those who slept 7.0+ hours per night in the past month (n=13 adults, n=11 adolescents), t(36)=−.232, p=.818.  3.3. Psychophysiological interaction analyses  3.3.1. Sleep duration and functional coupling between the anterior insula and prefrontal regions  The seed used for PPI analyses was deﬁned as a 6 mm sphere around the peak voxel of the left AI (MNI coordinates: x=−34, y=22, z=−2). On average, during risky > safe choices, left AI was functionally  coupled (positively correlated) with a number of prefrontal regions, including: left DLPFC (x=−28, y=36, z=38, Z=3.63), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), pars triangularis (right: x=50, y=30, z=10, Z=3.53; left: x=−50, y=34, z=4, Z=3.47), bilateral IFG, pars opercularis (right: x=54, y=10, z=12, Z=3.4; left: x=−54, y=14, z=18, Z=3.23), bilateral frontal pole (left: x=−20, y=58, z=18, Z=4.16; right: x=22, y=52, z=34, Z=3.42), vmPFC (x=4, y=38, z=−14, Z=3.28), dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC; x=−10, y=58, z=34, Z=3.58), and ACC (x=4, y=34, z=4, Z=3.97). Left AI was also functionally coupled with bilateral superior temporal gyrus (left: x=−44, y=−40, z=10, Z=3.98, right: x=−56, y=−22, z=6, Z=3.29). These patterns of functional coupling did not diﬀer as a function of stress or age.  When sleep duration was added as a regressor in the GLM, analyses revealed that, on average, sleep duration was negatively associated with functional coupling between the left AI and bilateral caudate (right: x=10, y=6, z=22, Z=4.35; left: x=−12, y=10, z=22, Z=3.04) (Fig. 4A). This relationship did not diﬀer as a function of stress or age. That is, for both adolescents and adults, as sleep duration increases, functional coupling strength between the left AI and bilateral caudate decreases under both high stress (Fig. 4C) and low stress state (Fig. 4D). Functional coupling strength between the AI and caudate was not related to risk-taking behavior.  There was a stress×sleep interaction on functional coupling between the AI and right DLPFC (x=26, y=34, z=38, Z=3.5) (Fig. 4B). Parameter estimates were extracted to probe the direction of eﬀects. Post-hoc simple eﬀects tests, controlling for age, gender, and scan order, revealed that longer reported sleep duration was associated with greater functional coupling between the AI and right DLPFC under high stress (t(39)=2.284, p=.028) (Fig. 4C), but not under low stress (p=.078) (Fig. 4D). Functional coupling between the AI and DLPFC was not related to risky behavior. Finally, as can be seen in Fig. 4C, under high stress, those who reported sleeping longer hours showed greater divergence in functional coupling strength between AI-DLPFC and AI-caudate systems, F(1, 39)=15.653, p < .001, while coupling strength between AI-DLPFC and AI-caudate systems did not diﬀer as a function of sleep duration under low stress (Fig. 4D). The divergence in functional coupling strength between AI-DLPFC and AI-caudate systems was not associated with risk-taking behavior.  4. Discussion  The goal of the current study was to investigate how naturalistic sleep habits aﬀect risky decision-making and related changes in neural  125  J.P. Uy, A. Galván  Neuropsychologia 95 (2017) 119–129  Fig. 4. (A) Sleep duration was negatively associated with functional coupling between the left AI and bilateral caudate (right: x=10, y=6, z=22, Z=4.35; left: x=−12, y=10, z=22, Z=3.04) under both (C) high stress and (D) low stress. (B) There was a stress×sleep interaction on functional coupling between the AI and right DLPFC (x=26, y=34, z=38, Z=3.5): longer reported sleep duration was associated with greater functional coupling between the AI and right DLPFC (C) under high stress (t(39)=2.284, p=.028), but not under (D) low stress (p=.078).  activity when people feel stressed. We found that sleep duration moderated the eﬀects of stress on risky decision-making, but in somewhat unexpected ways. In particular, we predicted that shorter sleep duration would lead to greater increases in non-advantageous risks when people were experiencing high levels of stress relative to lower levels of stress (and no stress-related changes in risk-taking for those who sleep longer). Instead, as can be observed in Fig. 2B, we found that those who reported longer sleep duration took fewer nonadvantageous risks in the gain frame when stressed. That is, longer sleep duration was associated with fewer risky choices for decisions where the expected gain of the risky choice was not greater than that of the safe choice under stress, which could be an adaptive decisionmaking strategy. In contrast, there were no stress-related changes in risky behavior for those reporting fewer hours of sleep. It appears then that longer sleep duration might serve as a protective factor against stress and even allows one to reap the adaptive decision-making beneﬁts of acute stress. These ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies reporting that sleep deprived individuals (relative to well-rested individuals) increased risk-taking for gains (Libedinsky et al., 2011; Menz et al., 2012; Mullette-Gillman et al., 2015; Venkatraman et al., 2007, 2011). Moreover, we also found that shorter sleep duration was associated with greater disadvantageous risks taken, regardless of frame or stress state, consistent with previous studies that showed that showed that poor sleep was related to decreases in the use of expected value information when making decisions (Libedinsky et al., 2011; Menz et al., 2012; Mullette-Gillman et al., 2015). Finally, we found that individuals who reported sleeping fewer hours per night also reported greater expected beneﬁts from taking real world risks,  corroborating the idea that individuals who obtain poor sleep may exhibit a positivity bias when evaluating risks.  We predicted that the interaction between sleep and stress on risky behavior would be stronger in adolescents relative to adults. Although we did not ﬁnd that the interaction was statistically signiﬁcant, the eﬀect could have been masked by the diﬀerences in sleep needs between the age groups (that adolescents might require more sleep than do adults) and the high prevalence of adolescents not obtaining suﬃcient sleep inherent in the population. In other words, it could be that the eﬀects of stress in the current study were being evaluated between sleep-deprived adolescents and well-rested adults, and that any eﬀects of sleep observed could also reﬂect eﬀects of age. Indeed, though the Chi-square test revealed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the distribution, we have slightly more adolescents sleeping less than their recommended 8-h minimum (n=15) than adults are sleeping less than their recommended 7-h minimum (n=9). While this may be of concern for data analysis and interpretation, the distribution of our sample actually reﬂects the real distribution reported by the CDC. In our sample, we have about 41% of adults and 68% of adolescents who reported sleeping insuﬃcient sleep, similar to the CDC’s report of about 35% and over 60%, respectively. Despite being more ecologically valid, one of the drawbacks in investigating naturalistic sleep habits in adolescents is that we may not have an adequate number of adolescents getting enough sleep in our sample to adequately investigate the eﬀects of sleep in this population. These considerations need to be taken into account when interpreting the results of the current study.  fMRI analyses revealed that sleep duration interacted with stressrelated changes in brain activation to predict risk-taking behavior.  126  J.P. Uy, A. Galván  Neuropsychologia 95 (2017) 119–129  Speciﬁcally, under high stress, individuals who showed reduced activation of the left AI during decision-making took more risks that were disadvantageous (in which participants chose a risky option that was unlikely to yield a good outcome over a safe option that would yield a small monetary gain). This relationship was stronger for those who reported sleeping insuﬃcient hours (as determined by age-speciﬁc NSF-recommended duration) and was attenuated for those who reported sleeping suﬃcient hours, controlling for age. The results held even after re-categorizing sleep groups based on the median reported duration of 7 h to take into account the disproportionate amount of adolescents receiving insuﬃcient sleep (i.e., sleeping less than 8 h per night). In other words, even when adolescents weren't sleeping “enough”, those who reported sleeping at least a minimum of 7 h per night on average were able to reap the same beneﬁts as adults who obtain suﬃcient sleep.  Given previous literature that showed developmental diﬀerence in functional connectivity strength between the AI-aﬀective and AIcognitive systems, we conducted PPI analyses to determine whether the relationship between functional coupling of the AI and aﬀective systems and functional coupling of the AI and cognitive systems was associated with risk-taking behavior and also whether functional coupling was aﬀected by sleep duration. We found that, on average, the left AI was functionally coupled with a number of prefrontal regions including the DLPFC, IFG, vmPFC, dmPFC, and ACC, consistent with previous functional connectivity studies that investigated the AI (Fair et al., 2007; Stevens et al., 2009). This pattern of functional coupling did not diﬀer by age, which could be due to our adolescent sample being older than those reported in previous studies (e.g., adolescents were 10–15 years of age in Fair et al., 2007). There was no main eﬀect of stress, but there was a main eﬀect of sleep on functional coupling between the AI and caudate, and a sleep×stress interaction in functional coupling between the AI and DLPFC. Together, under high stress, longer sleep duration was associated with decreasing functional coupling between the AI and caudate and increasing functional coupling between the AI and DLPFC when taking risks. These ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies that found that poor sleep was associated with reduced functional coupling between aﬀective and regulatory regions in adults (Gujar et al., 2011; Yoo et al., 2007), and more speciﬁcally with reduced functional coupling between the DLPFC and AI during reward processing in adolescents (Telzer et al., 2013). This divergence in functional coupling between the AI with aﬀective and cognitive control systems under conditions of stress suggest that those who sleep longer might be better at engaging top-down regulation of aﬀective processes during stress relative to those who sleep less, which has implications for risky behavior. In addition, that sleep duration was not associated with risky behavior or functional activity under low stress suggests that the advantages of suﬃcient sleep may only be evident during aﬀective arousal. We did not ﬁnd that functional coupling between the AI and either of these systems or the extent to which divergence in functional coupling between the AI and these two systems under high stress was associated with risky behavior. However, these fMRI ﬁndings, in conjunction with more optimal behavior in the gain frame under high stress for those who sleep longer suggest that this could be one potential (perhaps indirect) mechanism by which achieving suﬃcient sleep confers advantages in the face of stress.  Decision-making behaviors are sensitive to changes in dopaminergic activity, which are inﬂuenced by both acute stress and sleep loss, providing a possible mechanism that explains how stress and habitual sleep loss aﬀect decision-making. In rats, increases in mRNA expression of D1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens and insular cortex were positively associated with risk-taking to large rewards (Simon et al., 2011), indicating that D1 receptors in the insula may be involved in valuation of risky versus safe outcomes and cost-beneﬁt decisionmaking (Cardinal, 2006; Naqvi and Bechara, 2009). In humans, genetic polymorphisms associated with high levels of D1 receptors in the striatum were predictive of greater reward-driven behavior during  decision-making (Frank et al., 2007; Richard and Berridge, 2011). Acute stress inﬂuences risky decision-making behavior through cortisol-related increases in dopamine release in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (Pruessner et al., 2004; Ungless et al., 2010), which have bidirectional projections with the insula (Mesulam and Mufson, 1982; Mufson and Mesulam, 1982), potentially inﬂuencing D1 receptor activity in the insula through stress-related changes in the dopaminergic system. Animal models demonstrate that glucocorticoid-related increase in dopamine release on the nucleus accumbens and PFC increases D1 receptor binding in the PFC to the point of which impairs cognitive function (Ambroggi et al., 2009; Butts et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 1996; Vijayraghavan et al., 2007) and impacts optimal regulation of subcortical structures (Arnsten and Goldman-Rakic, 1998; Raio et al., 2013). These ﬁndings suggest that stress may act speciﬁcally on D1 receptors.  On the other hand, activation of D2 receptors in the striatum via systemic increases in D2 agonists in rats attenuated preferences for large, risky rewards as the risk of punishment increased, underlying risk-avoidant behaviors (Simon et al., 2011). In humans, genetic polymorphisms associated with high D2 receptors in the striatum were associated with greater avoidance of punishment (Frank et al., 2007; Richard and Berridge, 2011). Sleep deprivation aﬀects the dopaminergic system by possibly up-regulating concentrations of dopamine to maintain wakefulness (Volkow et al., 2008, 2009) while also downregulating D2 receptor availability in the ventral striatum (Volkow et al., 2012), which has implications for risky decision-making behavior. Taken together, stress and sleep deprivation might concomitantly increase D1 receptor binding and decrease D2 receptor binding, respectively, to alter decision-making behavior. These relationships, however, are yet to be experimentally tested. Using fMRI, researchers have suggested that enhanced ventral striatal reactivity to monetary gains and attenuated insula activity to losses during risk-taking following sleep deprivation may reﬂect dopaminergic changes (Venkatraman et al., 2007, 2011). Though plausible, dopamine was not directly measured in those studies or in the current study, precluding a deﬁnitive conclusion. Future research utilizing animal models and PET studies in humans could provide insight into the processes by which sleep loss and acute stress interact to modify risky decision-making behavior.  The results of the current study are novel as they are the ﬁrst to characterize how normative sleep duration aﬀects risky decisionmaking when adolescents and adults experience naturally occurring daily stress. Nevertheless, there are a few limitations to note. First, given that there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in sleep duration between the two groups and that adolescents require more sleep than adults, our sample may have included more adolescents than adults who experienced poor sleep. However, a Chi-square test revealed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the distribution of individuals who reported receiving insuﬃcient sleep between adolescents and adults. Future studies investigating adolescents should be mindful of this limitation during sampling and attempt to also enroll adolescents who are getting enough sleep. Second, our measure of sleep duration was determined by participants’ self-reported sleep duration. Self-reported sleep duration has been shown to be moderately correlated (r=.45) with objective sleep measures obtained using actigraph watches and daily diary in adults (Biddle et al., 2015; Cespedes et al., 2016; Lauderdale, 2008) and in adolescents (Short et al., 2012; Wolfson et al., 2003). If there were any biases, self-reported measures of habitual sleep duration tended to overestimate actual sleep duration (Biddle et al., 2015; Cespedes et al., 2016; Lauderdale, 2008), raising the possibility that our participants could have been actually sleeping fewer hours per night than they reported. If these biases were true in our sample (i.e., if participants were sleeper fewer hours than they reported), then the current study is actually a conservative report of how sleep impacts the association between neural activation and risky decision making. Perhaps using more objective measures of sleep duration would yield  127  J.P. Uy, A. Galván  Neuropsychologia 95 (2017) 119–129  stronger eﬀects of sleep on stress-related neural changes and behavior. Alternatively, it is also possible that participants’ subjective reports of how much sleep they receive could modify their appraisals of stressors and subsequent behaviors to a greater extent than would objective reports of sleep. Third, self-reported sleep duration was only measured when participants enrolled in the study. We did not collect measures of sleep at each visit. It is possible that participants who reported long habitual sleep duration at the beginning of the study could have slept poorly the night before, or vice-versa. On the other hand, we speculate that what participants reported at the beginning of the study is consistent with what they would have reported during the stress visits. To arrive at a more deﬁnitive conclusion, future studies should track daily diary reports of sleep habits in conjunction with objective sleep reports using actigraph watches and daily stress ratings to further explore the relationships between daily sleep and stress. Fourth, the non-experimental nature of our stress induction limits our ability to precisely characterize the role of cortisol in stress-related diﬀerences in neural response. Nonetheless, our results suggest that our ecologically-valid stress assessment is robust and captures stress-related diﬀerences in the neural correlates of risky decision-making behavior. Additionally, the non-experimental nature of our study precludes any claims about causality. However, researchers have found that individuals who experienced just one night without sleep showed greater baseline cortisol and greater cortisol response to acute stress than those who received suﬃcient sleep (Minkel et al., 2014), suggesting a causal link between sleep and HPA axis functioning. The current study did not ﬁnd that naturalistic sleep duration was related to cortisol reactivity to stress, which could be due to our approximate measure of sleep duration, the delayed measure of cortisol relative to stressor onset, or might suggest that more extreme forms of sleep loss may be necessary to detect observable changes in HPA functioning. Finally, it is possible that inexperienced MRI participants might ﬁnd the fMRI experience stressful, which could conﬂate the fMRI data collected on the diﬀerent stress days. Consequently, we controlled for scan order in our analyses to account for this possibility and the results held. Though we did not collect data on participants’ scanner experience in the current study, we prepared participants for the fMRI environment using a simulated scanner and followed recommendations suggested by Galván et al. (2012) to acquire meaningful and informative fMRI data.  In sum, our ﬁndings highlight the neural costs of habitually attaining insuﬃcient sleep by showing that even normative amounts of shorter sleep duration can interact with stress- and risk-related neural regions and lead to suboptimal decision-making in stressful contexts.

Depending on the nature of the source, the same communication signal might be processed in fundamentally different ways. However, the selective modulation (or “gating”) of the ﬂow of neural information during communication is not fully understood. Here, we use multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) and multivoxel connectivity analysis (MVCA), a novel technique that allows to analyse context-dependent changes of the strength interregional coupling between ensembles of voxels, to examine how the human brain differentially gates content-speciﬁc sensory information during ongoing perception of communication signals. In a simulated electronic communication experiment, participants received two alternative text messages during fMRI (“happy” or “sad”) which they believed had been sent either by their real-life friend outside the scanner or by a computer. A region in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) selectively increased its functional coupling with sensory-content encoding regions in the visual cortex when a text message was perceived as being sent by the participant's friend, and decreased its functional coupling with these regions when a text message was perceived as being sent by the computer. Furthermore, the strength of neural encoding of content-speciﬁc information of text messages in the dmPFC was modulated by the social tie between the participant and her friend: the more of her spare time a participant reported to spend with her friend the stronger was the neural encoding. This suggests that the human brain selectively gates sensory information into the relevant network for processing the mental states of others, depending on the source of the communication signal.  © 2014 The Authors.

Introduction  In modern society, humans are not only confronted with various communication signals sent by other humans, but also with a multitude of anonymous signals transmitted by electronic communication devices and the media. Despite their physical similarity, these communication signals might encode very different information, and might require very different processing, depending on the source. Suppose, for example, a person hearing a narrator in the radio and his best friend talking about a car accident that happened that morning. When listening to the radio, the listener is presumably primarily interest in the news. In contrast, when listening to his friend, the listener might try to understand how his friend felt when observing the accident. Thus, just as effective processing of signals from the physical world requires some form of sensory gating (e.g. Knight et al., 1999), effective processing of social signals might require some form of “social gating” that selectively  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Universität zu Lübeck, Department of Neurology,  Ratzeburger Alle 160, 23538 Lübeck, Germany.

Recent advances in application of multivariate pattern-recognition algorithms in neuroimaging (Haynes and Rees, 2006; Kriegeskorte et al., 2006; Norman et al., 2006) have enabled researchers to investigate the processing of communication signals in the human brain at the level of content-speciﬁc neural representations. This research has shown that auditory and visual communication signals are parsed into content-related and source-related features early in the processing stream (Formisano et al., 2008; Ethofer et al., 2009; Fox et al., 2009). However, it is currently unknown how such content-speciﬁc sensory information is relayed to higher processing stages that enable social cognition.  A longer line of research has shown that when people interact with or make inferences about other people neural activity increases in a neural network (often referred to as “mentalizing network”) that includes the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), precuneus and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) (Frith and Frith, 2003; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Mitchell, 2009). This increase of neural activity has often been interpreted as reﬂecting activation of cognitive processes required during social cognition, such as directing attention towards mental  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.007 1053-8119/© 2014 The Authors.

Interestingly, a ﬁrst study using multivoxel pattern analysis to investigate mPFC function provided evidence that the mPFC might not only support speciﬁc social cognitive processes, but might also encode contentspeciﬁc information of communication signals at a supra-modal level (Peelen et al., 2006).  Here, we use a simulated communication experiment to examine how the human brain selectively gates sensory information of communication signals into neural networks that enable social cognition. Participants were made believe that they were receiving two alternative short text messages (“happy” or “sad”) from their real-life friend outside the scanner, or from a computer. In order to separate sender-dependent modulation of the ﬂow of neural information from any modulatory effects that might be due to different response requirements, participants were not required to respond to their friends. To map the selective gating of the ﬂow of neural information in the receiver's brain, we ﬁrst used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA, Haynes and Rees, 2006; Kriegeskorte et al., 2006; Norman et al., 2006) to identify brain regions where the sensory content of text messages was encoded independent of the perceived sender, and then searched for brain regions that changed their functional coupling with these sensory-content encoding regions in a sender-dependent manner. For the latter step we used multivoxel connectivity analysis (MVCA), a novel technique that allows to analyse context-dependent changes of the strength of interregional functional coupling between ensembles of voxels.  Materials and methods  Participants  Twenty female participants with no record of neurological or psychiatric disorders were recruited from the Universität zu Lübeck. Participants were asked to bring one of their female friends as communication partner (“sender”) to the imaging session. All participants gave written consent before participation and the study was approved by the local Ethics committee (Universität zu Lübeck, Lübeck). Data sets of two participants were later excluded because when explicitly asked after the experiment (see below) they reported doubts that the text messages they had received during imaging had actually been sent by their friend. The ﬁnal data set consisted of data from 18 participants (age range 19–28 years, mean 22.1 years, 16 right-handed, 2 left-handed). Participants had ﬁrst met their friend at school (N = 3), university (N = 9), leisure activities (N = 2) or on other occasions (N = 4). At the time of the study, participants had known their friend for an average of 3.4 years (range 6 months to 15 years). To ensure that participants were a representative sample of the population with regard to interpersonal traits all participants were asked to complete a German 16-item version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI, Davis, 1983), the Saarbrücker Persönlichkeitsfragebogen (SPF, http://bildungswissenschaften. uni-saarland.de/personal/paulus/homepage/ﬁles/SPF-IRI-_V6.1. pdf). Participants' scores deviated less than one standard deviation (SD) from the norm of their German age reference group (Normentabellen des SPF, http://bildungswissenschaften.unisaarland.de/personal/paulus/empathy/Normen.pdf, November 21, 2011) on all four subscales (empathic concern, mean = 3.5, SD = 0.6, norm 3.6; fantasy, mean = 3.5, SD = 0.8, norm 3.6; perspective taking, mean = 3.5, SD = 0.6, norm 3.7; personal distress, mean = 2.5, SD = 0.8, norm 2.8).  Cover story  Participants and their friends were told a cover story in order to create an experimental situation in which participants believed they were receiving short text messages sent by either their friend or a computer. Upon arrival in the lab, participants and their friends were informed  that the goal of the study was to investigate the neural mechanisms of short text message communication. They were told that the task of the participant's friend (the “sender”) would be to judge the affective state (happy or sad) of a number of persons, based on photographs of their faces, and to convey each of her decisions by a text message to the participant inside the scanner (the “receiver”). They were then shown the ﬁrst two trials of a fake experimental set-up in which photographs appeared on a computer screen and, after the “sender” had entered her decision on a keyboard, the corresponding German text message (“glücklich” [happy] or “traurig” [sad]) appeared on a second screen. They were further told that, on a random basis, photographs would not be evaluated by the participant's friend but by a computer equipped with software for automatic analysis of facial expressions, which would then return the corresponding message to the participant. Finally, participants were told that in some runs the colour of the letters would indicate who had sent the message (i.e. green letters, friend; blue letters, computer; counterbalanced across participants) while in other runs all messages would be printed in grey letters. The latter runs were part of a different study and data of these runs were not analysed in the current study. The cover story was chosen to ensure that text messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend and text messages perceived as being sent by the computer were highly similar with regard to (i) visual features, (ii) object of reference (an unknown third person), (iii) content (the third person's affective state, happy or sad) and (iv) response requirements (participants were not required to respond to the putative sender). Please note that this cover story was intended to allow the identiﬁcation of visual areas that encode content-speciﬁc sensory information during text-message communication, and not to induce widespread empathic responses in the receiver's brain that are typically observed when participants observe an intimate's affective state (e.g. Anders et al., 2011). To ensure that participants attended to the text messages they were asked to indicate by button press after each message who they believed had sent that message. In fact, text messages were presented in a predeﬁned order and the participant's friend was asked to perform an unrelated behavioural experiment while waiting for the participant. To maintain the illusion of the cover story, an error message instead of a text message appeared in a dummy trial after the ﬁrst third of runs had been completed, and the experimenter suggested to the participant that her friend might have had hit an invalid key on the keyboard and that there would be a short delay because this had to be ﬁxed.  Experimental procedure  Functional image acquisition was divided into sixteen runs. During each run, eight coloured text messages, balanced across the four sender-content combinations (friend-happy, friend-sad, computerhappy, computer-sad) (odd runs, 1-3-5-7-9-11-13-15), or twelve grey text messages, balanced across the two contents (happy and sad) (even runs, 2-4-6-8-10-12-14-16), were presented for 1000 ms each in randomized order. After a delay (2 s or 3.5 s) a response mapping screen appeared for 300 ms (two arrow heads, one pointing to the left and one pointing to the right, one labelled with the friend's ﬁrst name and the other labelled with “PC”), indicating the participant to convey her response by a response button in her left or right hand, respectively (Fig. 1). Two alternative response mapping screens were used, one with the left and the other with the right arrow head labelled with the participant's ﬁrst name. Response mapping screens were balanced across the four sender-content combinations and presented in randomized order for each sender-content combination. This way, the participant's decision and subsequent motor response were decoupled. Each trial terminated with a variable inter-trial interval (8.7 to 13.2 s, varying in steps of 1.5 s). Text messages and response mapping screens were presented through MRI-compatible video goggles (VisuaStim, Resonance Technology, Northridge CA, USA) and stimulus presentation and response logging was controlled with Cogent (Wellcome Laboratory of  S.

After a delay of 2 s or 3.5 s, one of two alternative response mapping screens appeared for 0.3 s, indicating the participant to convey her response by a response button in her left or right hand, respectively. This way, the participant's decision and subsequent motor response were decoupled. Each trial terminated with a variable inter-trial interval from 8.7 to 13.2 s (varying in steps of 1.5 s).

Only data from odd runs (i.e. colour-coded runs) were used in the current study. After imaging, participants completed a German version of the Measure of Adolescents' Friendship Closeness questionnaire (Table 1, Beadnell et al., 2007) and an in-house questionnaire inquiring about their belief in the cover story. Finally, participants were debriefed.  for each run with a stick function, convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function as implemented in SPM5. Two additional regressors of no interest per run were used to model left and right button presses. This way, we obtained seven individual activity maps for each sender-content combination (friend-happy, friend-sad, computerhappy, computer-sad) and participant.  MRI data acquisition  MRI data were acquired on a 3 Tesla scanner (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems). A T1 weighted anatomical image (MPRAGE, 160 sagital slices, resolution 1x1x1 mm3, FOV 240×240 mm2, ﬂip angle 8°, TI 1010.73 ms) used for spatial normalization of individual data sets was obtained from each participant before functional imaging. Forty-seven T2*weighted echoplanar images (EPI) covering the whole brain were acquired during each run (42 axial slices per volume, tilt angle −30°, slice thickness 3 mm, no gap, interleaved order, in plane resolution 3x3 mm2, FOV 240×240 mm2, ﬂip angle 90°, TE 35 ms, TR 3000 ms, no parallel imaging). Each functional run was preceded by two functional images not included in the analysis to allow for T1 saturation. Data of one functional run of each participant had to be discarded due to technical problems, leaving seven runs per participant for analysis.  Analysis of fMRI data  Image preprocessing and parameter estimation  Image preprocessing and BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) activity estimation were conducted with SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, London, UK). Functional images were temporally and spatially preprocessed using standard procedures (slice acquisition time correction, concurrent spatial realignment and correction of image distortions, normalization into standard MNI space [Collins et al., 1994] based on the T1-weighted image of each participant and a T1-weighted template, and resampling at a spatial resolution of 3×3×3 mm3). Then, individual maps of parameter estimates were obtained for each participant and sender-content combination based on a standard GLM that accounted for ﬁrst-order autocorrelations and low-frequency drifts (high pass cut off period 128 s). The expected time course of BOLD activity during processing of text messages of each sender-content combination was modelled separately  Table 1 Friendship questionnaire (Beadnell et al., 2007) and German translation.  Univariate analysis  In the initial step of our analysis, we used standard univariate analysis to identify brain regions where voxel-wise levels of activity differed during the processing of text messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend and text messages perceived as being sent by the computer. This was done, ﬁrst, to conﬁrm that our task activated the “mentalizing network” and, second, to identify potential target regions for the MVCA (see below). Three linear within-subject contrasts were computed: (i) text messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend minus text messages perceived as being sent by the computer (main effect of sender), (ii) “happy” messages minus “sad” messages (main effect of content) and (iii) “happy” messages perceived as being sent by participant's friend minus “sad” messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend minus “happy” messages perceived as being sent by the computer minus “sad” messages perceived as being sent by the computer (sender-by-content interaction). For random effects group analysis, individual contrast maps were spatially smoothed (8 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel) and entered into a one-sample T-test.  Searchlight-based multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA)  In the second step of our analysis, we used searchlight-based multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) (Haynes and Rees, 2006; Kriegeskorte et al., 2006) to search for brain regions where the sensory content of text messages (“happy” and “sad”) was encoded in local patterns of neural activity, independent of the perceived source.  In this approach, a spherical local neighbourhood (the “searchlight”) is created around each voxel of the brain. A classiﬁer is then trained to distinguish between the spatial patterns of neural activity within this sphere elicited by stimuli of two different classes (e.g. “happy” and “sad” messages). Finally, the same classiﬁer is tested on a new set of patterns of neural activity elicited by stimuli of the same two classes, but during different runs, and the test accuracy is written to centre voxel of the sphere. This way, the complete brain volume is tested,  Question  German translation  Item 1 Item2 Item 3 Item 4 Item 5 Item 6  Are you and this person friends?

Anders et al. / NeuroImage 104 (2015) 189–198  and an individual accuracy map is obtained for each participant for a given classiﬁcation problem.  In the current study, the searchlight radius was set to 9 mm (corresponding to 123 voxels) and a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel and a hard margin as implemented in LIBSVM (http:// www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/∼cjlin/libsvm) was used for classiﬁcation. To ensure that classiﬁcation was based on multivoxel patterns of neural activity and not on the average level of activity within a sphere, the spatial mean of each pattern was set to zero.  Because the aim of this step of our analysis was to identify brain regions that encode content-speciﬁc sensory information independent of the perceived source, we used a cross-sender classiﬁcation scheme that allowed us to identify brain regions where content-speciﬁc sensory information is encoded in patterns of neural activity that are invariant across senders. Speciﬁcally, we trained a classiﬁer either on all patterns of neural activity elicited by text messages ascribed to the participant's friend (7 training samples/class) and then tested the classiﬁer on all patterns of neural activity elicited by text messages ascribed to the computer (7 test samples/class), or vice versa (i.e. two cross-validation runs). For random effects group analysis, accuracy maps obtained with the searchlight-based MVPA were spatially smoothed (6 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel) and entered into a one-sample t-test  Please note that the cross-sender classiﬁcation scheme described above is a very strict test of the hypothesis that sensory information is encoded in spatial patterns of neural activity that are invariant across senders. However, even if in a given brain region sensory content is encoded in patterns of neural activity that are highly similar across senders, encoding can still be more accurate for text messages ascribed to one sender than for text messages ascribed to another sender. To test for this possibility, a ROI (region of interest) - based MVPA was performed in all brain regions identiﬁed with the whole-brain searchlight-based MVPA (i.e. on all voxels within a sphere with a radius of 9 mm [i.e. 123 voxels] centred at the peak voxel of any signiﬁcant cluster identiﬁed with the searchlight-based MVPA). For this analysis, we used a within-sender classiﬁcation scheme that allowed us to compare classiﬁcation accuracies for text messages ascribed to the participant's friend and for text messages ascribed to the computer. The classiﬁer was ﬁrst trained and tested only on patterns of neural activity elicited by text messages ascribed to the participant's friend, and then trained and tested only on patterns of neural activity elicited by text messages ascribed to the computer (7 leave-one out cross validation runs, 6 training samples/class and 1 test sample/class in each cross-validation run). Classiﬁcation accuracies obtained for text messages ascribed to the participant's friend were then subtracted with classiﬁcation accuracies obtained for text messages ascribed to the computer.  Searchlight-based multivoxel connectivity analysis (MVCA)  In the ﬁnal and most important step of our analysis we aimed to identify brain regions that changed the strength of their functional coupling with ensembles of sensory-content encoding voxels, depending on the perceived sender. For this, we used a novel analysis of interregional coupling that combines the searchlight-based approach described above with the logic of a psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI, Friston et al., 1997), it searches for contextdependent changes in functional connectivity between ensembles of voxels. We refer to this analysis as searchlight-based multivoxel connectivity analysis (MVCA).  i.e.  In this approach, a seed region is determined whose functional connectivity with other regions in the brain is to be examined. Next, in analogy to the searchlight-based MVPA described above, a spherical local neighbourhood (the “searchlight”) is created around each voxel of the brain. Finally, an nvoxel seed × nvoxel target matrix is computed for each searchlight that contains, in a given cellij, the difference of the strength of connectivity between two voxels vseed i and vtarget j between two conditions A and B (Fig. 2). The average of this matrix represents the change in the strength of multivoxel functional connectivity between the seed  region and the target region between the two conditions, Δ strength of multivoxel connectivity, and is written to the centre voxel of the searchlight. This way, the complete brain volume is tested, and an individual multivoxel connectivity map is obtained for each participant.  Please note that while this approach allows to quantify changes of the strength of functional coupling between ensembles of voxels, it is insensitive to the sign of single voxel-wise functional connectivities. In this regard, the MVCA resembles other multivoxel approaches: multivoxel approaches, in contrast to most univariate approaches, do not ask whether the level of overall neural activity is higher in one condition or the other (or, in the case of MVCA, whether functional coupling between two brain regions is positive or negative), but whether a brain region carries stimulus-speciﬁc information (or, in the case of MVCA, whether the strength of coupling between ensembles of voxels changes from one condition to another).  As for the searchlight-based MVPA, the searchlight radius for the MVCA was set to 9 mm (corresponding to 123 voxels). To separate multivoxel connectivities from any correlated ﬂuctuations of the average level of activity in the seed and the target region, the spatial mean of all voxels within a searchlight was set to zero. Voxel-by-voxel correlations were computed as Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient over the 7 “happy” and the 7 “sad” activity maps for each sender (i.e. n = 14 data points for each correlation). All correlation coefﬁcients were Fisher-transformed (log[[1 + r]/[1−r]]/2) before subtraction. Note that although voxel-wise differences were computed between the absolute values of Fisher-transformed correlation coefﬁcients (i.e. between two approximately half-normal distributions) the resulting Δ strength of multivoxel connectivity can be assumed to be approximately normally distributed, because each Δ strength of multivoxel connectivity represents the mean of N100 × 100 voxel-wise differences per matrix (Fig. 2). For random effects group analysis, connectivity maps were spatially smoothed (6 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel) and entered into a onesample T-test. Overlaps between signiﬁcant changes in the strength of functional connectivity (detected with the searchlight-based MVCA) and the “mentalizing network” (identiﬁed with the univariate analysis) were computed as percentage of voxels of any cluster identiﬁed with the searchlight-based MVCA that were also signiﬁcantly activated in the univariate analysis.  To further characterize changes of the strength of functional coupling between brain regions detected with the searchlight-based MVCA we performed three additional analyses.  First, to test whether the searchlight-based MVCA indeed detected changes in functional coupling between ensembles of voxels that would have remained undetected with a conventional univariate approach, we performed a univariate functional connectivity analysis, using the same seed region as in the searchlight-based MVCA. For this analysis, parameter estimates for each “sad” and each “happy” message were averaged across all voxels in the seed region and across all voxels in the searchlight. As above, Pearson's correlation coefﬁcients were computed over the 7 “happy” and the 7 “sad” activity maps for each sender (i.e. n = 14 data points for each correlation). In this analysis, the difference of the Fishertransformed correlation coefﬁcient for condition A (i.e. text messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend) and B (i.e. text messages perceived as being sent by the computer) simply represents the change of the strength of univariate connectivity between the seed region and the target region between the two conditions.  Second, to conﬁrm that neural activity in any region detected with the searchlight-based MVCA was indeed more accurately explained by neural activity in the seed region than by the text message itself, we performed a second MVCA with two artiﬁcial seed data sets (one for condition friend, the other for condition computer) in which the voxel-wise level of activity in all trials with “happy” messages was dummy-coded with {1}, and the voxel-wise level of activity in all trials with “sad” messages was dummy-coded with {−1}. In other words, we generated seed data that precisely reﬂected the stimulus type and were not ﬁltered by any neural activity. A ﬁnding that a given target  S.

The idea of MVCA is to assess context-dependent changes of the strength of functional coupling between ensembles of voxels in a seed region and a target region. For this, an nvoxel seed × nvoxel target matrix is computed that contains, in a given cellij, the difference of the strength of connectivity between two voxels vseed i and vtarget j between two conditions A (e.g. text messages ascribed to participant's friend, green) and B (e.g. text messages ascribed to the computer, blue). Voxel-by-voxel connectivities are computed across all trials of a given condition (e.g. all “happy” and “sad” text messages ascribed to participant's friend and all “happy” and “sad” text messages ascribed to the computer). The average of this matrix represents the change in the strength of multivoxel functional connectivity between the seed region and the target region between the two conditions, Δstrength of multivoxel connectivity.  region would show a signiﬁcant Δ strength of multivoxel connectivity for the real data but not for the dummy-coded data would indicate that neural activity in the target region is more accurately explained by neural activity in the seed region than by the type of the text message (“happy” or “sad”) alone.  Third, a signiﬁcant increase of the strength of functional coupling between ensembles of voxels does not necessarily mean that more content-speciﬁc information is conveyed from the seed region to the target region in one condition than in the other. To test this, we performed a ROI-based MVPA using a within-sender classiﬁcation scheme as described above in all brain regions identiﬁed with the whole-brain searchlight-based MVCA (i.e. on all voxels within a sphere with a radius of 9 mm [i.e. 123 voxels] centred at the peak voxel of any signiﬁcant cluster identiﬁed with the searchlight-based MVCA).  Correlation between real-life social ties and neural encoding  Finally, we asked whether any sender-dependent encoding of content-speciﬁc information of text messages would not only depend on whether the perceived sender was a human or a computer, but was further modulated by the receiver's social closeness to the sender. To test this, we used the within-sender classiﬁcation accuracies obtained with the ROI-based MVCA described above, subtracted them (friend minus computer), and correlated the difference with the participants' self-reported intensity of friendship with their friend.  Statistical inference and anatomical labelling  All group statistical parametric maps (univariate, searchlight-based MVPA, searchlight-based MVCA) were thresholded at a voxel-wise threshold of T = 3.4 (corresponding to a probability of false positives of p = .002 for single voxels) and group statistical inference was based on the spatial extent of clusters of suprathreshold voxels, using a probability of false positives of pcluster = .05, corrected for multiple comparisons according to non-stationary Random Field Theory (Hayasaka et al., 2004). Signiﬁcant clusters were labelled with the AAL atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002).  For all ROI analyses, a probability of false positives of p = .05 was adopted, and one-tailed statistics were used if we had an a-priori onesided hypothesis (i.e. stronger within-sender classiﬁcation accuracies for text messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend than for text messages perceived as being sent by the computer in any cluster detected with the searchlight-based MVCA, and a positive correlation between this difference and intensity of friendship).  Results  Behavioural data  When explicitly asked after the imaging procedure, all but two participants (who were excluded from further analysis, see Methods) reported that they had believed that they had received text messages from  194  S.

These participants identiﬁed the alleged sender correctly in 98.9 +/− 0.3 % (mean +/− SEM) of all trials, indicating reliable performance, and responded equally fast to all messages (friendhappy, 529 +/− 21 ms; friend-sad, 540 +/− 29 ms, computer-happy, 547 +/− 23 ms, computer-sad, 538 +/− 23 ms; main effect of sender, F(1,17) = 1.7, p = .21; main effect of content, F(1,17) = 0.8; p = .38; sender-by-content interaction F(1,17) = 2.9, p = .11), indicating similar performance across conditions. Given the very small number of incorrect responses, trials with incorrect responses were treated as trials with correct responses in the analysis of the fMRI data.  Univariate analysis  In the initial step of our analysis we contrasted neural activity during processing of text messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend with neural activity during processing of text messages perceived as being sent by the computer in a standard univariate approach. As expected, we found a signiﬁcant increase of activity during processing of text messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend in a distributed set of brain regions, including the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the precuneus, the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the left and right temporal pole (TP) (Fig. 3A and Table 2). This pattern of activity is consistent with activity in the “mentalizing  network” reported in previous studies (Frith and Frith, 2003; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Mitchell, 2009) and supports the assumption that participants were not just responding to the colour of the text message, but made a decision on who had sent a text message. As expected, standard univariate analysis did not reveal any overall or senderdependent differences in neural activity between “happy” and “sad” messages.  Searchlight-based multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA)  In the second step of our analysis, we searched for brain regions that encoded the sensory content of text messages independent of the social context. Searchlight-based cross-sender MVPA detected a cluster in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOT), where the classiﬁer could accurately discriminate between “happy” and “sad” messages (accuracy = .62 + / - .02 [mean +/- SEM]), and a second cluster in the right VOT were the performance of the classiﬁer was just below statistical signiﬁcance (accuracy = .61 + / - .02, Fig. 3B and Table 2). In other words, in these regions content-speciﬁc sensory information of text messages was encoded in spatial patterns of neural activity that were invariant across senders.  ROI-based within-sender MVPA within the left and right cluster showed that “happy” and “sad” messages ascribed to the participant's  Table 2 Signiﬁcantly activated clusters in the whole brain analyses.

This provides additional evidence that neural encoding of text messages in the VOT is not modulated by the perceived sender.  Searchlight-based multi-voxel connectivity analysis (MVCA)  In the third and most important step of our analysis we asked how content-speciﬁc sensory information of text messages is relayed to higher stages of processing. Particularly, we were interested to see whether any region of the “mentalizing network” would change the strength of its functional coupling with the sensory-content encoding clusters in the VOT, depending on the perceived sender of the message. For this, we used searchlight-based MVCA with a combined seed region, i.e. all voxels within two spherical seed regions with a radius of 9 mm, one centred at the peak voxels in the left VOT and the other centred at the peak voxel of the right VOT (246 voxels in total). This analysis detected a cluster in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) that showed signiﬁcantly stronger functional coupling with the sensorycontent encoding clusters in the VOT when the text message was perceived as being sent by the participant's friend than when it was perceived as being sent by the computer (Fig. 3C and Table 2). Notably, this cluster partly overlapped (34 percent) with the cluster in the dmPFC that showed an increased level of overall activity in response to text messages sent by the participant's friend in the standard univariate analysis (see Fig. 3A and C).  To test for possible laterality effects in functional connectivity between the dmPFC and the left and right VOT, we performed two separate searchlight-based MVCAs, one using only data from the spherical seed region in the left VOT, the other only using data from the spherical seed region in the right VOT (i.e. 123 voxels in each seed region). These analyses detected a large cluster in the dmPFC that showed signiﬁcantly stronger functional coupling with the sensory-content encoding cluster in the left VOT ([−9 48 36], T(17) = 5.2, k = 122 voxels, pcluster = .040, corrected) and a second cluster in the superior frontal gyrus that showed the same behaviour ([−21 15 60], T(17) = 6.0, k = 70 voxels, pcluster = .045, corrected). Searchlightbased MVCA with the right VOT seed region alone revealed no signiﬁcant cluster. At a lower height threshold (T = 2.9, p = .005, uncorrected) we detected a cluster in the dmPFC in the vicinity of the cluster detected with the searchlight-based MVCA with the left VOT seed region that did not survive correction for multiple comparisons ([−6 48 30], T(17) = 3.3, k = 10 voxels). A direct comparison of the searchlightbased MVCA with the left and right VOT did not reveal any signiﬁcant differences; therefore, laterality effects will not be discussed further.  In contrast to the searchlight-based MVCA with real data, the dummy-coded MVCA did not detect any signiﬁcant clusters. This indicates that neural activity in the dmPFC was indeed more accurately explained by neural activity in content-encoding clusters in the VOT than by the text message itself.  Furthermore, ROI-based within-sender MVPA within the signiﬁcant cluster in the dmPFC conﬁrmed that relevant information was transmitted from the sensory-content encoding visual region to the dmPFC, again depending on the perceived sender: Within-sender classiﬁcation accuracies were signiﬁcantly higher for text messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend than for those perceived as being sent by the computer (T(17) = 2.0, p = .031, one-tailed), while crosssender classiﬁcation accuracies were at chance level (T(17) = −0.4, p N 0.50, one-tailed).  Finally, as expected, univariate functional connectivity analysis, averaging the level of neural activity across all voxels in the seed region and across all voxels in the searchlight, did not detect any signiﬁcant sender-dependent differences in functional coupling between the sensory-content encoding regions in the VOT and any other brain region.  Correlation between real-life social ties and neural encoding  In our ﬁnal analysis, we asked whether encoding of content-speciﬁc information of text messages in the dmPFC might not only depend on whether the perceived sender is a human or a computer, but is further modulated by the receiver's social closeness to the sender. In other words, we asked whether participants who reported a higher intensity of friendship with their friend would show a more accurate neural encoding of text messages ascribed to their friend. This was indeed the case. An initial analysis indicated that self-reported intensity of friendship (average of items 2–6 in Table 1) explained 17 percent of the variance of individual differences in within-sender classiﬁcation accuracies in the dmPFC (r = .41, T(16) = 1.8, p = .045, one-tailed). However, this correlation disappeared after one participant, whose difference in within-sender classiﬁcation accuracy was more than two SDs lower than the group average, was excluded. Correlation analysis using single items of the friendship questionnaire as predictors indicated that individual differences in within-sender classiﬁcation accuracies were best predicted (34 percent explained variance) by the amount of time participants reported to spend with their friend outside university / work (r = .56, T(16) = 2.7, p = .008, one-tailed). This correlation remained signiﬁcant after the outlier was removed (r = .52, T(15) = 2.4, p = .015, one-tailed, Fig. 4).  Interestingly, the positive relation between intensity of friendship and selective encoding of text messages perceived as being sent by the participant's friend did not seem to be mediated by the overall level of activity in the dmPFC: although there was a considerable overlap between the cluster in the dmPFC that showed a signiﬁcant senderdependent change of overall neural activity and the cluster that showed a signiﬁcant sender-dependent change of functional coupling with the sensory-content encoding region (see Fig. 3A and C and above), the level of neural activity in the dmPFC ([−9 45 30]) did not predict individual differences in within-sender classiﬁcation accuracies in the dmPFC, neither when all participants were included in the analysis (r = −.20, T(16) = −0.8, p N .500, one-tailed) nor when the outlier was removed (r = −.24, T(15) = −1.0, p N .500, one-tailed).

Anders et al. / NeuroImage 104 (2015) 189–198  In the current study we aimed to investigate the selective gating of the ﬂow of neural information during ongoing communication between human communication partners. Speciﬁcally, we asked whether content-speciﬁc information of short text messages is selectively relayed from sensory cortex to higher stages of processing, depending on the perceived sender of the message.  Neural encoding of short text messages in the visual occipital cortex  To keep the current experiment simple, and to permit classiﬁcation analysis with a reasonable number of trials, we limited the set of text messages in the current study to two alternative single-word messages (“happy” and “sad”) whose low-level visual features and semantic content were closely tied. Furthermore, the colour of the text messages indicated who had sent a text messages, such that colour and source were tied within participants. Although this approach did not allow us to map the entire processing stream of text messages (which presumably comprises many distributed neural nodes and pathways, see e.g. Jobard et al., 2003), our analysis revealed two clusters in the posterior ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOT) where content-speciﬁc sensory information of short text messages was encoded in a senderindependent manner. This is in line with previous studies that have shown that the VOT contains multiple word-processing areas that are organized in a hierarchic way, whereby full words are processed most anterior and low-level word-related visual features are processed most posterior (e.g. Vinckier et al., 2007).  Although the precise functional organization of the VOT is still unclear, the sensory content-encoding clusters found in the current study most likely belong to visual area VO-1 (Brewer et al., 2005; Wandell et al., 2007), which is located just posterior-medial to the visual word form area (VWFA) (e.g. Dehaene and Cohen, 2011; Yeatman et al., 2013). This region has been shown to be sensitive to complex shape patterns (e.g. Altmann et al., 2003), and, more recently, to visual-spatial features of letters (Rothlein and Rapp, 2014), which might constitute a processing stage prior to word abstraction.  Our ﬁnding of sender-independent encoding of short text messages in this region is particularly interesting as a recent study in the somatosensory domain suggests that neural responses to tactile communication signals such as a caring touch can be modulated by the perceived source at very early stages of sensory processing (Gazzola et al., 2012). These seemingly discrepant ﬁndings might point to differences in the functional organisation of the processing stream of physical communication signals (like a touch) and more abstract verbal communication signals.  Relay of sensory information to the “mentalizing network”  The most important ﬁnding of the current study is the observation that a region in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) changed the strength of its multivoxel functional coupling with the two sensory-content encoding clusters in the visual cortex, depending on whether a text message was perceived as being sent by the participant's friend or by the computer. Importantly, neural activity in this region was more accurately predicted by neural activity in the sensorycontent encoding clusters in the VOT than by the text message itself. These ﬁndings add to previous evidence that language-related brain areas are functionally connected to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (Spotorno et al., 2012), and that the VOT is structurally connected to the mPFC via ﬁbre bundles of the inferior fronto-occipito fasciculus (Yeatman et al., 2013).  Furthermore, these ﬁndings support and extend current accounts of mPFC function. The mPFC has been shown to be activated not only when individuals believe they are interacting online with a human partner (Gallagher et al., 2002; Rilling et al., 2004; Fukui et al., 2006; Gilbert  et al., 2007; Krach et al., 2009), but also when they make off-line inferences about another person's mental state (Fletcher et al., 1995; Brunet et al., 2000; Gallagher et al., 2000; Ochsner et al., 2004; Ruby and Decety, 2004; Perner et al., 2006; Saxe and Powell, 2006; Gobbini et al., 2007; Mitchell, 2008; Aichhorn et al., 2009; Atique et al., 2011). This has led to the suggestion that the mPFC might serve some speciﬁc cognitive functions that are critical for making inferences about another person's mental state, such as directing attention towards one's own or another person's mental state (Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Kampe et al., 2003) or projecting oneself into a world that differs from one's one current physical or mental state (Mitchell, 2009). A study by Peelen et al. (2006) provided ﬁrst evidence to challenge this process-centred view. Using multivoxel spatial correlation analysis, that study showed that the mPFC carries content-speciﬁc information about another person's mental state at a supra-modal level. The authors proposed that the overall level of neural activity in the mPFC might covary with particular cognitive processes or computations, while the speciﬁc content of these computations might be represented at a ﬁner-grained level of cortical organization in these regions. The ﬁndings of the current study supplement this model by providing evidence that content-speciﬁc sensory information of communication signals is differently gated to the dmPFC, depending on the perceived source of the communication signal.  Importantly, neural encoding of content-speciﬁc information in the dmPFC does not only seem to be a function of whether the perceived sender is a human or a computer, but seems to be further modulated by the receiver's social closeness to the sender. The more time a participant reported to spend with her friend outside university / work, the stronger was the selective increase of encoding accuracy of communication signals believed to be sent by the participant's friend. Two partly independent interindividual factors might contribute to this modulation of encoding accuracy. First, the level of neural activity in the dmPFC has been shown to increase not only when people think about or interact with other humans, but to be further modulated by perceived social proximity (Mitchell et al., 2006; Rilling et al., 2008; Leiberg et al., 2012). Thus, one might hypothesise that the more accurate neural encoding of text messages believed to be sent by a close friend might be driven by a stronger increase of the overall level activity in the dmPFC when participants believed they were communicating with a friend they saw very often. However, post-hoc analysis of our data did not lend support to this hypothesis: The level of dmPFC activity did not predict individual differences in within-sender classiﬁcation accuracy. Second, reenactment of stored sender-related information during the processing of communication signals could enrich the sparse content of short text messages and thereby lead to a more distinct neural representation of the communication signal itself. This would be in line with our ﬁnding that differences in within-sender classiﬁcation accuracies in the dmPFC were better explained by the amount of spare time friends spent together than by any other item of the friendship questionnaire, which might be indicative of the amount of sender-related information the perceiver could re-enact when receiving a text message.  Potential limitations  Addressing potential limitations of the current study it is, ﬁrst of all, important to note that the ﬁndings of the current study cannot easily be explained by increased visual attention to text messages ascribed to the participant's friend. First, participants did not respond faster to text messages ascribed to their friend as one would expect had they processed these signals more attentively. Second, neither the overall level of activity nor the neural encoding of sensory information in the visual cortex was modulated by social context, which would be at odds with the common ﬁnding that visual attention modulates neural activity in visual cortex (e.g. Datta and DeYoe, 2009). Third, selective visual attention has repeatedly been reported to be associated with an increase of activity in a distinct set of lateral prefrontal and parietal brain regions (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002), which were not activated in the current  S. Anders et al. / NeuroImage 104 (2015) 189–198  197  study. Instead, we found robust activity in the “mentalizing network”, a set of brain regions that has consistently be associated with neural processes underlying social cognition. These ﬁndings speak against the assumption that the selective gating of content-speciﬁc sensory information observed in the current study can be explained by visual attention.  A second point important to address is the fact that communication in the current study was limited to a binary electronically transmitted signal (“happy” or “sad”) and strictly unidirectional from the sender to the perceiver. While this experimental approach certainly did not permit to examine all neural processes that occur during natural communication, it allowed us to quite unequivocally link the observed modulation of neural information ﬂow to the perceived source of the messages. Sender-dependent modulation of neural information ﬂow was observed despite the fact that the semantic content of the text messages was very sparse and uniform across senders and despite the fact that information ﬂow was unidirectional and did not require (or even permit) the participant to respond. Thus, the observed modulation of neural information ﬂow cannot easily be explained by different message contents or response requirements. This suggests that the sender-dependent selective modulation of neural information ﬂow (“social gating”) observed in the current study is an effect that occurs during processing of communication signals from different sources even if there is no need to respond.  Finally, it should be mentioned that the current study investigated only female – female communication. This was done because investigating all possible 2 × 2 sex-by-sex interaction pairs would have increased the sample size by factor four. Although we have no strong reason to believe that the effects observed in the current study are limited to communication between females, future studies should aim to include larger samples, including all same-sex and opposite-sex female and male dyads.  Conclusions  In sum, the current study shows that even in a very simple experimental communication setting as used in the current study the human brain shows a remarkable sensitivity to social context: “social gating” mechanisms, possibly akin to the sensory gating mechanisms that ﬁlter sensory signals from the physical world, channel information from socially relevant sources to higher stages of processing that enable social cognition.  Emerging new analysis techniques that assess functional connectivities across ensembles of voxels like the searchlight-based MVCA used here will permit to investigate the ﬂow of neural information during ongoing communication in the human brain more detail. Intriguing questions for future studies are how the “social gating” of neural information is modulated by the degree of mutual interaction between communication partners, and how the human brain recombines message-related and sender-related information when receiving communication signals from multiple human partners.

However, in everyday life many decisions are not followed by feedback, in which case humans have been shown to code the most probable outcome into memory. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural basis of internally generated signals on correctness and decision conﬁdence in the complete absence of feedback in a categorization task. During test trials after observational training activation in dopaminergic target regions was modulated by the correctness of the answer similarly as during feedback-based training. Moreover, activation in the nucleus accumbens and putamen was correlated with the prediction error on conﬁdence as estimated by a reinforcement learning model. In this model subjective conﬁdence ratings acquired after each trial served as outcome measure. Activation in the striatum therefore follows a similar pattern in response to prediction errors on conﬁdence as it does during reinforcement learning in response to reward prediction errors, but with respect to internally generated signals based on knowledge of the structure of the environment. Furthermore, ventral striatal activation decreased with stimulus novelty, which might support the allocation of attention to unfamiliar stimuli. These results provide a parsimonious account for the neural bases of learning, indicating overlapping neural substrates of reinforcement learning and learning when outcome information has to be internally constructed.  © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  Choices are often guided by past experience about which behavior in a given situation provided the most favorable outcome. In the last decade, impressive advances in examining the neural bases of reinforcement learning have been made. Computational theories suggest that during reinforcement learning associative links between stimuli and outcomes are formed and adjusted after each trial to minimize future errors in prediction of the outcome (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Sutton, 1988). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), variables from these models have been shown to be reﬂected in the activation of dopaminergic midbrain neurons and their projection sites also in the human brain. Especially the striatum is activated by a wide range of reinforcing stimuli including juice, odors, money and beauty (see e.g. Abler et al., 2006; Aharon et al., 2001; Gottfried et al., 2002; McClure et al., 2003), but it also responds to information about the correctness of an answer (Aron et al., 2004; Daniel and Pollmann, 2010; Rodriguez et al., 2006). Dopaminergic neurons which project, among other regions, to the striatum, however do not to respond to reward per se. Their activation pattern does not  ⁎ Corresponding author.

Rather, they show phasically increased activation when an unexpected reward occurs (a positive prediction error), and a phasic decrease in activation when an expected reward is omitted (a negative prediction error) (Schultz, 2007). This prediction error signal, the discrepancy between prediction and observed outcome, is assumed to drive learning, which is the building of associations between antecedent events and rewarding stimuli. fMRI activity in the ventral striatum has been shown to follow the reward prediction error in humans (Abler et al., 2006; Berns et al., 2001; Daw et al., 2006; Hare et al., 2008; McClure et al., 2003; O'Doherty et al., 2003, 2004; Pagnoni et al., 2002).  Models of reinforcement  learning are extremely useful  for explaining the gradual learning of stimulus–response habits, yet learning can occur in various ways. One of the most studied forms of human learning is category learning, which is learning to interpret a wide range of stimuli in terms of a limited number of responses (Ashby et al., 1998; Seger et al., 2000). Research on the neural bases of category learning has mainly focused on paradigms that require the viewing of a stimulus and a categorization response from the observer, after which corrective feedback is provided (Ashby and Maddox, 2005). For this paradigm, which is very similar to instrumental reinforcement learning, the central role of the striatum is well supported. Yet, although feedback-based learning is the most effective training for complex category structures, these can also be  3458  R. Daniel, S. Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  learned by observational learning where observers are merely exposed to a stimulus and are told about its associated category label (Ashby et al., 2002; Cincotta and Seger, 2007; Shohamy et al., 2004). Because in ecologically valid situations feedback might not be immediately available after each decision (Hogarth, 2006), the question that arises is which mechanisms support learning in the absence of feedback. At least two ﬁndings indicate that internal signals on potential outcome are present during learning and might therefore be used to promote learning in the absence of external outcome information: humans have been shown to code the most probable outcome of nonfeedback trials into memory (Henriksson et al., 2010), and are capable of generating internal error signals that lead to activations in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a dopaminergic target region (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004). Thus, in the absence of feedback, knowledge of the structure of the environment may be used to dynamically self-generate an internal signal on probable outcome which then drives dopaminergic responses in a similar way as external outcome information. Such a mechanism would support adaptation to the environment whenever the internal model is correct or a sufﬁcient proportion of decisions receive feedback to update it.  The present experiment set out to test the hypothesis that dopaminergic target regions are activated by internal signals and therefore might contribute to learning in the absence of feedback. To this end we employed a standard information-integration category learning task. In feedback-based learning this task activates dopaminergic projection sites (Daniel and Pollmann, 2010; Nomura et al., 2007) including the striatum and dmPFC, and patients suffering from diseases impairing striatal functioning show impaired performance (Filoteo et al., 2001). Eighteen participants underwent extensive observational training on stimulus category membership in four sessions within one week. Between the observational blocks they were asked to categorize test stimuli without feedback. fMRI data was acquired during the ﬁrst and last sessions. Dopaminergic neurons have also been shown to respond to stimulus novelty (Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006; Daw et al., 2006). Thus, decreasing activations with learning might be due to the increasing familiarity of the stimuli without any relation to feedback processes. We therefore expected striatal activation during the observation of stimuli to decrease with increasing exposure to the stimuli. However, if participants are able to internally generate signals on potential errors during the test blocks, comparing correct to incorrect answers should lead to similar activation differences as comparing positive to negative feedback in feedback-based learning (see Daniel and Pollmann (2010) for results on the same task). For a further examination of the underlying mechanisms we assessed the putative internal signals on probable outcome by explicitly asking subjects to indicate after each trial how conﬁdent they were about their last decision. Within this framework the subjective conﬁdence can be interpreted as a measure of internal processes which are either rewarding themselves, since they indicate correct task performance, or a signal for the possibility of future reward. As dopaminergic neurons do not respond to the absolute magnitude of reward but to deviations from the expected reward (Schultz et al., 1997), we inserted the conﬁdence rating as outcome into a standard reinforcement learning model. This allowed us to estimate the expected outcome, that is the expected level of conﬁdence, on each trial. If the striatum is activated during observational category learning due to internal signals on the correctness of the outcome, striatal activations are expected follow the prediction error on conﬁdence, that is the difference of the expected and the actual conﬁdence.  Methods  Participants  Guericke University community participated in the experiment. All of them were right-handed as conﬁrmed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldﬁeld, 1971) and reported normal or corrected to normal vision. No participant reported a history of drug abuse, neurological injuries or psychiatric diseases and all were without pathological ﬁndings on a psychiatric screening questionnaire (SCL-90-R (Franke, 1995)). Informed written consent was obtained prior to the experiment in accordance with protocols approved by the local ethics committee. All participants received an allowance of 36 €.  Materials  The task employed in the current experiment was based on the randomization technique (Ashby and Gott, 1988). Two parallel sets of stimuli were developed to both establish independence of the results from the speciﬁc properties of the presented materials and to increase comparability to a previous experiment (Daniel and Pollmann, 2010). Half of the participants were presented with circles with an opening of 30° width, the other half with two parallel lines. Both sets varied on the dimensions linewidth and orientation, which formed the two-dimensional stimulus space. Two categories were deﬁned within this space by specifying a bivariate normal distribution for each. The category membership of a stimulus was determined by the distribution it was sampled from. To obtain the stimuli for each category, ordered pairs (x, y) were randomly sampled and linearly transformed separately for all experimental blocks so that the sample mean vector and variance–covariance matrix ﬁt the parameter values of the category distribution (listed in Table 1). These pairs were subsequently transformed to determine the line width (x∕2 pixels) and orientation (y×π∕1200 rad) of each stimulus. Transformation parameters were chosen in an attempt to equate the salience of both stimulus dimensions. The resulting category structure is depicted along with example stimuli in Fig. 1.  Procedure  All participants performed four sessions on separate days, during the ﬁrst and last of which fMRI data was acquired. The fMRI sessions were conducted spaced at an interval of one week. Between them each participant underwent two training sessions during which only behavioral data was acquired. Within each session two tasks, an observational task and a test task, were presented in blocks in an alternating manner. Each session started with a block of observational trials in which ﬁrst a category label was presented for 500 ms and was directly followed by a stimulus. The next trial began after an intertrial interval (ITI) that was sampled from an exponential distribution with a mean of 6 s [range=1–12 s] in the fMRI sessions and a mean of 3.5 s [range=1–6 s] in the training sessions. Participants were instructed to closely observe the provided examples and attend to both linewidth and orientation to learn which stimuli belong to which category. When learning by observational training, participants are often required to press the button associated with the stimulus to ensure that sufﬁcient attention is paid and that a motor association between stimuli and responses is build. Actively making right responses could induce associative learning, which is a possible confound we wanted to eliminate. Also, motor associations during observational information-integration learning do not signiﬁcantly  Table 1 Category distribution parameters.

During the fMRI sessions, two blocks of observation alternated with two blocks of testing with 50 trials in each block. In the training sessions, four blocks of observation, each with 50 trials, alternated with four blocks of testing composed of 25 trials, so that the overall amount of test trials was the same in fMRI and training sessions, however participants observed twice as many stimuli in the training sessions. A visualization of both an observational and a test trial as well as of the structure of the whole experiment is provided in Fig. 2. Please note that participants never received any feedback during the whole experiment.  Model-based analysis  Categorization tasks in which information has to be integrated predecisionally are often not well learned in the absence of feedback (Ashby et al., 2002). To determine whether participants were able to learn the experimenter-deﬁned category structure, model-ﬁtting procedures as developed by Maddox and Ashby (1993) and described in detail in Daniel and Pollmann (2010) were applied to the locations of each participant's responses in the two-dimensional stimulus space separately for each day. One model assumed that participants decided according to the optimal information-integration rule. Two additional models assumed that participants were using unidimensional rules. The latter models ﬁt the data in those participants that based their decisions either solely on the orientation or solely on the linewidth of the stimuli. Also, two models assuming participants used a conjunctive rule were ﬁt. These rules can be formulated as “Respond A if the stimuli are oriented to the right and are thick, otherwise respond B” or, for the other model, as “Respond B if the stimuli are oriented to the left and are thin, otherwise respond A”. The parameters for each model were estimated using the method of maximum likelihood (Ashby, 1992) and the Akaike information criterion (Akaike, 1974) was used as a goodness-of-ﬁt statistic to select the best ﬁtting model for each data set.  Reinforcement learning model  Behavioral data from all participants was modeled using a simple Q-learning model (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Watkins, 1989). The model consists of two input and two output nodes and assumes that participants update the value Q of a choice ct (= respond A or B) given a stimulus on each trial t (see also Rodriguez et al., 2006). Values Q were initialized to zero and updated after each trial  Fig. 1. Category structures and sample stimuli. Each square denotes the orientation and linewidth of a single stimulus from category A, a triangle those of a stimulus from Category B. The optimal decision bound is represented by the line, all stimuli above it are members of Category A, and all stimuli below it are members of Category B.

Therefore there was no further behavioral task in the observational blocks. Each observational block was followed by a block of test trials where ﬁrst a stimulus was presented for 2 s. During this period, participants were required to indicate category membership of the presented stimulus as soon as they were reasonably conﬁdent about their decision by pressing one of two response keys. After a variable delay sampled from an exponential distribution [M=2 s; range=.5–6 s], the numbers 1 to 5 appeared on the screen for 2 s. Participants were instructed to press one of ﬁve buttons to indicate how conﬁdent they were about their last decision on a scale from 1 (very unconﬁdent) to 5 (very conﬁdent). An additional button was provided to indicate that they had accidentally pressed a wrong button during the last trial. When the participants used this button, the trial was excluded from further analysis to prevent error-related activity caused by speeded responding to inﬂuence the results. After an ITI that was sampled from an exponential distribution [fMRI session: M=6 s, range=1–12 s; training session:  Fig. 2. Procedure. Each participant performed four sessions on different days, the ﬁrst and last of which were fMRI sessions. fMRI sessions included two blocks of 50 observational trials and test trials, the training sessions included four blocks of 50 observational trials and 25 test trials. An observational trial started with the presentation of category label directly followed by a stimulus. Test trials started with a stimulus to which participants were requested to respond with a decision about its category membership. After a variable delay they rated how conﬁdent they were about their last decision. No feedback was provided during the whole experiment.  3460  R. Daniel, S.

A temporal highpass ﬁlter of 1/128 Hz was applied to remove low frequency confounds and all images were smoothed by a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. All coordinates are reported in MNI space.  δt represents the prediction and is as computed as  Statistical analysis of the fMRI data  δt ¼ rt−Q t ctð  Þ  with rt being the received reward at trial t. On test trials, the value for reward that was input into the model was the reported conﬁdence level, which was linearly scaled to lie between 0 and 1. On observational trials the conﬁdence (and therefore reward) was assumed to be 1. Weights from the input nodes (stimulus from category A or B) to the output nodes (answer “A” or “B”) were updated on each trial according to the stimuli presented and choices made. As on test trials the choice could be wrong with a high conﬁdence, also weights on the path from the input node stimulus A to the output node response B and vice versa could be strengthened.  To estimate the free learning rate parameter, it was assumed that participants choose probabilistically from a softmax distribution (Daw, 2011):  P ct ¼ A ð  jQ t Að Þ; Q t Bð ÞÞ ¼  ð exp β·Q t Að Þ Þ þ exp β·Q t Bð Þ  exp β·Q t Að Þ Þ ð  ð  Þ :  The free parameter β is the inverse temperature parameter which can be interpreted as reﬂecting the randomness of the individual's choices. It cannot be assumed that observational learning follows identical rules as learning from the putative internal signal on correctness, therefore α was allowed to be different for observational and test trials. As the models were ﬁt to generate model-based parametric modulators for the imaging analysis based on the prediction error rather than comparing the ﬁt of different models, learning rate parameters were constrained to be equal across participants to regularize the individual estimates which are often noisy (Daw et al., 2006), while β was estimated individually for each participant to account for interindividual differences. All free parameters were estimated simultaneously using maximum likelihood estimation with the optimization package of the SciPy toolbox for Python (Jones et al., 2001). The inverse temperature was estimated with a mean of 4.112 (SD=1.020) across participants, the estimated learning rate was .021 during test trials and .005 during observational trials.  fMRI image acquisition and processing  Functional magnetic resonance imaging data was acquired on a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio (Erlangen, Germany) whole body 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner equipped with an 8 channel head coil. Structural images were recorded using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (ﬁeld of view (FOV)=256 mm, matrix size=256×256, 192 sagittal slices (1 mm width)). Subsequently, using a wholebrain T2⁎-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence, functional images were acquired in a single run of approximately 36 min for each imaging session (TE=30 ms, TR=2000 ms, slice thickness=3 mm, slice gap thickness=.3 mm, number of slices=32 (interleaved order), FA=80°, FOV=192 mm×192 mm, matrix size=64×64, inplane resolution=3 mm×3 mm). Processing of the functional images was performed using the statistical parametric mapping software SPM5 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). After discarding the ﬁrst ﬁve images, slice timing correction with the ﬁrst slice as reference and realignment to the mean of all images was performed. The estimated movement parameters were saved and later included as regressors of no interest in all statistical analyses. Images were normalized to MNI space (Evans et al.,  In the ﬁrst analysis step the three regressors of interest represented the observational task as well as correct and incorrect performance of the categorization task separately for both fMRI sessions. An additional regressor represented the time at which the display prompting participants to give the conﬁdence rating was presented. If the participant failed to respond on any trials an additional regressor representing the missed trials was included. The onset of each event was set to the beginning of the visual stimulation, its duration was set to an epoch with the duration of the visual stimulation (see Fig. 2) and convolved with a model of the hemodynamic response function. The regressors were ﬁt separately to the data of each participant using the general linear model (GLM). Data from separate days was treated as different sessions. To test whether the activation in dopaminergic projection sites decreases with stimulus novelty during observation, the regressors for the observational task from the ﬁrst and second fMRI sessions were submitted to a second level random effects analysis with session as a single factor. For the examination of effects of the valence of putative internal signals indicating an outcome, a 2×2 random effects ANOVA with the factors correctness and session was calculated on the regressors for correct and incorrect task performance. Three participants had to be excluded from this analysis because they committed less than two error trials in the trained session. The activation maps of these analyses were thresholded at a level of p b.05 (spatial extent of more than two contiguous voxels), and all reported clusters survived correction for multiple comparisons at the wholebrain level using familywise error rate (FWE) correction (Worsley et al., 1996).  A second GLM analysis was performed to test for the assumption that differential activations during correct and incorrect task performance are attributable to signals following a similar pattern as the prediction error signals during reinforcement learning. The two regressors for correct and incorrect task performance were replaced by a single regressor containing all categorization task events. The duration of these events was set to 2 s and a linear parametric modulation was added to the regressor. The height of this modulator corresponded to the prediction error of the trial computed as described in the section Reinforcement learning model. To increase sensitivity, this analysis was only performed in areas of interest. They comprised the caudate nucleus, the putamen and the nucleus accumbens deﬁned by the HarvardOxford subcortical structural atlas implemented in the FSL-FMRIB Software Library (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac. uk). These areas constitute the striatum and are dopaminergic target regions which have previously been reported to show activation changes as predicted by reinforcement learning models (Niv and Montague, 2009). Additionally, a sphere of 15 mm radius centered on the midbrain (MNI: x=0, y=15, z=9) was included (Aron et al., 2004), as projections from this area are considered to be the source of striatal activations. The fMRI activation map was thresholded at p b.001 and activations were considered signiﬁcant at a level of p b.05 after correction for multiple comparisons at the cluster level.

Daniel, S. Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  3461  reaction times and prediction errors as well as conﬁdence ratings across all days were calculated. The mean of these values was determined using Fisher's z-transformation and tested against zero. The backtransformed mean correlation between reaction time and conﬁdence rating was −.47 [T(17)=−13.10, p b.001]. Please note that there was no correlation between reaction times and prediction errors [r=−.005; T(17)=−.10, p =.92]. This is to be expected since the same level of conﬁdence, associated with a similar reaction time, can be higher than expected at the beginning of the experiment and lower than expected at the end of the experiment. This means that correlations between the fMRI data and the prediction error cannot be caused by reaction time differences. To determine correlations with the error rates, they were calculated separately for each block. Reaction times and conﬁdence ratings were averaged blockwise analogously. Error rates correlated signiﬁcantly with both mean conﬁdence ratings [r=−.78; T(17)=−10.80, p b.001] and mean reaction times [r =.53; T(17)=5.05, p b.001].  Model-based analysis  Participants learning an information-integration categorization task by observation often do not employ the optimal decision bound depicted in Fig. 1, but rather a suboptimal strategy relying on explicit verbal rules (Ashby et al., 2002). As different neural substrates are supposed to underlie implicit and explicit learning (Ashby and Maddox, 2005), model-ﬁtting procedures were applied to each participant's response data separately for each session to infer the most probable strategy. Results indicate that in the ﬁrst session the data of three of the 18 participants was best ﬁt by a unidimensional model, the data of eleven participants was best ﬁt by a conjunction model and only ﬁve participants employed the optimal rule. From the third session on this relationship was reversed and all but one of the participants employed the optimal rule, indicating successful learning of the experimenter-deﬁned category structure. The numbers and percentages of participants best ﬁt by each model are depicted in Fig. 3.  Functional imaging results  Comparing right and wrong answers in the categorization task  In the naïve session activations were higher for right than wrong answers mainly bilaterally in the putamen, but clusters in the caudate body, nucleus accumbens and posterior parahippocampal gyrus were also observed. In this session no clusters showed higher activation for wrong than for right answers. In the trained session this, however, was observed in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior insula and the midbrain. Here, no clusters showed higher activations for right than for wrong answers (Table 2, Fig. 5). Despite this interaction between the factors session and correctness no signiﬁcant main effect of session was observed, indicating that there was no signiﬁcant increase or decrease in activation for correct or wrong answers between sessions.  Parametric modulation by the prediction error  To estimate the trial-by-trial prediction error we ﬁt a reinforcement learning model to the participants' behavioral choices. The model estimates the expected outcome of each option given the present stimulus for every trial based on the sequence of previous outcomes. Outcome was quantiﬁed by the conﬁdence ratings as reported after each trial, and the prediction error as the difference between the actual and the expected outcome (see Methods).  Results show that within our areas of interest (striatum, midbrain) the putamen and nucleus accumbens showed linearly increasing activation with an increasing prediction error on conﬁdence. This indicates that activation was higher whenever the participant reported to be more conﬁdent on the trial than could be expected from the participants' own history of responses and lower when he or she reported to be less conﬁdent (Table 3, Fig. 6).

All results are corrected for the number of free parameters. From the third session on all but one participant used the ideal information-integration decision bound, indicating that the complex categorization task was learned after a sufﬁcient number of observational training trials in the absence of external feedback.  data of all 18 participants was subjected to a 4 ×2 ANOVA with repeated measures on session and the type of stimuli (lines or circles) as between-subjects factor. Results showed a signiﬁcant effect of session [F(2.1,34.3) =32.7, p b.001], indicating that the error rates decreased from 25.9% (SD=11.7) in the ﬁrst session to 7.3% (SD=7.0) in the fourth session. No effect of type of stimuli [F(1,16)=.98, p=.34] or interaction of session×type of stimuli [F(2.1, 34.3)=.53, p=.61] was observed. To test for possible behavioral learning effects within the test blocks the means of the ﬁrst and last 20% of trials within each block were compared using multiple T-tests. No signiﬁcant results were observed at the .05 level (uncorrected) (Fig. 4).  Correlations between reaction times, conﬁdence ratings, the prediction error and error rates  For the calculation of the prediction error, which was input as a parametric modulator into the analysis of the functional imaging data, it was assumed that conﬁdence ratings can be treated as a measure of internal signals on correctness. For this assumption to be plausible the conﬁdence ratings should correlate negatively with reaction times and error rates. For each subject Pearson's correlations between  Fig. 4.

For example, activation within the ventral striatum is modulated by social information, prediction errors in the learning of trust and subjective goals during episodic memory retrieval (Behrens et al., 2008; Delgado et al., 2005; Han et al., 2010; King-Casas et al., 2005). Also, distinct but interacting corticostriatal loops have been suggested to underlie both habit learning and goaldirected behavior and jointly contribute to producing complex behavior (Daw and Shohamy, 2008; Valentin et al., 2007).  In everyday life only a small proportion of decisions or judgment taken are followed by immediate feedback (Hogarth, 2006). With such incomplete feedback it is improbable that feedback training is the single prevalent mode of learning in ecologically valid settings. It is not clear whether the dopaminergic system also contributes to learning under circumstances where incomplete or no feedback is provided. We therefore investigated the putative involvement of striatal structures in human category learning in the complete absence of feedback. The results support the idea that these dopaminergic projection sites are activated during observational learning in a similar way as during reinforcement learning, but with respect to self-generated internal signals related to conﬁdence rather than external outcome measures.  l = left, r = right, BA = Brodman area, k = cluster size in voxels (3× 3×3 mm), max. T = maximum T-value.  Striatal activations during observational learning  Within the test phase of the present experiment, when no external information about the category membership was available, the nucleus accumbens and putamen were more activated by correct than incorrect answers. This ﬁnding parallels results from feedbackbased learning, where a similar activation pattern in striatal areas is present during the processing of feedback (for results on a feedback-based version of the same task see Daniel and Pollmann (2010)), but not during categorization. In search for the underlying processes of this result a reinforcement learning model was ﬁt to each participant's data.  According to computational theories of reinforcement learning associative links between stimuli and outcomes are formed and adjusted after each trial (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Sutton, 1988). The mechanism driving associative learning is assumed to be the prediction error, which is the difference between actual and expected outcome. Neurophysiological studies have shown that the prediction error is reﬂected in the behavior of the dopaminergic system (Schultz et al., 1997), i.e. dopaminergic midbrain neurons and their  Fig. 6. fMRI results on the prediction error.

Visualization of the activation in response to the prediction error. Separate regressors were constructed for each quartile of prediction errors in each session, e.g. the regressor for the ﬁrst quartile represents the 25 trials with the lowest prediction error of a given participant in a given session. The mean prediction errors for each quartile resulting from this procedure are given in the axis labels. Negative values indicate that the participant was less conﬁdent than expected, positive values indicate that he or she was more conﬁdent. Percent signal change for each regressor was estimated using MarsBar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net).

Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  Fig. 7. fMRI results from the observational blocks. Activations decreasing with training in the observational task from the ﬁrst to the last session were observed bilaterally in the inferior temporal cortex, in the right ventral striatum and inferior frontal gyrus. No increases in activation were observed in this contrast. Activation maps are thresholded at pFWE b.05.  projection sites. Although the ﬁrst observations on the relevance of the dopaminergic system have been performed in animal studies, its importance for reinforcement learning in humans has received considerable support from studies using fMRI. At this point it has to be noted that fMRI is mainly sensitive to local ﬁeld potentials which reﬂect integrated activity over large neural populations. This signal is assumed to arise mainly from postsynaptic processes caused by input to a region or local interneuron activity (Logothetis, 2003) and is not sensitive to the neurotransmitter system conveying the signals. Due its importance for the investigation of learning, the neurochemistry underlying fMRI activations in the midbrain (substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area) and ventral striatum during reward learning has been explicitly addressed. Pharmacological MRI has shown a positive relationship between the BOLD response measured by fMRI and striatal dopamine levels (Knutson and Gibbs, 2007; Pessiglione et al., 2006) and the parallel use of positron emission tomography showed a quantitative coupling between the BOLD response and individual variability in activity-dependent dopamine release (Schott et al., 2008). Therefore fMRI activity in the ventral striatum during studies of reward learning is most likely related to dopaminergic input to that area, but might also be inﬂuenced by other processes like glutamatergic costimulation. Despite these methodological limitations it is an interesting ﬁnding that the fMRI signal in the striatum responds to reward both during anticipation and outcome in the human striatum (Delgado, 2007; Knutson and Cooper, 2005). Results show that activity in putamen is mainly correlated with stimulus-action-dependent reward prediction (Haruno and Kawato, 2006). This ﬁnding ﬁts in well with the known anatomy of the corticostriatal systems. The putamen is connected with motor areas and therefore in a suitable location to integrate reward expectation with processes that mediate actions to obtain the reward (Haruno and Kawato, 2006; Seger et al., 2010). The ventral striatum on the other hand is connected with orbitofrontal and ventromedial cortex areas known to be involved in the processing of reward and motivation (Haber and Knutson, 2009; Seger et al., 2010). Ventral striatal activity is consistently modulated by the reward prediction error as estimated by reinforcement learning models (Brovelli et al., 2008; Daw and Doya, 2006; Dayan and Niv, 2008; Rangel et al., 2008; Schönberg et al., 2007).  In the present experiment, there were no external reward signals present, however participants reported their conﬁdence in their last decision after each trial as a conscious measure of internally generated signals indicating an assumed success or failure. During categorization, activity in the putamen and nucleus accumbens was signiﬁcantly modulated by the prediction error as estimated from a standard reinforcement learning model in which the conﬁdence rating was input into the model instead of an external reward signal. Possibly due to the postsynaptic origin of the fMRI signal no signiﬁcant modulation of midbrain activity was observed.  Previous results indicate that the knowledge of correct task performance activates the ventral striatum similarly as the receipt of primary or secondary reinforcers, if this information is conveyed by external feedback (Aron et al., 2004; Daniel and Pollmann, 2010; Rodriguez et al., 2006). The current results support the supposition that in the absence of external rewards activation in the striatum can be driven by a prediction error on conﬁdence that utilizes internally generated error signals. Findings from two major lines of research argue for the validity of this conclusion.  First, according to standard reinforcement learning models, only information that is provided by external outcome feedback is coded into memory. However, cognitive psychology has shown that humans tend to reconstruct missing information using top-down processes. These inferences are often used in the same manner as external information (White and Koehler, 2004) and the ability to distinguish between real and inferred information is limited (Roediger et al., 2001). In the case of selectively missing outcome information, humans have been shown to actively construct the most likely outcome of the trial and code it into memory (Elwin et al., 2007; Henriksson et al., 2010). At times, this approach can be misleading, so that no behavioral improvements are observable, or it can even lead to deterioration in performance due to the strengthening of false conceptions without any external evidence. However, in many cases a good internal representation of the environment is available and outcome information is scarce or costly to obtain. Under these circumstances the application of previous knowledge can be the most adaptive or only way to promote further learning.  Second, a large body of literature provides evidence for the ability of the brain to generate error signals without external feedback. The dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is known not only to respond to unfavorable performance outcomes but also pre-response conﬂict, decision uncertainty and response errors before external feedback (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004). Theoretical accounts for these experimental results have suggested that the performance monitoring system makes use of dopaminergic signals carrying reward prediction errors to determine the outcome of ongoing behavior and indicate the need for the recruitment of adaptive cognitive control mechanisms (Holroyd and Coles, 2002; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004; Rushworth and Behrens, 2008). The pharmacokinetics of dopamine in the cortex makes it improbable that fast activation changes in the dmPFC are a direct effect of dopaminergic signals from the midbrain rather than a remote effect possibly mediated by the striatum, indicating that cortical dopamine only modulates the effects of other neurotransmitter systems. However, there is a close interaction between performance monitoring reﬂected in the dmPFC, prediction errors reﬂected in striatal activation and dopamine release in the midbrain. Moreover, there are indications that performance monitoring might involve top-down modulation of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, also via pathways through the striatum (Jocham and Ullsperger, 2009; Ullsperger, 2006, 2010). The performance  R. Daniel, S. Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  3465  monitoring system can be informed by different sources about real or potential errors: it can utilize external signals, like punishments or the omission of rewards, but also internal sources, like the detection of competing response tendencies. The error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential which has a dipole source in the dmPFC (Debener et al., 2005), has a functional interrelation with a very similar event-related potential sharing the same neural sources (Gentsch et al., 2009), the feedback-related negativity (FRN). When participants are able to generate knowledge about an error without external feedback, an ERN but no FRN is observed, while information that is not available prior to the feedback elicits only the FRN (Heldmann et al., 2008). This is compatible with the assumption that, whenever an external outcome signal provides additional information, it elicits a prediction error signal. However, internal error signals are generated whenever possible before the feedback arrives, which is then used to elicit the prediction error signal.  Activation of the dmPFC and anterior insula in response to errors  In line with prediction error models, after extensive training no higher activation for correct than incorrect task performance in striatal areas was observed. At this stage, the midbrain, posterior medial prefrontal areas and the anterior insula showed higher activation in response to incorrect than correct answers. This result is also paralleled by similar ﬁndings in the literature on feedback-based learning where this activation pattern, however, is observed already early in training (Aron et al., 2004; Daniel and Pollmann, 2010; Grinband et al., 2006; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004). The dmPFC has been identiﬁed as the source of the ERN Debener et al. (2005) and together with the anterior insula has been shown to respond not only to response errors, but also to increase linearly in activation with response uncertainty (Daniel et al., 2011). Also, the anterior insula has been associated with conscious errors (Craig, 2009). Both the distinct difference in uncertainty for right and wrong answers as well as the explicit knowledge about it might arise only later in observational learning, when the knowledge of the task structure has reached a certain level of proﬁciency, while in the presence of feedback it is available as soon as the feedback is delivered. However, as there was no significant difference between the activation in response to wrong answers in the ﬁrst and last session, this observation has to be supported by data from further experiments.  Decrease in ventral striatal activation with familiarity  Activation within the nucleus accumbens decreased with training during the observation of the stimuli. This decrease cannot be elicited by any form of internal signals relating to conﬁdence since the category label was presented before the stimulus and no categorization response was required. Stimulus novelty is known to activate dopaminergic structures, and might have rewarding properties in itself or be interpreted as a cue for potential reward (Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006; Daw et al., 2006). This mechanism can have positive consequences for the organism, since it leads to exploring new options instead of exploiting those that have already proven to have a high utility. Thus valuable information about more proﬁtable options can be attained, which in turn increases future rewards. Although in the present experiment new category members were presented within each block, they were all drawn from the same distribution, which increases familiarity with the stimuli later in training. While the observed higher activations in response to correct than incorrect categorization cannot be attributed to stimulus novelty, since classiﬁcation accuracy should be higher for subjectively familiar stimuli than subjectively novel ones, ventral striatal activation during observation early in learning might signal salience and therefore support the allocation of attention to unfamiliar category members.  The use of subjective ratings as conﬁdence measure and the potential origin of the conﬁdence signal  The literature on metacognition provides examples for errors of calibration in subjective ratings on post-decisional conﬁdence in a wide variety of tasks. These range from perceptional discrimination tasks over general knowledge questions to giving eyewitness accounts and unambiguously show that subjective conﬁdence often does not predict task performance (Baranski and Petrusic, 1999; Sporer et al., 1995; Zakay and Tuvia, 1998). Depending on the speciﬁc task and its difﬁculty participants often over- or underestimate the correctness or their decisions. In the present task participants had to infer the structure of a categorization task by observing examples for each category and in subsequent test trials were asked for a conﬁdence rating immediately after their decision. Both error rates and reaction times were highly correlated with these conﬁdence ratings, indicating that for this speciﬁc task post-decisional subjective conﬁdence ratings are a sensible measure of the internal processes leading to the decision. Also, the use of a prediction error model greatly reduces the demands on the measure, since only intraindividual deviations from an expectation, which is calculated from the weighted ratings of past trials, are considered. Therefore it is only required that participants respond consistently, predominantly on trials closer together in time. Nevertheless, it has to be noted that subjective conﬁdence ratings strongly build on the human ability for metacognition, and processes that are not accessible to it are not captured by this measure (Allwood et al., 2000).  Observational category learning has been suggested to be supported by visual working memory processes and executive attention (Ashby et al., 2002). In the present experiment we observed a decrease in activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex from untrained to trained observation, an area that is often associated with working memory (D'Esposito et al., 2000) and the representation of rules and goals (Miller and Cohen, 2001). Later in training increased activation in the dmPFC, an area that is also activated by response conﬂict (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004), was observed for wrong compared to right answers. Taking these previous ﬁndings into account low conﬁdence in the present experiment might be caused by encountering exemplars that do not ﬁt the internal model of category structure held in working memory and therefore induce response conﬂict. However, as the present study was aimed at establishing the role of internal error signals in learning in the absence of feedback rather than determining their origin, these considerations can only provide hypotheses.  Possible roles of the prediction error on conﬁdence in learning  In the present experiment no reward or cognitive feedback was associated with the stimuli at any stage. Nevertheless, ventral striatal areas that are known to respond to reward prediction errors showed an increased activation whenever internal signals informed the participants that they were more conﬁdent about their decision as expected, and a decreased activation when they were less conﬁdent about their decision.  This internal signal might serve two distinct but overlapping purposes. In a learning environment where no external feedback is available, any mechanism that assesses current task performance can only be informed by internal signals. Therefore, the internal error signal might substitute for external feedback processes. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the activation patterns observed when comparing correct to incorrect task performance are equivalent to those observed when comparing positive to negative feedback on the same task when external feedback is available (see Daniel and Pollmann, 2010).  Additionally, reinforcement theories predict that detection of stimuli which change the probability of receiving reward elicits a  3466  R. Daniel, S. Pollmann / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 3457–3467  prediction error (Niv and Schoenbaum, 2008). Although participants were informed that no reward or feedback would be given within the experiment, it is plausible to assume that acquiring the ability to map the structure of the environment is inherently interpreted as increasing the probability of receiving reward within that environment (Kaplan and Oudeyer, 2004). Seeing an exemplar that can be categorized with lower conﬁdence than expected can serve as a signal that the model of the environment is wrong and needs to be updated, while higher conﬁdence than expected indicates that the state of the environment has changed toward a higher probability of reward. This interpretation predicts a stronger violation of expectations and therefore more learning whenever conﬁdent responses are followed by negative feedback. Such an overcorrection effect has been observed in the domain of explicit knowledge before (Butterﬁeld and Metcalfe, 2006).  Summary  Within the last decade, broad-ranging efforts have been made to extend results on reinforcement learning and the role of dopamine therein to the human domain. Using fMRI many results from animal studies could be replicated. The striatum has been shown to respond to reward value and prediction error both in classical and instrumental conditioning tasks (O'Doherty et al., 2007). However, in ecologically valid settings after many decisions reward or outcome information is not available or very costly to obtain. The present experiment has been conducted to explore a possible role of dopaminergic projection areas in situations where information about correctness has to be internally constructed. The results demonstrate two distinct possible mechanisms by which learning in the absence of external rewards can be supported by the striatum. In the complete absence of feedback, striatal activation follows a similar pattern in responding to the prediction error as it does during reinforcement learning, but with respect to signals based on subjective conﬁdence, that is activation is higher whenever conﬁdence is higher than expected. A potential source for these activations lies within the error monitoring system. Internally detected errors might be interpreted either as source of information on performance outcome similarly as errors detected due to external feedback, or indicate that the state of the environment, which signals the probability of future reward, has changed. The process leads to an overall higher activation in striatal nuclei during correct than incorrect task performance similarly as external performance feedback does. Additionally, when no actions are performed and stimuli are passively observed, ventral striatal activation decreases with stimulus novelty.  Outlook  Patients with Parkinson's disease are impaired on feedback-based complex category learning tasks, while observational learning is spared (Shohamy et al., 2004). This can be interpreted to show that in observational learning performance is possible without the recruitment of striatal structures (Shohamy et al., 2008). However, our results demonstrate that healthy young participants do recruit these structures during observational learning in the complete absence of feedback in at least two distinct ways, namely in response to novelty and internal signals on conﬁdence about the decision. The latter process can support learning but, in the absence of external information, also strengthen false associations. Whether each of the processes is necessary or sufﬁcient for task performance and how the processing of internal and external outcome information interacts in ecologically valid settings, where outcome information is partially available, are subject to further research.

Many physically-inspired models of these dynamics deﬁne brain states based on instantaneous measurements of regional activity. Yet, recent work in network neuroscience has provided evidence that the brain might also be well-characterized by time-varying states composed of locally coherent activity or functional modules. We study this network-based notion of brain state to understand how functional modules dynamically interact with one another to perform cognitive functions. We estimate the functional relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) by ﬁtting a pairwise maximum entropy model to each ROI's pattern of allegiance to functional modules. This process uses an information theoretic notion of energy (as opposed to a metabolic one) to produce an energy landscape in which local minima represent attractor states characterized by speciﬁc patterns of modular structure. The clustering of local minima highlights three classes of ROIs with similar patterns of allegiance to community states. Visual, attention, sensorimotor, and subcortical ROIs are well-characterized by a single functional community. The remaining ROIs aﬃliate with a putative executive control community or a putative default mode and salience community. We simulate the brain's dynamic transitions between these community states using a random walk process. We observe that simulated transition probabilities between basins are statistically consistent with empirically observed transitions in resting state fMRI data. These results oﬀer a view of the brain as a dynamical system that transitions between basins of attraction characterized by coherent activity in groups of brain regions, and that the strength of these attractors depends on the ongoing cognitive computations.  Introduction  The human brain is a complex dynamical system comprised of billions of neurons that continuously communicate with one another. Although the vast number of processing units challenges exact prediction of single neuron activity, recently developed statistical models reveal a characteristic meso-scale structure whereby sets of larger-scale brain regions display coherent activity at rest. These sets form putative functional modules characterized by locally dense functional connectivity, and include the default mode, salience, attention, fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, motor, visual, auditory, and subcortical systems (Salvador et al., 2005; Meunier et al., 2009; Yeo et al., 2011; Power  et al., 2011). Interestingly, although within-module functional connectivity is in general higher than between-module functional connectivity, these patterns ﬂuctuate dynamically over short periods of time (Ma et al., 2014; Kiviniemi et al., 2011; Watanabe et al., 2013), both at rest and during task performance (Cole et al., 2014; Mattar et al., 2015; Bassett et al., 2011, 2013b, 2015; Braun et al., 2015).  The existence of functional modules – as measured using graph theory – was ﬁrst reported nearly a decade ago (Salvador et al., 2005; Meunier et al., 2009), and these initial reports were swiftly corroborated by studies using complementary methodologies ranging from coactivation analysis to independent components analysis. A natural question following the observation of these modules was “What do they  ☆ A.A., J.M.V., and D.S.B developed the project. M.G.M. acquired the data. A.A. analyzed the data.

And how are they recruited as we go through life performing a variety of functions?” To address these questions, dynamic community detection methods were developed and applied to neuroimaging data, revealing the fact that modules reconﬁgure in support of working memory (Braun et al., 2015, 2016), reinforcement learning (Gerraty et al., 2016), visuo-motor learning (Bassett et al., 2011, 2013b, 2015), and linguistic processing (Chai et al., 2017; Doron et al., 2012a). Module reconﬁguration at rest has also been reported as a marker of aging and development (Betzel et al., 2015). These studies collectively demonstrate that module reconﬁguration is a hallmark of healthy brain function (Telesford et al., 2016), and recent evidence suggests that it is a marker that is altered in psychiatric disease, even providing an intermediate phenotype of schizophrenia (Braun et al., 2016).  Despite the extensive work demonstrating the presence and cognitive utility of dynamic module reconﬁguration, fundamental insights into the mechanisms or rules by which modules interact with one another over time have remained elusive (Mattar et al., 2015; Khambhati et al., 2016). Evidence suggests that module reconﬁguration may be driven by glutamatergic signaling (Braun et al., 2016), aﬀect and arousal Betzel et al. (2016a), and may provide a substrate for cognitive control (Khambhati et al., 2016), supporting a delicate balance between domain-general and domain-speciﬁc function (Fedorenko and Thompson-Schill, 2014a). Although these observations support the biophysical relevance of the phenotype, they do not provide computational theories for its existence. Indeed, the development of a theory explaining and predicting module dynamics would be particularly important its cognitive speciﬁcity, transmitter-level drivers, and role in psychiatric disease.  in informing studies of  imaging  resonance  One potential route towards a mechanistic theory of brain network dynamics is to consider probabilistic models that were originally developed in the ﬁeld of statistical mechanics. Pair-wise maximum entropy models (MEM), for example, have proven very useful in estimating and predicting spiking activity in neurons (Shlens et al., 2006), local ﬁeld potentials from neuronal assemblies (Tang et al., 2008), and blood oxygen level dependent signals (BOLD) from brain regions using functional magnetic (fMRI) (Watanabe et al., 2013, 2014b, 2014c). When a pair-wise MEM accurately ﬁts empirical data, it implies that the observed activation pattern can be described as a combination of each unit's independent activation rate plus the units' joint activation rates. When a pair-wise MEM does not accurately ﬁt empirical data, it implies that higher order interactions (such as triplets) or nonlinearities contribute to the observed dynamics. Importantly, pair-wise MEMs can be used to infer an energy landscape of brain activity during task performance. Here the term energy is used in an information theoretic sense, and it does not have a direct relation to metabolic energy or to a formal Hamiltonian. The energy landscape is characterized by basins of attraction representing common brain states, as well as the paths or trajectories along which the brain moves as it transitions from one basin to another. The architecture of this energy landscape has proven useful in predicting individual diﬀerences in human perception and behavior (Watanabe et al., 2014c).  In traditional applications of MEMs to neurophysiological data, a brain state is deﬁned as a pattern of activity across brain regions (or similarly, a neural state is deﬁned as a pattern of activity across neurons). However, these notions of brain state are agnostic to the patterns of communication or synchronization linking brain regions, and therefore are unable to address the question of how one pattern of coherent activity could evolve into another pattern of coherent activity. To address this question, we explicitly deﬁne a network state as the pattern of module allegiance across brain regions, and we use this deﬁnition to examine transitions between network states. We test the hypothesis that mesoscale structure in dynamic functional connectivity patterns is well explained by pairwise interactions between communities. The null hypothesis that we seek to reject is that such patterns cannot be explained without contributions from higher-order interac 365  tions between communities. To test this hypothesis, we construct a time-dependent network by linking 10 regions of interest by the low frequency (0.06–0.19 Hz) wavelet coherence between their time series in a given time window. We use a community detection algorithm to identify groups of brain regions that show stronger coherence with one another than they do to other groups. We refer to these groups as network communities, and we ﬁt the MEM to each ROI's time series of the state of co-occurrence in the same community with other ROIs. This approach enables us to identify network states that form local energy minima, as well as features of the energy landscape surrounding these minima. More generally, this approach highlights the dynamic functional roles that diﬀerent ROIs play in network states and the transitions between them.  Our results reveal the presence of local minima on the energy landscape, many of which are characterized by the activation of a single community. Interestingly, diﬀerent ROIs show diﬀerent patterns of membership to these single community states. Visual, attention, sensorimotor, and subcortical ROIs tend to form a single functional community (Class-I). The remaining ROIs form the putative executive control network (Class-II) and the putative default mode and salience network (Class-III). To further study these dynamics, we modeled the transitions of single community states over the landscape of the states's energy via a random walk process. Our numerical simulations of basin transitions using an MCMC random walk predict empirical frequencies and probabilities of state transitions with high ﬁdelity for Class-I and Class-III ROIs, and with lower ﬁdelity for executive control (Class-II) ROIs. In addition, empirically the executive control ROIs also display higher entropy energy landscapes, linking diverse state classes, and utilizing uniform transition probabilities across basins. These features support the unique role of executive control regions in diversifying the brain's dynamic functional repertoire across many cognitive processes via their rich and ﬂexible dynamic functional ﬁngerprint.  Results  Distillation of drivers of resting state dynamics  Maximum entropy models are optimally constructed to ﬁt patterns of interactions between relatively few brain regions. We therefore sought to distill the drivers of resting state dynamics to a few wellchosen regions of interest. Speciﬁcally, in resting state fMRI data acquired from 20 healthy adult individuals in a multiband imaging sequence, we extract 10 regions of interest in a data-driven fashion as centroids of independent components (see Methods). These regions include the cuneus, precuneus, precentral gyrus, caudate, right and left rostral middle frontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and pars triangularis (see Table 1). We use these regions as proxies of their respective cognitive systems, spanning visual, dorsal attention, sensorimotor, basal ganglia, executive control, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, default mode, and salience systems, respectively. For explicit maps of each independent component, and the representative region chosen, see SI3.  Table 1 Regions of interest and their corresponding ICN.  ICN 1. Visual 2. Dorsal Attention (Attn) 3.

Ashourvan et al.  NeuroImage 157 (2017) 364–380  Maximum entropy model of network states  Our goal  is to understand how the brain transitions between network states. We focus our attention on the transitions characterized by changes in the community structure of the network, or the organization of putative functional modules. This focus is motivated by a growing literature demonstrating (i) the presence of network communities at rest, which map on to known cognitive systems (Salvador et al., 2005; Meunier et al., 2009; Power et al., 2011; Yeo et al., 2011), and (ii) changes in the integration or segregation of these communities during task performance (Bassett et al., 2011, 2013b, 2015; Cole et al., 2014; Braun et al., 2015). Based on these emerging lines of research, we deﬁne network states based on regions' congruent community allegiance. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁt a MEM to the binarized community allegiance probability of region i where i ) with the other 9 ROIs. This approach assesses the community-based interactions between a single ROI and all others, thus signiﬁcantly reducing the space of possible states from the total number of partitions of an n-element set (the Bell number 115975) to only 2 N−1 local single community states, and thereby increasing model accuracy (Grimaldi, 2006).  ( = 1, 2, ‥,  (=512)  In SI1 we discuss the goodness of ﬁt of the model in detail. Brieﬂy, we observe that the pairwise MEM oﬀers a statistically supported model of observed dynamics, as it accounts for ≈70% of the entropy that is not captured by the ﬁrst-order model. Interestingly, the accuracy of the pairwise MEM plateaus as a function of the amount of data (i.e., the number of subjects) used to ﬁt the model.  Local minima in the brain's functional energy landscape  After ﬁtting the MEM to regional congruence in community allegiance across all subjects, we characterized the resultant energy landscapes of all ROIs. We identiﬁed 3–5 local minima states from the landscape of a single ROI, for a total of M = 25 unique local minima states across all ROIs. We note that each state represents the set of brain regions that are commonly allied together in a single community (see Fig. 2A). Because ROIs with strong functional interactions are  N  expected to display congruent membership in local minima states, we performed hierarchical clustering on the pattern of ROI allegiance to local minima states. Interestingly, we observed that ROIs divided neatly into three separate classes. Class-I was composed of occipital, parietal, and subcortical ROIs in the visual, attention, sensorimotor, and basal ganglia systems. Class-II was composed of fronto-parietal, and frontal ROIs in the right and left executive control network and the rostral middle frontal systems. Finally, Class-III was composed of medial and opercular ROIs in the dorsal medial prefrontal, default mode, and salience systems.  Although we identiﬁed a total of 25 unique local minima states across all ROI landscapes, the majority of these states approximated single communities consisting largely of ROIs from one or two identiﬁed classes. For example as see in Fig. 2A, local minima states 1–3 are characterized by congruent community allegiance of Class-II and Class-III ROIs. Hierarchical clustering of local minima states based on their similarity (as measured by the Hamming distance between the local minima states) underlines several groups of very similar local minima states, where each group is characterized by a few common ROIs. Interestingly, these results highlight the tendency of Class-I and Class-III ROIs to display incongruent (or dissimilar) community allegiance, whereas Class-II ROIs form communities with ROIs across both classes.  Basins surrounding local energy minima  In the previous section, we identiﬁed minima of the energy landscape underpinning module dynamics, and we further described the clustering of these minima states into groups with similar regional proﬁles of allegiance to dynamic modules. These minima were located at the locally least-energetic position on the energy landscape. However, it is also intuitively of interest to study the group of states neighboring each local minimum since the shape of the surrounding low-energy basin eﬀects the state transition dynamics over the basin. The brain states are expected to rapidly converge to the local minima in a smooth, steep, funnel-like basin, whereas over the larger rough basins the systems displays frustrated dynamics; i.e. it is diﬃcult to reach local  Fig. 1. Schematic of local community allegiance energy landscape estimation. (A) Fluctuations of the strength of functional connectivity between brain regions over time manifests as reconﬁguration of the brain's functional modules. (B) The state of the community allegiance of a single region (e.g., node A) with the rest of the brain regions (‘1′ when both pairs appear in the same community (yellow nodes) and ‘0′ otherwise (blue nodes)) are then used to establish local functional module allegiance states. (C) We ﬁt a MEM using these allegiance state vectors and estimate the functional interaction strength between brain regions to construct an energy landscape of regional community allegiance states.  366  A. Ashourvan et al.  NeuroImage 157 (2017) 364–380  Fig. 2. Local Minima in the Brain's Functional Energy Landscape. (A) We identiﬁed M = 25 unique local minima states characteristic of the time series of a region's allegiance to putative functional modules over time. Here, each state represents the set of regions that are commonly allied together in a single community. Using hierarchical clustering, we identiﬁed three classes of ROIs with similar patterns of community allegiance across these local minima. Class-I (blue), Class-II (red), and Class-III (green) branches are shown in the dendrogram on the right side of the matrix and visualized on the brain images as ROIs. Using the same clustering technique applied to the matrix transpose, we identiﬁed several classes of minima states with common ROI members, denoted by the colored branches on the top of the matrix. ICN labels and their corresponding Lausanne atlas ROI are provided in Table 1. (B) In addition to identifying the unique minima states, for each ROI we also calculated the basin size of local minima states as the fraction of the number of basin states to the number of total possible states. Note that the sizes of the analogous basins slightly vary across some ROIs since each local energy landscape is estimated using only 9 out of the 10 ROIs. (C) Calculating the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between any two ROIs' vectors of basin size across minima states revealed groups of ROIs with similar energy landscapes. (D) The basin states' average vectors highlight the unifying features of the basin states, i.e. omni-present core ROIs (average value 1), commonly present core ROIs (average value between 0.5 and 1) that tend to be among the minima states' member ROIs, and ﬁnally the ROIs with incongruent membership (average value <0.5). (E) The average dwell time of minima state's basins (all ROIs combined) grows exponentially with respect to the basins' size. The close exponential ﬁt (red curve) highlights this relationship.  minima because of the large number of peaks and troughs. To study this larger group of states, we deﬁned basin states of local minimum A to be any state from which one can travel down the steepest gradient of the energy landscape (using a steep search algorithm) to reach the local minimum A (see Methods for details). Using this deﬁnition, we estimated any basin's size as the ratio of the number of basin states to the total number of possible states. Since the energy landscapes of the community allegiance states are estimated locally, the estimated landscape for each ROI naturally diﬀers from all the other landscapes due to its reduced dimension (N-1). Therefore the size of the analogous basins of attraction can appear marginally diﬀerent across ROIs. Importantly, this estimate of basin size is not the same as an estimate of basin depth. We observed that the largest basin – making up to >60% of the total state space of Class-I ROIs – surrounded minima state #17, which was characterized by congruent allegiance of visual, sensorimotor, basal ganglia, and attention systems (see Fig. 2B). The large size of this basin suggested that these systems had stronger than average intrinsic functional interactions, perhaps due to the ongoing visual  ﬁxation that is characteristic of the resting state with eyes open.  To better understand the anatomical drivers of observed module dynamics, we next studied which brain regions contributed most to basin states surrounding each minimum. To address this goal, we began by counting the number of times that each basin state appeared in a single region's proﬁle. Using this information, we deﬁned for each ROI the number of basin states seen by that ROI as a fraction of the total number of possible states. In other words, associated with each ROI was a vector that represented the fraction of its states that were identiﬁed in the basin of each of the minima states. Interestingly, the identiﬁed classes of ROIs seemed to show similar proﬁles, as measured by a Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between any two ROIs' vectors (see Fig. 2C). Moreover, with the exception of a few states (e.g., states 7 and 8), the ROIs from the same class appear with the same frequency between diﬀerent basin states; in Fig. 2D, this eﬀect is evident through the comparable average allegiance values of ROIs from the same class. To understand how local minima states with large basin sizes eﬀect the state transition dynamics, we calculated the dwell time of each ROI  367  A. Ashourvan et al.  NeuroImage 157 (2017) 364–380  ( < 10  in a given basin. Intuitively, a dwell time is the length of time in which an ROI remains in a given local minima's basin. We observed that the size of the basin was positively related to dwell time within the basin (see Fig. 2E). We note that on average the dwell time of each basin is ), except for state #17 which displays only a few seconds ) although the variance is large twice the average dwell time std ). In addition, Supplementary ﬁgures SI1-2 also reveal ( the relatively rough surface of the state #17 basin, marked by the presence of several prominent peaks and troughs. Together these results suggest that close functional relationships between ROIs (especially between Class-I ROIs) promotes frustrated dynamics over large basins, marked by coherent activity in Class-I ROIs.  = 31.41  secs  secs  (21.46  secs  The frequency of transitioning between basins  After identifying local minima states and the times spent dwelling within their basin, we next turned to examining the frequencies with which the brain transitioned between single community states to estimate an ROI's transition proﬁle. Because each time point of the subjects' dataset is often associated with two or more single community states, we estimated the frequency of transitioning from one basin to another, separately for each ROI's energy landscape (see Fig. 3). Speciﬁcally, after establishing the dynamic functional community organization and the local community allegiance states from the empirical data, we identiﬁed the basins that each state belongs to. Next for each ROI, the empirical basin transition frequency from basin A to B was calculated as the number of state transitions from basin states A to B across the scan, and the empirical basin transition probability was determined by normalizing the transition frequencies: dividing by the total number of transitions from A to all basins. Importantly, we refer to this quantity as the basin transition probability, rather than the probability of transitioning between local minima states, because the measure counts transitions between peripheral areas of basins, rather than only counting transitions from basin centers. For Class-I ROIs that include occipital, parietal, and subcortical areas in the visual, attention, sensorimotor, and basal ganglia systems, we observed that the basin of minima state #17 (characterized by the largest basin size and by congruent allegiance of visual, sensorimotor, basal ganglia, and attention systems) was also the most frequently visited basin. These results once again highlight the strength of this attractor state, which in turn echoes the close functional interactions between Class-I ROIs. For Class-II ROIs including fronto-parietal and frontal areas in the right and left executive control network and the rostral middle frontal systems, we observed a more uniform distribution of transition frequencies between basins. This more uniform transition probability architecture is also characteristic of Class-III ROIs, which are composed of medial and opercular areas in the dorsal medial prefrontal, default mode, and salience systems.  To have a better understanding of the ﬂuidity of the state transitions for each ROI, we measured the level of unpredictability (i.e., entropy) of each ROI's community allegiance states. We calculated the entropy of allegiance state probabilities for each ROI separately. The signiﬁcantly higher entropy of the Class-II ROI landscapes (p < 0.01 bootstrap) provides converging evidence of the highly dynamic community organization of ECN ROIs where their single community states more ﬂuidly transition between local minima state basins as highlighted in Fig. 3 (right).  Next, we asked whether we could use the maximum entropy model results to predict the empirically observed transition frequencies, as a conﬁrmation of the modeling framework. To derive theoretically expected transition frequencies, we simulated the transition dynamics between basins using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method over the energy landscape of each ROI using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (see Methods for details). A secondary beneﬁt of this approach was that it allowed us to identify groups of brain regions  368  whose module dynamics were not well-predicted by a random walk model, and therefore might require consideration of more highly constrained walk dynamics. In general, we observed that simulated and empirical transition frequencies were positively correlated with one another (average slope β = 1.09, p < 0.0002 except LECN for which p = 0.02), oﬀering initial validation of the MEM approach. Interestingly, however, this relationship displayed diﬀerential strength across the three classes of ROIs (see as Fig. 4A and SI2 for more details), indicating that some transition frequencies were less well characterized by pairwise interactions (the assumption of the MEM) and/or by random walks across the underlying energy landscape (the assumption of the MCMC). In particular, Class-I ROIs showed the strongest relationships between the simulated and empirical transition frequencies; Class-III ROIs showed signiﬁcant but weaker correlations and Class-II in general showed insigniﬁcant correlations after FDR correction for multiple comparisons. In the earlier MEM analysis, the functional activity of Class-II ROIs were well ﬁt, yet the transition frequencies here ﬁnd low similarity between the model and empirical data. This suggests that a simple random walk model fails to capture the state transition behavior of putative areas in the executive control networks, which form the bulk of Class-II ROIs.  Finally, we asked whether the empirical transition frequencies could be predicted by simpler statistics drawn from the maximum entropy model (and associated energy landscape) and not requiring the full MCMC modeling approach. In general, we observe a positive relationship between the size of a basin and the transition frequency of that basin: the brain tends to transition into and out of large basins. This eﬀect is strongest in Class-I and Class-III ROIs, and weaker for Class-II ROIs (Fig. 4B). Intuitively, while the basin size is likely to be a strong predictor of transition frequency, another important consideration lies in the energy barriers between basins. That is, are two basins separated by a low hill or by a high mountain on the energy landscape? To clarify the relative predictive power of basin size versus barriers between basins, we estimated the energy barrier between pairs of basins by identifying saddle nodes on the energy landscape (see Methods). Importantly, we could estimate these barriers either by considering symmetric transition frequency estimates (averaging both transitions into and out of a state), or by considering the full transition frequency matrix with small asymmetries. We did not observe any consistent the energy barrier and the empirically observed transition frequencies (Fig. 4C), particularly in the case of the asymmetric estimates (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that module dynamics are best explained by basin size rather than by barriers between basins.  trend linking the size of  Non-stationarity of BOLD FC timeseries  In this study we assume that statistical interdependence between regions is a reﬂection of their functional connectivity, and that the ﬂuctuations in FC (or dynamic FC) are a true reﬂection of changes in the underlying functional relationships between brain regions. However it possible that these changes are in fact only artifactual (e.g. noise) and the true underlying FC process is a non-stationary one. Several studies have proposed statistical approaches to test for the presence of non-stationarity, including the assessment of the variance of the FC time series (Sakoğlu et al., 2010), test statistics based on the FC time series' Fourier-transform (Handwerker et al., 2012), linear (e.g., variance of correlation series (Hindriks et al., 2016)) and nonlinear test statistics (Zalesky et al., 2014), among others (Chang and Glover, 2010; Keilholz et al., 2013; Laumann et al., 2016). The bulk of the evidence points to the non-stationary nature of BOLD FC, a conclusion that is consistent with recent work suggesting that nonstationarity in BOLD functional connectivity reﬂects changes in ongoing cognitive processes supporting learning, working memory function, linguistic processing, and executive function (Bassett et al., 2011; Braun et al., 2015; Chai et al., 2016, 2017; Hutchison et al., 2013a).  A.

(A) The circular graph represents the empirical basin transition frequency pattern of a sample Class-II ROI representing the left hemisphere executive control network (LECN). Each color coded dot along the circumference of the circular graph represents one of the 25 local minima states. Lines linking local minima states indicate empirically estimated transition frequencies between local minima states's basins; the width of the line is proportional to the empirically estimated frequency of that transition. The length of the lines and the width of the vertical colored bars contain no quantitative information and they serve only to enhance the visualization of the connected minima states. Transition frequencies are separately normalized for ROIs by dividing by the largest transition frequencies calculated for each ROI.

(B) The empirical basin transition frequency pattern for two sample ROIs from Class-I (Visual) and Class-III (DMN). Note that unlike LECN, the basin transition frequency pattern of the visual ROI is heavily skewed towards a single state (that is, state 17, which we describe in greater detail in the body of the text).  Nonetheless, some of these reports are inconclusive, mainly because test statistics are commonly compared against that of null (stationary) time series and creating such time series with matching covariance structure, spectral properties, and stationary FC to this day remains a challenge (Hindriks et al., 2016).  Here we explored an alternative approach to answer this question, namely by comparing the estimated interaction matrices from the original data to that of an appropriate null model. Speciﬁcally, we created surrogate time series with preserved covariance structure using the method proposed by (Laumann et al., 2016), which builds the time series from stationary white noise while matching the covariance structure and spectral proﬁle of the empirical data. Next, we estimated the energy landscape of the community allegiance states from the surrogate data. In Fig. 5B, we display estimated local minima states of this surrogate data as well as the corresponding size of their basins, and the basin similarity correlation matrix. Visually, we can note that these results look quite diﬀerent from the estimated empirical results reported in the manuscript. To statistically test this observation, we performed a non-parametric statistical test (bootstrap N = 600) to  measure (i) the correlations between the Jij interaction matrices (all possible pairs) estimated from the null time series, and (ii) the correlations between the Jij interaction matrices estimated from a single set of null time series and that of the true data. We observed that the Jij interaction matrices derived from separate sets of null time series were signiﬁcantly p( ≈ 0) more similar to one another than Jij interaction matrices derived from the true time series (Fig. 6).  The observed dissimilarity between the Jij matrices estimated from the null and empirical time series suggests that there are fundamental diﬀerences in the null and empirical energy landscapes. This suggestion is supported by additional tests examining simple summary statistics including state existence, basin size, and basin dwell time. First, we observe that 6 out of the 25 local minima states identiﬁed from the BOLD time series are present less than expected (one–tailed, p < 0.05, N = 1046 iterations) in the null energy landscapes (Fig. 7A). Importantly, minima states 14 and 15 are signiﬁcant at an α = 0.05, with an FDR correction for multiple comparisons (see Fig. 7A); they also remain signiﬁcant after a stricter Bonferroni correction. Second, we observe signiﬁcant (one–tailed, p < 0.05, N = 1046 iterations)  369  A. Ashourvan et al.  NeuroImage 157 (2017) 364–380  Fig. 4. Empirical versus predicted frequencies of transitioning between basins. (A) We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation over the energy landscape of each ROI via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate theoretically predicted frequencies of transitioning between basins of local community allegiance dynamics of ROIs. The normalized empirical and model transition frequencies were signiﬁcantly correlated for Class-I(left) and Class-III (middle) ROIs but not for Class-II(right) ROIs.

These net frequencies are strongly correlated with the size of the basin surrounding each minima state, particularly for Class-I and Class-III ROIs.

We also show their basins (color coded in red and blue, respectively) as well as the saddle point between the two basins (VS). Any state transition trajectory from basin A to B travels through at least one state with energies higher than the saddle point state (unless the trajectory includes the saddle point state). Therefore the energy barrier for getting out of the local minima state is calculated by subtracting the energy values between the saddle state and the local minima state. The symmetric energy barrier between two local minima states is calculated as the minimum of the two energy barriers. Although we have only examined the basin transition frequency in (A–D), the results are similar for basin transition probabilities since the two are related to one another by a simple normalization factor (see SI2 Fig. 2).  changes in the dwell times as well as in the basin size of several local minima states (Fig. 7B-C). Minima states 9 and 13 in Fig. 7B and minima state 9 in Fig. 7C are also signiﬁcant at an α = 0.05, with an FDR correction for multiple comparisons; they also remain signiﬁcant after a stricter Bonferroni correction. These data support the notion that the null and empirical energy landscapes are fundamentally diﬀerent from one another.  It is worth noting that the presence of ﬂuctuations in FC and the presence of functional states are not deﬁnitive signs of non-stationarity in the underlying process. In fact, a weak-sense stationary process, such as a stationary stochastic Markov process, can display dynamic FC and state transitions over short timescales, while appearing stationary when studied over long timescales (Liegeois et al., 2017). Therefore, when testing for stationarity of a given timeseries, it is advised to create a null with properties such as linearity and Gaussianity that are analogous to the original timeseries. Here we demonstrated that empirical interactions estimated using a pairwise MEM were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than those observed in a null with matching covariance structure and spectral proﬁle (Laumann et al., 2016). These diﬀerences are consistent with the presence of non-stationarity in the empirical data, but they could also be explained by diﬀerences in linearity and Gaussianity of the null model. Further work is necessary to determine  whether the empirical time series are in a weak sense stationary or indeed non-stationary.  Discussion  In this work we aimed to characterize the dynamic organization of large-scale brain networks and to provide a probabilistic model of the manner in which the brain transitions between large-scale functional states. Drawing on recent work demonstrating the fundamental nature of modular organization in large-scale functional dynamics (Sporns and Betzel, 2016), we deﬁned these states via local patterns of brain regions' allegiance to network communities (Bassett et al., 2015). We utilized the maximum entropy model (MEM) framework to estimate the probability of occurrence of these states as well as each ROI's cooccurrence with another ROI in the same community. We introduced a novel deﬁnition of brain state that allowed us to uncover functional modules that drive large-scale brain functional dynamics. In addition, we studied the inter-ICN relationship while prior work mainly focused on the intra-ICN landscape. Our results highlight the existence of three classes of ROIs with similar functional relationships. Visual, attention, sensorimotor, and subcortical ROIs tend to form a single functional community (Class-I). The remaining ROIs form the putative executive  370  A. Ashourvan et al.

In addition to identifying these distinct classes of ROIs that display inherently diﬀerent dynamics within putative functional modules, we also studied the probabilities and frequencies with which the brain transitioned from one pattern of functional modules to another pattern of functional modules. By modeling basin transitions using an MCMC random walk, we predicted empirical probabilities of state transitions with high ﬁdelity for Class-I and Class-III ROIs, and with lower ﬁdelity for executive control (Class-II) ROIs. Interestingly, executive control ROIs also displayed higher entropy energy landscapes, linking diverse state classes, and utilizing uniform transition probabilities across basins, consistent with their unique role in diversifying the brain's dynamic functional repertoire. More generally, the relatively good ﬁt of the MEM suggests that the complex patterns of network module dynamics can be described simply by pairwise interactions between regional allegiances to communities. In contrast to the widespread interest in network statistics, our results provide the  critical ﬁrst steps towards a probabilistic model of brain networks dynamics.  Model-based versus data-driven approaches to studying dynamic functional connectivity  One of our fundamental aims in performing this work was to understand the dynamic functional interactions between large-scale brain networks driven by underlying neurophysiological processes at smaller spatial scales (Logothetis, 2008). While many empirical and data-driven approaches are currently being developed and utilized (Hutchison et al., 2013b), model-based approaches comprise a relatively smaller literature largely including eﬀorts in the Virtual Brain (Roy et al., 2014) and dynamic causal modeling (Stephan and Roebroeck, 2012) communities. Development of such approaches is imperative to our understanding of the role that network dynamics play in attention (Kucyi et al., 2016), learning (Bassett et al., 2015),  Fig. 6.

These data support the notion that the null and empirical energy landscapes are fundamentally diﬀerent from one another.  language (Doron et al., 2012b), and memory (Braun et al., 2015), and their evolution through development (Chai et al., 2017) or alteration in psychiatric disease (Siebenhuhner et al., 2013; Weiss et al., 2011; Du et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2015) and neurological disorders (Khambhati et al., 2015; Burns et al., 2014). Here we build on a maximum entropy based modeling framework that has been previously utilized in the context of functional activation proﬁles (rather than functional connectivity proﬁles) (Watanabe et al., 2013, 2014b, 2014c). We adapt this approach to study the functional energy landscape of network states and their associated attractor state dynamics. Functional brain states are deﬁned based on regional allegiance to dynamic functional communities, providing insight into the physiological patterns of synchronization between groups of brain regions. This model-based approach revealed notable reductions in the distance (≈70%) between the estimated and empirical distributions of patterns of ICN functional modules from resting state data by considering interactions between all pairs of regions. Therefore, the pairwise MEM suggests that the observed patterns of BOLD-derived ICNs dynamic functional communities are partly due to their intrinsic tendency to synchronize with one another, likely across known structural connections (Watanabe et al., 2013).  Attractor communities in dynamic brain networks  Our modeling framework is explicitly based on the role that single regions play in the meso-scale organization of dynamic communities. We ﬁt a maximum entropy model to each ROI's time series of cooccurrence with another ROI in the same community. This approach enables us to identify the dynamic functional roles that diﬀerent ROIs play in network state dynamics. When combining information from all ROIs, this approach identiﬁes network states that form local energy minima or in essence single community attractors. Indeed, while each region displays a distinct proﬁle of activation across the energy minima, several groups of regions also show similarities in their activation proﬁles. We refer to these groups as classes, and observe that each single community attractor tended to contain all members of one or two ROI classes: Class-II ROIs (largely comprising executive control regions) coupled with Class-I or Class-III ROIs, whereas Class-I and Class-III ROIs coupled infrequently. This observation suggests that regions in the executive control network play unique roles in mesoscale functional dynamics (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014), forming transient control hubs that can guide interactions between large-scale  functional networks (Mattar et al., 2015; Bassett et al., 2015; Braun et al., 2015; Cole et al., 2013).  Dimensionality of mesoscale brain dynamics  Any assessment of brain states is faced with the question of “So, how many are there?” Most prior studies suggests that brain dynamics can be distilled into between 4 and 7 states at the coarsest level of inquiry (Allen et al., 2012; Britz et al., 2010; Khanna et al., 2015; Shirer et al., 2012b). Yet, evidence from electrophysiology points to the presence of so-called microstates, of which there may be many more and which can last for very short periods of time (Khanna et al., 2015; Vakorin et al., 2011). The repertoire of states available to the brain is therefore arguably more accurately characterized as a hierarchy, with a few coarse states composed of multiple levels of more transient (temporally localized) and focal (spatially localized) states. This complex organization requires computational and data-science approaches (Turk-Browne, 2013) such as the one that we develop in this work. Here, we uncover 25 states, as deﬁned by local minima in the energy landscape of module dynamics during the resting state, and the fact that basin size is positively correlated with transition probability and with transition frequency indicates that the landscape tends to be dominated by large basins. Once the brain transitions out of the large basin, there is a much higher probability that the system will transition back to the large basin than to a small basin. Each state is characterized by a distinct pattern of module allegiance embodied by diﬀerent brain regions. The identiﬁcation of these states oﬀers a complementary view to that provided by prior work, which has described changes in module allegiance of brain regions over time (Bassett et al., 2011, 2013b, 2015; Braun et al., 2015; Mattar et al., 2015) and speculated on the cognitive drivers of these changes as regions critical for domain-general processing (Fedorenko and Thompson-Schill, 2014b), associative processing (Bassett et al., 2013b), cognitive control (Bassett et al., 2015), and cognitive ﬂexibility (Braun et al., 2015). While regional roles are important, the states themselves may also oﬀer insights into what cognitive processes are occurring, either in parallel or in series (Mattar et al., 2015). It would be interesting in future work to manipulate cognitive processes via task performance and determine the direct relationship between local minima states and mental states (AndrewsHanna et al., 2014; Kucyi et al., 2016; Betzel et al., 2016b; Gu et al., 2017).  372  A. Ashourvan et al.  NeuroImage 157 (2017) 364–380  Cognitive control, ﬂexibility, and task-switching  Executive control networks in fronto-parietal cortices play a unique role in the pattern of results that we uncover here. Executive ROIs display states of module allegiance that are unlike the states displayed by other brain areas. Moreover, our results suggest that the brain transitions in and out of these states in a manner that is not as well-ﬁt by an MCMC random walk on the observed energy landscape, suggesting a peculiar complexity of dynamics. Interestingly, executive ROIs also display higher entropy energy landscapes, link diverse state classes, and utilize uniform transition probabilities across basins. These ﬁndings are particularly interesting when viewed in the context of executive control function, and its instantiation in brain network architecture. Executive function supports the ability to link information to solve problems, inhibit inappropriate behaviors, and transition between tasks and states (Royall et al., 2002). Recent work suggests that these capabilities occur via dynamic interactions between largescale neural circuits (Dajani and Uddin, 2015; Cole et al., 2013), often taking the form of competitive or cooperative dynamics (Cocchi et al., 2013) between putative functional modules (Mattar et al., 2015). Indeed, recent evidence points to fronto-parietal cortices as hubs of ﬂexible modular reconﬁguration during task states (Bassett et al., 2013b), that are directly correlated with individual diﬀerences in learning (Bassett et al., 2011, 2015), memory (Braun et al., 2015), and cognitive ﬂexibility (Braun et al., 2015). Our current results complement these ﬁndings by suggesting that the baseline functional architecture of executive regions supports their role during task performance: (i) the high entropy energy landscapes of these regions can support highly transiently dynamics, and (ii) the uniform transition probabilities can support the integration (cooperative) and segregation (competitive) of many other cognitive systems. It is interesting to speculate that these unique features of executive region dynamics observed at rest may in part be driven by white matter microstructure, consistent with recent evidence pointing towards a structural driver of executive function (Gu et al., 2015).  Methodological considerations  For computational reasons, we have reduced the dimensionality of the data in two ways. First, we chose a small number of ROIs n( = 10) whose time series oﬀer a reasonable representation of the resting state networks from which they are derived (see Methods). However, because of this down-sampling procedure, we are not sensitive to dynamic ﬂuctuations within a network. Future work using larger datasets could explore whether higher order ICA decompositions oﬀer additional insights into ﬁner-scale dynamics underlying the functional hierarchy that we observe here. Second, we ﬁt the MEM to each ROI's community allegiance time series, rather than to all ROI pairs' allegiance at the same time. Future work could aim to develop novel optimization-based methods to characterize the energy landscape of the global structure.  Here in the main manuscript, we present the results based on ROI time series to maximize interpretability and anatomical speciﬁcity of claims. Yet, a single estimated time series cannot exactly capture the activity of an entire network. To address this limitation, it is useful to consider the utility of examining the back-projection of the component itself. In the supplementary section entitled ‘Energy Landscape of ICA Components’, we examine the ICA back-reconstructed time series and observe results that are consistent with those we obtained from the ROI time series.  Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that dynamic FC displays signiﬁcant covariance with head motion after standard motion correction (Burgess et al., 2016). Therefore it is critical to understand the robustness of the reported results to any residual noise. The converging results from the ROI-based and ICA back-reconstructed time series (presented in SI-5) suggest that any residual eﬀect of head motion does  373  not simply explain the results and interpretations provided in this paper.  A distinct set of important methodological considerations relates to the dynamic community structure that we estimate as the input to the regional MEMs. We estimate dynamic community structure using a modularity maximization approach (Lancichinetti and Fortunato, 2011), which has an implicit structural resolution parameter that can be used to tune the number of communities. Following prior work, we employ the default parameter value of unity (Bassett et al., 2013a), and it would be interesting in future to study the changes in energy landscapes that occur at diﬀerent spatial and temporal scales (Mucha et al., 2010). Moreover, following the extraction of dynamic community structure, we binarize the pair-wise allegiance probabilities, necessarily losing sensitivity to ﬁne-scale network perturbations of nodes that are loosely associated with a single community. However, since we mainly focus on the most robust attractor communities, the computational beneﬁts of the reduced state space following binarization outweighs the cost associated with this lack of sensitivity.  It is important to note that while we apply the maximum entropy model to study the relationships between functional connections estimated with a Pearson correlation, the results do not address the question of whether higher-order (>2nd) interactions exist in functional brain networks. This question requires a diﬀerent statistical approach, such as explicitly ﬁtting higher-order MEMs to activity time series rather than functional connections. Prior work on this question has suggested that while there may be a few higher-order relationships (Ganmor et al., 2011), most of the variance in neurophysiological activity can be accounted for by pairwise MEMs both at the level of BOLD (Watanabe et al., 2013) and at the level of neuronal activity (Schneidman et al., 2006).  We performed an additional test to assess the likely aﬀect of head motion on the modeled dynamics. We examined the Spearman correlation coeﬃcient between the mean framewise displacement and the total basin transition frequency between all pairs of basins, assessed over subjects. We observed no statistically signiﬁcant relationship between total basin transition frequency and mean framewise displacement, either when considering all sessions for all subjects, or when considering across-session averages (all p > 0.05, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons across regions). These data suggest that the frame-wise displacement is a poor predictor of basin transition dynamics.  Conclusions and future directions  Here we present a viable probabilistic model of dynamic reconﬁguration in functional brain networks estimated from resting state fMRI. By representing a brain state as a pattern of functional interactions between brain regions, we reveal structured transitions between a ﬁnite number of brain states that act as basins of attraction. Critically, each basin is characterized by a speciﬁc set of functional modules: groups of brain areas that display coherent BOLD time series. By characterizing the energy landscape surrounding these basins, we accurately predict the manner in which the brain transitions between states, and we uncover novel markers of the functional role that executive regions play in guiding these transitions. These eﬀorts lay the groundwork for empirical investigations into how these energy landscapes change during task performance, over normative neurodevelopment, throughout healthy aging, or in the context of psychiatric disease or neurological disorders. Moreover, they lay important theoretical groundwork in the critical development of probabilistic models of brain network dynamics subserving cognitive function.  A. Ashourvan et al.  Methods  Participants  Twenty participants (nine female; ages 19–53 years; mean age = 26.7 years) with normal or corrected vision and no history of neurological disease or psychiatric disorders were recruited for this experiment. All participants volunteered and provided informed consent in writing in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania (IRB #801929).  Human fMRI Data collection  Magnetic resonance images were obtained at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania using a 3.0 T Siemens Trio MRI scanner equipped with a 32-channel head coil. T1-weighted structural images of the whole brain were acquired on the ﬁrst scan session using a threedimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo pulse sequence (repetition time (TR) 1620 ms; echo time (TE) 3.09 ms; inversion time 950 ms; voxel size 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm; matrix size 190 × 263 × 165). A ﬁeld map was also acquired at each scan session (TR 1200 ms; TE1 4.06 ms; TE2 6.52 ms; ﬂip angle 60°; voxel size 3.4 mm × 3.4 mm × 4.0 mm; ﬁeld of view 220 mm; matrix size 64 × 64 × 52) to correct geometric distortion caused by magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneity. In all experimental runs with a behavioral task, T2*weighted images sensitive to blood oxygenation level-dependent contrasts were acquired using a slice accelerated multiband echo planar pulse sequence (TR 2000 ms; TE 25 ms; ﬂip angle 60°; voxel size 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm; ﬁeld of view 192 mm; matrix size 128 × 128 × 80). In all resting state runs, T2*-weighted images sensitive to blood oxygenation level-dependent contrasts were acquired using a slice accelerated multiband echo planar pulse sequence (TR 500 ms; TE 30 ms; ﬂip angle 30°; voxel size 3.0 mm × 3.0 mm × 3.0 mm; ﬁeld of view 192 mm; matrix size 64 × 64 × 48).  fMRI Preprocessing  We preprocessed the resting state fMRI data using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 6.00, part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library, http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl. Speciﬁcally, we applied: EPI distortion correction using FUGUE (Jenkinson, 2004); motion correction using MCFLIRT (Jenkinson et al., 2002); slice-timing correction using Fourier-space timeseries phase-shifting; non-brain removal using BET (Smith, 2002); grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor; highpass temporal ﬁltering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line ﬁtting, with sigma = 50.0 s).

Global signal was not regressed out of voxel time series (Murphy et al., 2009; Saad et al., 2012; Chai et al., 2012). Finally, the mean functional image and the 125-scale Lausanne parcellation template (Cammoun et al., 2012a) were coregistered using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, http:// www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm in order to extract ROIs' mean timeseries.  NeuroImage 157 (2017) 364–380  ICA-informed identiﬁcation of regions of interest  We used group-ICA (GIFT toolbox (Calhoun et al., 2001)) to identify ten large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICN) characteristic of the resting state. Computational considerations preclude us from studying a larger number of networks in the context of the maximum entropy model approach. Next, we identiﬁed the regions of interest (ROIs) by choosing the ROI from a commonly used anatomical atlas (the 125 scale Lausanne parcellation (Cammoun et al., 2012b)) in which we observed the maximum weighting of an ICA component. A list of identiﬁed ICNs and their corresponding Lausanne atlas ROI are provided in Table 1. InSupplementary Fig . SI5, we also discuss the eﬀect of anatomical versus functional parcellation methods on our results.  For computational reasons which we will discuss in more details shortly, we only included ROIs from the left hemisphere for the majority of components. The one exception to this rule was the right executive control network (RECN). Prior work has demonstrated that the putative fronto-parietal executive control network is identiﬁed as two bilateral ICNs (Shirer et al., 2012a; Laird et al., 2011), which separately play critical roles in executive function through their dynamical interactions with the DMN and attention systems (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014; Menon and Uddin, 2010). Thus we included time series from both the right and left executive control networks in all following analysis.  A note on statistics and computational considerations  The ﬁt of the maximum entropy model to small datasets can be subject to a sampling bias. More exactly, the estimation of the entropy suﬀers severely from downward bias (Treves and Panzeri, 1995) such that the estimated entropy from the observations is lower than the actual entropy of the underlying model (Macke et al., 2011). Ultimately the amount of data needed to accurately ﬁt the model is exponential to the number of ROIs. Therefore even a small number of ROIs (on the order of ten) requires access to extremely large datasets. This issue of computational complexity is especially critical for fMRI data where the slow sampling rate prohibits collection of individual subject data with a large number of observations. Consequently, in this manuscript we focus on group concatenated multiband data (with a quarter-second TR) and do not discuss In Supplementary Figure SI1, we brieﬂy discuss the model ﬁt at the subject- and group-level where we demonstrate that the goodness of ﬁt and accuracy of the model drops considerably when considering individual subjects as opposed to the group.  from individual  subjects.  results  The total number of partitions of an n-element set is the Bell number nBn (Grimaldi, 2006). In combinatorial mathematics, the Bell numbers count the number of partitions of a set. Thus the total number of possible community states of the 10 ROIs equals 115975. To accurately model this large number of states would require a large amount of data. However, local analysis (through the lens of a single ROI) of congruent community allegiance deals with a much smaller state space of 2 . At this level, it is computationally feasible to ﬁt a MEM with a relatively large multiband fMRI dataset such as the one we use here.  (=512)  N−1  It is worth noting that ICA assumes the BOLD data can be linearly decomposed into several spatially independent sources and the activation of each voxel is a mixture of all the ICA sources with varying contribution to each component. Therefore in order to ﬁnd an ROI within the component that is least diluted with other sources and represents the estimated ICA time series, we need to pick the ROI with the highest contribution to each component. In fact our complementary analysis (SI5) of the energy landscape of the ICA time series shows the close similarity between the results, which provides additional veriﬁcation that the chosen ROI correctly represents the estimated signal sources. Nevertheless as shown recently by Watanabe et al. (2013), the  374  A. Ashourvan et al.  NeuroImage 157 (2017) 364–380  resting state networks such as the DMN and executive control network also contain several basins of attractions of their own. Therefore we expect to see the reported landscape change if we choose ROIs other than the peak voxel, and these landscapes will be less representative of the average large-scale dynamics. To support this assumption, we have estimated the energy landscape of a randomly chosen set of ROIs from each ICA component. The results are presented in Fig. 11. B, where we observe that the energy landscape diﬀers from that characteristic of the ROIs most highly contributing to the independent component. Therefore, choosing ROIs other than the peak ROI will alter the results, either due to mixing of sources or due to the true internal state space dynamics. Our choice to use the ROI with the highest contribution to the component ensures that our results are most representative of the average state dynamics, but ﬁner-scale state dynamics could be explored by choosing ROIs that are not the highest contributors to the ICs.  Functional network construction  Following prior work (Bassett et al., 2011), we estimated the dynamic functional connectivity between all pairs of ROIs using wavelet coherence (WTC (Grinsted et al., 2004)). In Supplementary SI4 Fig. 1, we show that we observe two distinct bands of high WTC: 0.64–0.2 Hz and 0.19–0.06 Hz. In the main manuscript, we focus on the 0.19–0.06 Hz band due to known sensitivity to underlying neural activity, and we relegate discussion of the higher frequency band to the Supplement. WTC amplitudes were averaged over all frequencies within the selected band to construct the timecourse of the bandpassed WTC for each pair of ROIs resulting in a total of T (= 1190 (TRs) × 20 (subjects) × 4 (runs) = 95200) unique functional connectivity patterns, which we represent in N N× adjacency matrices A (see Fig. 8).  Community detection and module allegiance estimation  In the maximum entropy framework, it is critical that data points are as temporally distinct from one another as possible. In the context of our study, this requires that we reduce the dependence of community structure in the neighboring time slices. To do so, we identiﬁed the  community structure (Fortunato, 2010; Porter et al., 2009) of the each time slice adjacency matrix independently using a Louvain-like (Blondel et al., 2008) locally greedy heuristic algorithm to maximize the modularity quality function (Newman, 2006) with a structural resolution parameter of γ = 1 (Bassett et al., 2013a). The method partitions ROIs into communities based on the optimization of the following function: ∑Q 0 ij  γP δ g g j  A ij  =  −  [  ]  )  ij  (  ,  i  where A is a weighted adjacency matrix, ROI i and j are assigned respectively to community gi and gj, the Kronecker delta δ g g if j g g=i j (and zero otherwise), γ is the structural resolution parameter, and Pij is the expected weight of the edge between ROI i and j under some null model. We used the Newman-Girvan null model (Girvan and Newman, 2002)  ) = 1  (  ,  i  P ij  =  k k i j m 2  1 2  A ij  = ∑i j  = ∑ij  A ij is the strength of ROI i and m  where k . Brieﬂy, this method partitions the ROIs into groups such that the total connection strength within communities is more than expected in the null model. Importantly, the algorithm we use is a heuristic that implements a non-deterministic optimization (Good et al., 2010). Consequently we repeated the optimization 100 times (Bassett et al., 2013a), and we report results summarized over those iterations by forming a module allegiance matrix (Bassett et al., 2015; Mattar et al., 2015).  The allegiance matrix for each time slice represented the probability that ROI i and j were assigned to the same community over all iterations of the community detection algorithm (Fig. 9). For use in the maximum entropy model, we binarized the allegiance matrix by subtracting a random null model allegiance matrix from the original allegiance matrix: elements in the binarized allegiance matrix were 1 when the true allegiance was greater than the null, and 0 otherwise (Bassett et al., 2013a). The null allegiance matrices were generated by shuﬄing the ROI community assignments for each individual time point uniformly at random (Fig. 10).  Fig. 8. Schematic of Methods. (A) We used a group-ICA decomposition to distill fMRI resting state BOLD into N (=10) components representing putative baseline functional networks. For each ICN, we identiﬁed the voxel with the peak expression of that component. (B) Using the Lausanne 125 scale template (234 ROIs) (Cammoun et al., 2012b), we determined the atlas region corresponding to the peak expression of each component. After extracting BOLD time series from each ROI, we estimated the functional connectivity between pairs of ROIs using the wavelet coherence in the frequency interval 0.19–0.06 Hz (Bassett et al., 2011).  375  A.

(A) We represent the T (= 1190 (TRs) × 20 (subjects) × 4 (runs) = 95200) unique functional connectivity adjacency matrices A. (B) Using community detection, we extract putative functional modules at each TR, and use a statistical comparison to a random null model to patterns as N N× determine a region's binary module allegiance. More speciﬁcally, we identify the community organization of ROIs and calculate the probability of ROI pairs' congruent community allegiance for each time-point. The ROI pairs with higher than expected (via permutation tests) congruent community allegiance were thresholded to generate binarized pairwise allegiance matrices. (C) We reformat these data to separately store the allegiance time series of each ROI, which codes its co-allegiance with other ROIs to the same community (values of 1) as a function of time (TR).  Maximum entropy model ﬁtting  Here we hypothesize that the brain transitions between diﬀerent functional community states. To obtain an unbiased estimate of these states and their probabilities, we ﬁt a pair-wise maximum entropy model. The principle of maximum entropy states that when estimating the probability distribution, given the constraints, one should ﬁnd the distribution that maximizes the uncertainty (i.e., entropy). Choosing any other distribution that lowers the entropy would assume information that we do not possess; therefore the only reasonable distribution is the maximum entropy distribution. Fitting the MEM entails tuning the ﬁrst and second-order interaction parameter between regions so that the predicted activation rates and co-activation rates match that of the empirically observed values. An accurate pair-wise MEM ﬁt suggests that the observed dynamics of the communities can be simply explained as a combination of each region's independent activation rate plus the regions' joint activation rates. In other words, the MEM allows us to establish a model of brain functional dynamics as a probabilistic process shaped by intrinsic relationships between brain regions .  We ﬁt the pairwise MEM to the binarized community allegiance of ROI pairs. To reduce the size of the state space and therefore ensure less error in our estimates, we ﬁt the MEM to each row of the allegiance matrix independently for each ROI, eﬀectively reducing the dimen t  , …,,  t σ N  t t σ σ 2 1  ,  ,…,  ] , where σj  the congruent t σ = [ , i −1  sionality to N-1 (= 9) and reducing the total number of possible congruent community membership states to 2 = 512 . For ROI i at time community membership state is deﬁned as t t V σ t is the binarized community i +1 allegiance of i and j at time point t (‘1′ for congruent community membership and ‘0′ otherwise), and N is the total number of ROIs (= 10). Because it is not possible to directly compare the local community allegiance states due to the unmatched cardinality of the set of ROIs, we assume that the ROI being examined will always have an allegiance state of one. For ROI i the empirical congruent community membership rate of ROI j, σj , is given by , where T is the number of time slices, which in this case is equal to the number of TRs. Likewise the empirical pairwise congruent community membership rate of ROIs j and l, σ σ,j  l , is deﬁned as  Here our only constraints were that the model σj m and σ σj  l m matched the empirical values of σj and σ σj l respectively.

We therefore combined data across all subjects before ﬁtting a pairwise MEM to each ROI's pattern of allegiance to functional modules. This ﬁtting procedure produced an estimated interaction matrix for each ROI and each TR; colors indicate the strength of each element of the interaction matrix Jij. (B) From the interaction matrices, we deﬁned and characterized energy landscapes of the local community dynamics. Color indicates energy, with yellow indicating high energy and dark blue indicating low energy.

Nevertheless, higherorder and/or nonlinear interactions likely contribute to smaller yet non-negligible portions of the observed brain dynamics.  It is important to note that in our presented framework, the concept of energy is not a literal one, but is rather metaphorical. Indeed, we cannot yet claim that the calculations are related to biological notions of energy (e.g., ATP) or physical notions of energy (e.g., an exact Hamiltonian for BOLD ﬂuctuations). Instead, we use the term because it is the technical term associated with the landscapes that can be extracted from a maximum entropy model, and is therefore a relevant function based on the region's community allegiance that allows us to capture the observed spatial correlation patterns. It should be treated  Fig. 11. Energy landscape of random ROIs time series. (A) Here we show (Left) the local minima, (Middle) the basin size of local minima states as the fraction of the number of basin states to the number of total possible states, and (Right) the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between any two ROIs' vectors of basin size across minima states of the original time series. (B) Similar results are presented for the time series extracted from a random set of ROIs from ICA components.  377  A. Ashourvan et al.  simply as a useful mathematical quantity.  Deﬁning an energy landscape  The energy landscape for each ROI is deﬁned separately by the network of congruent community membership states Vk and their corresponding energy values E V( )k . In this landscape the adjacent states' vectors are only one hamming distance apart, which means that all ROIs except one have the same binary values as in adjacent states' vectors. (Watanabe et al., 2014a).  9  (=2 = 512)  An interesting question to ask of this landscape is the location and nature of energy minima. To address this question, we exhaustively searched the entire landscape using a steep search algorithm to ﬁnd the states with energies lower than all their neighboring states (i.e. local minima). Next in order to identify the states that belong to the basin of each local minima we ﬁrst start at a given state Vk (one of the 2 N−1 possible states) and iteratively move to the neighboring state Vw in the landscape if E V ) ( k . We continue tracing out this w path until we reach a local minima state where no neighboring states exist with smaller energy values (similar to (Watanabe et al., 2014c, 2013)). We consider this ﬁnal state Vk the basin state of the local minima. We also deﬁne the basin size of that local minima state as the fraction of the number of basin states to the total number of possible states.  E V ) < (  k  S  k  ,  ,  (  ) − (  E V E V V w  of minima E V ) − ( ( k  We were next interested in understanding the predicted barriers between states. We estimated the energy barrier opposing the transition between all the local minima states in the following way. (1) We removed the state (node) with the highest energy from the energy landscape along with the edges connecting that state to its neighbors. (2) We assessed whether each pair of local minima were connected by a path in the reduced landscape. We repeated steps (1) and (2) until we found the saddle state where removing the highest energy node disconnects one or more local minima from the rest of the landscape. We continued this process until we obtained a reduced landscape where all of the local minima are isolated and we identiﬁed all saddle states. (3) We calculated the symmetric energy barrier (Zhou, 2011) between all pairs the minimum of E V V ), [ ) S w is the energy k w of the saddle point between minima states Vk, Vw and E V( )k and E V( )w are the energies at these states, respectively. If the energy barrier between to minima states was high then the model predicts that the rate of transition between them is low, at least in one direction (Watanabe et al., 2013). We also calculated the asymmetric energy barrier between minima states Vk, Vw as E V V E V ) − ( ) , k and E V(S k, w k V→k E V V ) − ( w and the latter the w V→w V k energy barriers. Overall, our results did not show any relationship between estimated energy barriers (symmetric and asymmetric) between local minima states and the empirical basin transition probabilities and frequencies. We speculate that the energy barrier mimics the basin transition probabilities only when the basins are smooth and funnel-like. We speculate that other unaccounted factors such as the shape of the basins may contribute more to the observed basin transition probabilities than the energy barriers between the basins.  ( k , where the former indicated the V )  states w , where E V V )]  as  (  S  ,  S  Simulation of state transitions  To better understand the dynamic patterns of functional communities at rest, we simulated these dynamics as a random walk process over the estimated local energy landscapes using a Markov chain Monte Carlo with Metropolis-Hastings (MCMC) algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hastings, 1970; Zhou, 2011). In this model, local community allegiance state Vi is allowed an isometric transition to one of N − 1 neighboring state with uniform probability.

Next, we removed the initial steps to ensure independence of results from the initial conditions and decreased the sampling rate by 500 to reduce the correlation between the samples. Since each state in the energy landscape belongs to the basin of a single local minima, we can construct a trajectory of local minima states' basin transitions from the down-sampled state transitions patterns. Comparing the empirical and simulated basin transition probability and frequency patterns allows us to evaluate the resemblance of the proposed random walk model's dynamics to that of the brain.

Gaze direction is an important modiﬁer of the social signals conveyed by an emotion, for example, an angry face looking directly at you is considerably more threatening than an angry face looking away. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that older adults would show less neural differentiation to angry faces with direct and avert gaze compared to younger people, with the opposite prediction for happy faces. Healthy older (65e75 years; mean ¼ 69.75) and younger (17e27 years; mean ¼ 20.65) adults completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which they were asked to identify happy and angry expressions displayed either with direct or averted gaze. While younger adults showed neural sensitivity to eye-gaze direction during recognition of angry expressions, older adults showed no effect of eye-gaze direction on neural response. In contrast, older adults showed sensitivity to eye-gaze direction during recognition of happy expressions but younger adults did not. Additionally, brain-behavior correlations were conducted to investigate the relationships between emotion recognition and mentalizing brain network in both age groups. Younger (but not older) adults’ social cognitive performance was differentially correlated with activation in 2 brain networks when looking at angry faces with direct compared to averted gaze. These novel ﬁndings provide evidence for age-related differences in the neural substrates underlying the capacity to integrate facial affect and eye-gaze cues. The results of this study suggest that age-related differences in integrating facial cues may be related to engagement of the mentalizing network, with potentially important implications for social cognitive functioning in late adulthood.

For example, the personal signiﬁcance of an angry expression depends on whether it is accompanied by direct or averted gaze. Aging diminishes the ability to process information from eye gaze  * Corresponding author at: Centre for Advanced Imaging, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.

Reduced sensitivity to expression and eye-gaze cues may be indicative of underlying structural and functional neural changes in old age and may have potential consequences for social interaction in late adulthood. Emotion recognition constitutes a critical skill in effective social communication particularly for maintaining positive interaction and interpersonal relationships. Thus, any difﬁculties recognizing emotional expressions and facial cues have the potential to negatively impact a person’s capacity to develop and maintain strong social networks, with attendant consequences for health and wellbeing. Reduced sensitivity to emotional expressions and eye-gaze  M. Ziaei et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 48 (2016) 182e194  183  cues may be indicative of age-related changes in the underlying neural correlates involved in social cognitive processing.  There is now evidence that social cognitive processing imposes demands on a large number of different brain regions and their connectivity (see e.g., Molenberghs et al., 2016). However, it remains important to gain a more complete and nuanced understanding of the functional networks that subserve these processes, as well as how these networks change in the context of normal adult aging. This is because social cognitive difﬁculties are early and salient features of many clinical disorders, including many common neurodegenerative disorders associated with old age (Bora et al., 2016; Henry et al., 2016; Kemp et al., 2012; McCade et al., 2011). A better understanding of the neural networks that subserve core aspects of change in social cognitive function in late adulthood could inform differential diagnosis and treatment of social cognitive impairment in this age group.  A number of neuroimaging studies have assessed age-related differences in processing emotional facial expressions (e.g., for a review see Ziaei and Fischer, 2016). While some studies found agerelated decline in neural response to negative facial emotions, including regions of the medial temporal lobe such as the amygdala (Iidaka et al., 2002) and anterior ventral insula cortex (Fischer et al., 2005), other studies reported that younger and older adults recruited different brain regions irrespective of emotional valence (Gunning-Dixon et al., 2003). Direct comparisons between happy and angry expressions revealed 2 main ﬁndings (Ebner et al., 2012). First, greater ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity was seen during recognition of happy (relative to angry) faces across both age groups. Second, greater dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) activity in response to angry (relative to happy) faces was more pronounced for older relative to younger adults. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that older and younger adults differ in the neural networks they recruit when processing emotional expressions, and that for older adults, more cognitive effort may be required to recognize angry (relative to happy) facial expressions. However, whether there are also age differences in the brain networks involved in processing and integrating communicative facial cues (i.e., directed and averted gaze), and in interaction with facial expressions, remains to be established. It also remains unclear whether agerelated neural differences in processing facial affective cues are related to social cognitive functioning, such as theory of mind (TOM) and social behavior. To our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst to examine the age-related changes in the neural networks involved in processing facial communicative cues and their implications for social cognitive performance.  Angry expressions in the context of direct gaze signal immediate threat to the observer. Neural responses to such threatening cues are automatic (Shepherd, 2010) and reﬂexive (Adams et al., 2012). In contrast, angry expressions accompanied by averted gaze signal that the anger is directed toward something else in the environment, thus, less likely to be interpreted as personal threat and may invoke higher-order social cognitive brain regions to determine the intentions of the angry individual (Pfeiffer et al., 2013). However, because older adults show a lack of sensitivity to eye gaze in angry expressions (Slessor et al., 2010), they may also show more similar neural patterns when observing angry faces with direct and averted gaze. Additionally, age-related changes in integrating facial cues may reﬂect a lack of recruitment of mentalizing networks when processing social information. Recruitment of these networks may be most critical when understanding of the mental state of others is required, such as when processing angry faces with averted gaze. Although happy expressions presented with direct versus averted eye-gaze orientations might convey different meanings, being targeted with happiness is less critical for survival than being targeted with anger. It, therefore, is possible that, at a neural level,  there is less differentiation in the brain regions activated for direct versus averted gaze in happy expressions relative to angry expressions, especially among younger adults. In contrast, given the evidence that older adults are particularly motivated to attend to and process positive information such as happy faces (Carstensen, 2006; Mather and Carstensen, 2003) compared to their younger counterparts, older adults may show greater neural differentiation when processing happy expressions with different eye-gaze directions which has not been addressed in prior literature.  To ﬁll this research gap, the aim of this study was to identify age differences in the neural substrates involved in processing happy and angry facial expressions with different eye-gaze cues. We predicted that in younger adults, distinct brain substrates would be activated in response to angry expressions with differing gaze cues. For angry faces with direct gaze, activity in the salience network, involved in identifying the most relevant stimuli in the environment and orienting attention toward them in order to adaptively guide behavior (Barrett and Satpute, 2013; Menon, 2015) should be more prominent. On the other hand, in averted gaze conditions, additional brain networks involved in mentalizing, including regions such as edial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) (Frith and Frith, 2006; Roy et al., 2012; Van Overwalle, 2009; Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009), should be engaged in decoding intentions. This study is the ﬁrst to test this prediction and will therefore provide novel insights on how brain networks involved in processing facial features changing in the context of healthy aging. Because older adults showed less distinction between angry direct and averted eye-gaze cues, we hypothesized attenuated neural differentiation between these conditions in older adults.  Consistent with socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen et al., 2003), we expected that older adults might show greater differentiation in processing facial expressions of happiness because of their high motivation to attend to positive stimuli. However, the neural differentiation between direct and averted gaze should be smaller for happy than for angry expressions in younger adults. We expected to observe increased activity in the reward brain network, such as vmPFC (Kringelbach and Rolls, 2004; O’Doherty et al., 2001; Roy et al., 2012), during recognition of happy expressions.  including regions  2. Material and methods  2.1. Participants  Twenty-one healthy older adults (aged 65e75 years; mean [M] ¼ 69.75, standard deviation [SD] ¼ 2.97; 10 females) and 21 healthy younger adults (aged 17e27 years; M ¼ 20.65, SD ¼ 2.66; 10 females) participated in this study. One older and one younger adults were excluded from the analysis due to brain signal loss, leaving 20 participants in each group. Younger adults were undergraduate students at the University of Queensland who were reimbursed with either course credits or $15 Australian dollar (AUD) per hour. The older adults were community volunteers who were reimbursed with $20 AUD per hour. Older adults were recruited through advertising in public notice boards of different clubs, libraries, churches, and the University of Queensland’s Aging Mind Initiative. All participants were right-handed English speakers who had normal or corrected-to-normal vision using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible glasses and no history of neurological impairment, psychiatric illnesses, head or heart surgery, or cardiovascular disease. Participants were screened for MRI compatibility as well as claustrophobia, neurological, and psychiatric medication including mood disorder and epilepsy before taking part in this study. Participants took part in 2 separate sessions of testing, the ﬁrst involving functional MRI (fMRI)  184  M. Ziaei et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 48 (2016) 182e194  scanning and the second involving behavioral/neuropsychological assessment. The 2 sessions were conducted 3e4 days apart from each other. All participants were provided with written consent forms approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Queensland and were debriefed upon the completion of the second session.  2.2. Task materials  Angry, happy, and neutral faces (100 for each expression) were drawn from the FACES database (Ebner et al., 2010). Neutral faces were used as control to remove the effects of the visual perception component. All faces were colored, front view, and high quality (300 dots per inch). The presented faces comprised 2 age groups (young posers: 18e31 years and old posers: 69e80 years). The gazes of the posers were photoshopped so that an equal number of direct and averted gazes were used for the scanner task. All faces were categorized into 5 lists, using MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, MA, USA), according to 4 selection criteria: age of the posers, gender of the posers, gaze direction, and emotional expression. The lists consisted of equal number of male and female posers (30 each), old and young posers (30 each), and emotional expressions (20 for each expression) and were presented in each fMRI run for a total of 5 runs. The order of the runs presented in the scanner was counterbalanced among participants. To control facial attractiveness on recognition of emotional expressions, faces in each list were also matched based on their attractiveness ratings from an independent study (M ¼ 41.66, SD ¼ 13.08; Ebner and Johnson, 2010). All the stimuli were presented against a gray background using E-prime software, adjusted to be standardized in size (600  450 pixels) prior to presentation in the MRI scanner.  for effects of  2.3. Experimental design  In the scanner, participants performed 2 runs of the emotion recognition task (described in the following section), followed by a structural MRI acquisition, followed by another 3 runs of the emotion recognition task. During the emotion recognition task (Fig. 1), each face was presented one at a time for 3.5 seconds, followed by a ﬁxation cross. Presentation of the ﬁxation cross was jittered using 3 time intervals: 0.5 seconds,1 second, and 1.5 seconds in order to allow for an independent estimation of the bloodoxygen-level dependent response on a trial-by-trial basis. Furthermore, using jittered intertrial intervals can enhance statistical power in the analyses (Huettel et al., 2014). Each of the 5 task runs lasted for 4.5 minutes. Participants were required to indicate, as fast and as accurately as possible, whether each face displayed a happy, angry, or a neutral emotional expression by pressing the relevant button on an MRI-compatible response boxdusing index ﬁnger for either angry or happy, the middle ﬁnger for neutral, and the ring ﬁnger for either happy or angry (counterbalanced across participants).  2.4. Neuropsychological measures  During the behavioral sessions, all participants were asked to complete a range of background measures assessing executive control, intelligence, emotion recognition, social functioning, personality, empathy, and TOM ability. Descriptive and inferential statistics of background measures are reported in Table 1. Descriptions of the measures are as follow:  2.4.1. National Adult Reading Test  The National Adult Reading Test (Nelson, 1982) is a valid and reliable measure of crystallized intelligence that consists of 50 irregular words. Participants were required to read each word aloud, and their responses were scored by 2 independent coders. Interrater reliability was reported 0.88 (Crawford et al., 1989).  The 50-minute scanner session consisted of 2 components: structural MRI and fMRI. Prior to the scanning, participants were provided with verbal and visual instructions about the emotion recognition task and subsequently asked to practice it until they were completely familiarized with the instructions and timing of the task. The reason for training participants prior to the fMRI task was to ensure that the behavioral performance of accurately detecting the faces for both groups was equated, so that any differences at the neural level could not simply be attributed to differences in performance. Faces used in the practice run were different to those used during the main task in the scanner.  2.4.2. Trail Making Test  The Trail Making Test consists of 2 parts, A and B (Reitan and Wolfson, 1986). In part A, participants were instructed to connect the circled numbers in sequential orders. In part B, they were instructed to alternate between numbers and letters (e.g., 1-A-2-B). This measure provides an index of executive control. Part A predominantly measures visuoperceptual abilities, whereas part B additionally indexes working memory and mental ﬂexibility. In order to minimize visuoperceptual demands, we used the B-A index to provide a relatively pure indicator of executive control abilities (Sanchez-Cubillo et al., 2009).  Fig. 1. Example of experimental design. Each trial consisted of a presentation of a face with happy, angry, or neutral expressions for 3.5 seconds. Equal numbers of male and female faces with direct and averted gaze were presented. Fixation crosses were jittered using 0.5 seconds, 1 second, and 1.5 seconds time intervals. In total, the task consisted of 5 runs, 4.5 minutes each. During the task, participants were required to indicate the emotional expressions of each face by using an MRI-compatible response buttons.

Ekman Emotion Recognition Test  The faces used in this experiment were drawn from the “Facial Expressions of Emotion: Stimuli and Test” stimuli set (Young et al., 2002). Sixty black and white images from 6 basic emotional categories: anger, sadness, surprise, happiness, disgust, and fear, were presented for 3.5 seconds. Participants were asked to choose the best label that describes each face and press the respective key on the keyboard. Reaction times and responses were recorded.  2.4.4. Peer-Report Social Functioning Scale  This scale is a peer-report assessment of social functioning (Henry et al., 2009). A 10-item subscale assesses socially inappropriate behavior (a ¼ 0.87; e.g., “enquires about potentially embarrassing issues in public” or “comments negatively on someone else’s physical appearance”). A 17-item subscale assesses socially appropriate behavior (a ¼ 0.92; e.g., “speaks positively about others” or “lets other people have their say”). A 3-item subscale assesses prejudicial and stereotyping behavior (a ¼ 0.75; e.g., “ignores stereotypes when making decision about people”). Participants’ peers provided their responses on a 4-point scale with labels, never, rarely, occasionally, frequently. Higher scores indicate a higher level of socially inappropriate behavior, socially appropriate behavior, or prejudicial behavior on the 3 subscales. Internal consistency reliability was reported high (a ¼ 0.94) (Henry et al., 2009).  2.4.5. Big Five Personality Inventory  A 44-item self-report personality inventory was used (John et al., 1991). This test comprises of 5 subscales measuring 5 personality dimensions, including Extraversion (a ¼ 0.88; 8 items; e.g., “I am someone who is talkative”), Agreeableness (a ¼ 0.79; 9 items; e.g., “I am someone who is helpful and unselﬁsh with others”), Conscientiousness (a ¼ 0.82; 9 items; e.g., “I am someone who does a thorough job”), Neuroticism (a ¼ 0.84; 8 items; e.g., “I am someone who is depressed, blue”), and Openness (a ¼ 0.81; 10  items; e.g., “I am someone who is original, comes up with new ideas”). Participants provided their responses on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) for each item to indicate the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with each statement. The reliability of this test has been estimated to be 0.83 (John and Srivastava, 1999).  2.4.6. Empathy quotient  A 40-item adult version of the empathy quotient developed by Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright (2004) was used in this study. Participants responded to this questionnaire by choosing 1 of the 4scale response options; strongly agree, slightly agree, slightly disagree, and strongly disagree. On each item, a person can obtain 2, 1, or 0, so the empathy quotient score has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum of 0. High test-retest reliability (a ¼ 0.83) was reported (Lawrence et al., 2004).  2.4.7. Reading the Mind in the Eye Test  This is a measure of TOM, which broadly refers to the ability to understand the mental states of others (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001). This test consists of a series of 36 photographs of the eye region of a person’s face. Participants are required to choose which word (out of words) best describes what the person in the picture is feeling or thinking. The Reading the Mind in the Eye Test (RMET) assesses how well people can decode others’ mental states and is one of the best-validated measures of TOM (Henry et al., 2013).  2.5.  Image acquisition and analysis  Functional images were acquired using a 3T Siemens scanner equipped with a 32-channel head coil. The acquisition of functional data was achieved by using a whole-brain T2*-weighted echoplanar image sequence (93 interleaved slices, repetition time [TR] ¼ 3000 ms, echo time ¼ 45 ms, ﬂip angle ¼ 90, ﬁeld of  186 view ¼ 192 mm, voxel size ¼ 2 mm3). High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired with an magnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (126 slice with 1-mm thickness, TR ¼ 1900 ms, echo time ¼ 2.3 ms, inversion time ¼ 900 ms, ﬁeld of view ¼ 230 ms, voxel size ¼ 0.9 mm3, ﬂip angle ¼ 90). The tasks were presented to participants on a computer screen through a mirror mounted on top of the head coil. Participants were using earplugs and cushions inside the head coil to dampen the noise and minimize the head movement.  For functional analysis, images were preprocessed with Statistical Parametric Mapping Software (SPM8; http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl. ac.uk/spm) implemented in MATLAB 2010b. Following the realignment to a mean image for head-motion correction, the images were segmented to gray matter and white matter and then spatially normalized into a standard stereotaxic space with a voxel size of 2 mm3 using the Montreal Neurological Institute template and ﬁnally spatially smoothed with a 6-mm Gaussian Kernel. Data were examined for artifacts, such as ghosting in the initial stages, and individual time series were checked for motion artifact. Trials with more than 1-mm movement were excluded from analyses.  The imaging data were analyzed using a multivariate analytical technique partial least square (PLS) analysis (McIntosh et al., 1996, 2004; for a detailed tutorial and review of PLS, see Krishnan et al., 2011), as implemented in PLS software running on MATLAB 2010b. PLS decomposes all images into a set of patterns that capture the greatest amount of covariance in the data, rather than making assumptions about conditions or imposing contrasts for each pattern. PLS analysis uses singular value decomposition of a single matrix that contains all participants’ data to ﬁnd a set of orthogonal latent variables (LVs), which represent linear combinations of the original variables. Therefore, PLS enables one to differentiate the degree of contribution of different brain regions associated with task demands, behavioral or anatomical covariates, or functional seed activity.  The ﬁrst LV usually accounts for the largest covariance of the data, with progressively smaller amount of covariance for subsequent LVs. Each LV delineates cohesive patterns of brain activity related to experimental conditions. Additionally, brain scores are calculated as the dot product of a participant’s image volume of each LV. The brain score reﬂects how strongly each participant contributes to the pattern expressed in each LV. Therefore, each LV consists of a singular image of voxel saliences (i.e., a spatiotemporal pattern of brain activity), a singular proﬁle of task saliences (i.e., a set of weights that indicate how brain activity in the singular image is related to the experimental conditions, functional seeds, or behavioral/anatomical covariates), and a singular value (i.e., the amount of covariance accounted for by the LV). Given that the task was event related, the analysis was conducted on the 15-second period (5 TRs), starting at the onset of each face to account for the duration of the blood-oxygen-level dependent response. Activity at each time point in the analysis was normalized to activity in the ﬁrst TR. As the activation patterns identiﬁed by PLS and corresponding brain responses are done in a single mathematical step, there is no need for multiple comparison correction (McIntosh et al., 2004).  The statistical signiﬁcance of each LV was assessed using a permutation test, which determines the probability of a singular value from 500 random reordering and resampling (McIntosh et al., 1996). In addition to the permutation test, to determine the reliability of the saliences for each brain voxel, a standard error of each voxel’s salience on each LV was estimated by 100 bootstrap resampling steps (Efron and Tibshirani, 1985). Peak voxels with a bootstrap ratio (i.e., salience/standard error) > 3.0 were considered to be reliable, as this approximates p < 0.01 (Sampson et al., 1989). In the present study, we used task PLS and brain-behavior PLS, to  M. Ziaei et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 48 (2016) 182e194  examine the whole-brain activity pattern for processing each emotional category as a function of eye gaze and to assess the link between performance in the emotion recognition task and TOM ability.  The procedure of the fMRI analysis was 2-fold. First, our main aim was to examine the impact of age on whole-brain activity during the labeling of emotional faces presented with different eyegaze direction. We conducted whole-brain analyses of brain activity during angry and happy conditions, which were compared between the 2 age groups. Neutral faces were included in the experimental design as a control condition to remove the effects of the visual perception component (for a review see Sabatinelli et al., 2011). However, the ambiguity of neutral faces may lead to uncertainty and heightened vigilance, which in turn may increase amygdala activation (Blasi et al., 2009) and may be evaluated as more negative in some situations (Lee et al., 2008). Therefore, all analyses were conducted only on happy and angry facial expressions in order to avoid activation confounds due to the presence of neutral pictures. In order to demonstrate the robustness of brain responses to happy and angry expressions, additional analyses including neutral conditions were also conducted. The results are reported in the Supplementary Fig. 1. Overall, the brain pattern responses to happy and angry expressions did not change as a result of including neutral expressions in the whole-brain analyses. For the wholebrain analyses, all voxel activities for both age groups were included in the analyses for the 4 experimental conditions; angry direct, angry averted, happy direct, and happy averted. However, for simpliﬁcation and greater visual clarity, conditions are illustrated separately in Figs. 3 and 4.  Second, given that our ability to understand and respond to emotional cues in the environment is an integral part of our social cognitive ability, we examined the relationship between the recognition of facial cues and TOM performance. To explore any age-related differences in integrating facial cues in relation to social cognitive abilities, we conducted a brain-behavior analysis, examining the relationship between the neural activation involved in gaze and emotion processes and the TOM performance, the scores obtained on the RMET. For angry expressions, we included the accuracy of behavioral performance in the scanner task and correlated them with TOM scores. Because accuracy for recognition of happy expressions was at ceiling for both age groups, TOM scores were correlated with the brain activity in the 2 happy experimental conditions without including the behavioral performance accuracy from the emotion recognition task. For the brain-behavior analyses, all voxel activities for both age groups, accuracy from the emotion recognition task, and behavioral scores from the TOM task were included in the analyses for the 2 angry conditions (Fig. 5). For simpliﬁcation, however, we depicted the age groups in separate ﬁgures (Fig. 6). For happy expressions, all voxel activities for both age groups as well as scores from the TOM task were included in the analyses. These results are illustrated in Fig. 6.  Reaction times and accuracies during the emotion recognition task were subjected to mixed-model analyses of variance with age group as the between-subjects factor and emotional expression and eye-gaze orientation as the within-subjects factors.  3. Results  The descriptive and inferential statistics of all background measures were reported in Table 1. Older adults scored above the recommended cutoff of 27 on a widely-used dementia screen (M ¼ 28.38, SD ¼ 1.28), the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al., 1975). Signiﬁcant difference between both age groups in the TOM scores measured by RMET was also found as reported in Table 1.  M. Ziaei et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 48 (2016) 182e194  187  Fig. 2. Behavioral results from emotion recognition task. Recognition of happy expressions was faster and more accurate relative to angry expressions for both age groups. However, there were no signiﬁcant differences between avert or direct gaze in accuracy rates and response times in either of the age groups.  3.1. Emotion identiﬁcation performance  A 2 (gaze direction: direct, averted) by 2 (emotional expression: angry, happy) by 2 (age group: young, older) repeated-measures analysis of variance with response accuracy as the dependent measure showed that there was a signiﬁcant main effect of emotional expression, F(1, 38) ¼ 34.85, p < 0.01, hp 2 ¼ 0.47. This reﬂected greater accuracy in recognizing happy relative to angry facial expressions in both age groups (Fig. 2 and Table 1). No other main effects or interactions were signiﬁcant (all Fs <1). A similar analysis on response times of accurate responses revealed a main effect of emotional expressions, F(1,37) ¼ 87.68, p < 2 ¼ 0.70, with faster responses for happy relative to angry 0.01, hp facial expressions (Fig. 2 and Table 1). None of the other main or interaction effects were signiﬁcant (all Fs <1).  3.2. Whole-brain analyses  The whole-brain responses for angry and happy expressions for both age groups are reported in this section. First, the ﬁndings for  angry expressions and then happy expressions ﬁndings for both age groups will be presented.  3.2.1. Angry expressions  The results from the whole-brain analyses showed 2 signiﬁcant and distinct LVs for recognition of angry expressions as a function of eye gaze among younger but not older adults. The ﬁrst LV accounted for 33% of the covariance in the data and included brain regions such as inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and amygdala. This pattern of brain activation in young adults was found only for angry expressions with averted gaze. In contrast, older adults recruited these regions during recognition of angry expressions with both direct and averted gaze (Fig. 3A and Table 2). LV2, which accounted for 25% of the covariance in the data, yielded a pattern that was related to the recognition of angry expressions with direct gaze only among younger adults. This pattern included insula and medial prefrontal gyrus, the main nodes of the salience network (Menon, 2015). In older adults, there was no reliable recruitment of these regions in any of the conditions (Fig. 3B and  Fig. 3. Whole-brain results for angry expressions.

Table 2). These results indicate that social cognitive brain regions, such as mPFC, IPL, STS, and amygdala (Frith and Frith, 2006; Van Overwalle, 2009), were engaged among younger adults during recognition of expressions in which the understanding of the intention of expresser was required, that is angry expressions with averted gaze. The salience network, including insula, medial prefrontal gyrus, in contrast, was activated in young participants when recognizing angry expressions with possible threatening signals to the self, that is, direct gaze. These data further demonstrate that at the neural level, younger, but not older adults, are differentiating between angry facial expressions with direct versus averted gaze.  3.2.2. Happy expressions  During the recognition of happy expressions, results from the whole-brain analyses revealed 2 LVs. The ﬁrst LV included brain regions such as ACC, PCC, precuneus, angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and hippocampusdknown as major nodes of the default mode network (DMN; Buckner et al., 2008; Raichle et al., 2001). These brain regions were engaged by older adults for happy facial expressions with direct gaze. In contrast, younger adults recruited these regions for happy expressions with both direct and averted gaze (Fig. 4A and Table 3). LV2 yielded a network of brain regions including medial and middle PFC, ACC, MTG, superior temporal gyrus (STG), PCC, and precuneus. These regions were engaged by older adults for happy expression with averted gaze and by younger adults for both direct and averted gaze (Fig. 4B and Table 3). Overall, the whole-brain analyses for happy expressions indicate that older, but not younger adults, recruit 2 orthogonal networks during recognition of happy expressions as a function of  eye gaze while younger adults showed no sensitivity in their neural activity patterns to the eye-gaze orientations in happy faces.  To summarize the results so far: younger adults showed the predicted differential brain activation to angry faces with direct and averted gaze, while older adults showed no such differentiation. In contrast, older adults were sensitive to gaze direction when processing happy faces, while younger adults were not.  3.3. Brain-behavior analyses  Lack of sensitivity to eye-gaze cues during recognition of angry expressions might have consequences for social cognitive abilities. Thus, if the capacity to integrate facial cues declines in late adulthood, such age-related changes might be related to the differential engagement of mentalizing or social cognitive brain regions. Brainbehavior analyses were conducted to assess the correlation between brain activity during the angry and happy recognition conditions with TOM scores obtained on the RMET (administered outside the scanner).  3.3.1. Angry expressions  Accuracy scores from the angry conditions in the emotion recognition task were included in the brain-behavior analysis with the scores from the TOM task for both age groups in one single analysis. Brain-behavior analyses focused on angry expressions revealed 1 signiﬁcant LV, which accounted for 36% of the covariance in the data and yielded 2 patterns of brain activity. The ﬁrst of these patterns included superior, middle, and inferior PFC regions as well as insula. This network subserved recognition of angry expressions with averted gaze among younger adults and correlated positively with TOM scores and accuracy during the recognition of angry averted gazes. That is, those younger adults who performed better on the TOM task and the recognition of angry averted gazes engaged the frontal brain regions to a larger extent than those young adults with poorer performance (Fig. 5A and Table 4). The second brain pattern mainly included posterior brain regions such as PCC, precuneus, cuneus, middle occipital gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, MTG as well as mPFC and caudate. This network subserved the recognition of angry expressions with direct gaze among younger adults and was correlated positively with TOM scores and accuracy during recognition of angry faces with direct gaze. In other words, younger adults who obtained higher scores on the TOM task and were better at recognizing angry faces with direct gaze recruited a set of posterior brain regions when processing angry direct gaze faces than those younger adults with poorer performance (Fig. 5A and Table 4).  In older adults group, brain-behavior analyses revealed 2 important ﬁndings. First, activity of the posterior brain regions (i.e., PCC, precuneus, cuneus, middle occipital gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, MTG as well as medial PFC and caudate) was correlated with TOM scores during recognition of angry expressions, irrespective of eye-gaze directions. Moreover, these regions were only correlated with TOM scores and not with accuracy of recognizing angry faces. In other words, there were no reliable associations between TOM scores and task performance in the scanner among older adults. Older adults who obtained higher scores on the TOM task engaged only the posterior areas while recognizing angry expressions with both direct and averted eye-gaze orientation. However, activity in these regions was not related to older adults’ behavioral performance in the recognition of angry expressions in the scanner (Fig. 5B and Table 4).  3.3.2. Happy expressions  For the happy conditions, accuracy scores were at ceiling, thus, only the correlations between TOM scores and brain activation  M.

The corresponding analyses for happy expressions revealed one signiﬁcant LV. This LV accounted for 32% of the covariance in the data and yielded a set of regions that were activated during the recognition of happy averted gaze among older adults and positively correlated with TOM scores. This network included superior, middle, and inferior PFC, ACC, STG, IPL, and precuneus regions. Older adults who obtained higher scores on the TOM task recruited these brain areas when they were recognizing happy expressions displayed with averted gaze more than with direct gaze and more than younger adults (Fig. 6 and Table 5).

Discussion  The present results provide novel insights into the neural substrates underlying age-related differences in integrating facial affect and eye-gaze cues. First, the whole-brain results showed that, in contrast to younger adults, older adults’ brain activity was not modulated by eye-gaze direction during the recognition of angry expressions. Second, the brain-behavior results showed that the ability to integrate angry expression and gaze cues was related to TOM ability, for younger, but not older adults. TOM ability was differentially correlated with 2 distinct networks of brain regions activated as a function of eye-gaze direction in the presence of an angry expression. The brain-behavior correlations indicated that older adults’ lack of neural sensitivity to eye gaze with angry expressions was related to decreased recruitment of the main nodes of the mentalizing network, such as mPFC, STS, and amygdala (Frith and Frith, 2006; Molenberghs et al., 2016; Van Overwalle, 2009) in situations in which interpreting the intentions of the expresser is important; angry expressions with averted gaze.  In keeping with previous research indicating that older adults are more motivated to process positive facial expressions, older, but not younger, adults’ brain activity was modulated by eye-gaze direction during the recognition of happy expressions by recruiting the major nodes of the DMN, such as vmPFC, PCC, and precuneus (Buckner et al., 2008; Raichle et al., 2001). For happy expressions, older adults recruited the mentalizing brain regions for averted gaze conditions more than in the direct gaze condition, as well as relative to their younger counterparts. This ﬁnding is in line with the results from the whole-brain analyses and might reﬂect welldocumented motivational changes away from negative and toward positive information shown to occur with age (Carstensen, 2006).  4.1. Eye-gaze modulation to angry expression  Younger adults recruited areas of a more localized brain network including insula and anterior cingulate regionsdmajor nodes of a salience networkdduring recognition of angry expression with direct relative to averted gaze. The engagement of the salience network is in line with the notion that angry expressions with  190  M. Ziaei et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 48 (2016) 182e194  Fig. 5.

Therefore, a less distributed neural activation and fewer executive control regions should be required to recognize angry expressions with direct gaze. On the other hand, younger adults recruited a more distributed network of regions, including more frontoparietal  regions during averted gaze. Because angry expressions with averted gaze convey ambiguous signals to the observer (Adams et al., 2003; Adams and Kleck, 2005), it was anticipated that angry expressions with averted gaze would impose greater demands on cognitive operations such as executive control and core social cognitive brain regions to understand the mental states of the  Table 4 Peak coordinates for clusters from brain-behavior analyses for angry expressions and Reading the Mind in the Eye Test (RMET) performance  Table 5 Peak coordinates for clusters from brain-behavior analyses for happy expressions and Reading the Mind in the Eye Test (RMET) performance  M.

The whole-brain results therefore aligned with our predictions that 2 different networks of brain regions should be involved among young adults for processing angry expressions, 1 involved in encoding threatening signals with direct gaze and 1 engaged social cognitive processes when the expressions were presented with averted gaze. It has to be noted that the 2 LVs yield 2 brain patterns that are orthogonal to each other, suggesting that the 2 brain patterns revealed for the angry direct and averted conditions are meaningfully different from each other.  Older adults, on the other hand, recruited a distributed and large-scale pattern of brain activity, during the recognition of angry expressions irrespective of the eye gaze. This ﬁnding provides support for the age-related neural dedifferentiation hypothesis, whereby older adults show reduced distinctiveness of neural representation 2001).  domain-speciﬁc  areas  al.,  (Li  in  et  Key: BA, Brodmann area; BSR, bootstrap ratio; Hem, hemisphere; L, left; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; R, right; x coordinate, right/left; y coordinate, anterior/posterior; z coordinate, superior/inferior.  Dedifferentiation has been evidenced in a variety of cognitive tasks in late adulthood, including memory processing (Carp et al., 2010, 2011; St-Laurent et al., 2011), visual perception (Park et al., 2004), as well as cognitive load-dependent processes (Burianová et al., 2015; Grady, 2008). The pattern of dedifferentiation among older adults in the present study suggests that they might exert greater executive control than needed when processing angry expressions (Dirnberger et al., 2010). The lack of speciﬁcity in recruiting brain networks for angry expressions with different eye gaze among older cohorts is also consistent with behavioral ﬁndings showing less distinction between interpreting angry expressions with direct and averted gaze (Slessor et al., 2010). This ﬁnding may reﬂect a neural inefﬁciency in older adults processing threatening stimuli. This pattern of response may be related to the greater cognitive control resources older adults recruit while processing angry expressions or the regulatory effort they employ during processing of these emotions (Ebner et al., 2012).  Fig. 6. Brain-behavior results for happy expressions and theory of mind (TOM) measure.

Ziaei et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 48 (2016) 182e194  In the present study, we found no age difference in behavioral performance on the emotion recognition task. However, given that the task is not demanding in general and all our older adult participants were high functioning as indicated by their performance on the background cognitive assessments, behavioral differences were not anticipated. It is also important to note that all participants were trained and practiced the task prior to the fMRI session. The reason for training participants prior to the fMRI task was in fact to try and ensure that the performance of the groups for accurate detecting the faces was equated, so that any differences at the neural level could not simply be attributed to differences in performance. Therefore, the relatively low demands of the task, the high functioning nature of the older adult cohort, as well as the training procedure used likely all contributed to the 2 groups’ similar behavioral performance.  4.2. Angry expressions and TOM  Younger adults who were better at recognizing angry faces with averted gaze and who also obtained higher scores on the measure of TOM obtained from RMET, showed greater recruitment of the anterior PFC regions, such as medial PFC and IFG. In revealing a correlation between activity in mPFC, TOM scores, and accuracy in emotion recognition in the present data suggests that the recognition of angry expressions with averted gaze (relative to direct gaze) may impose greater social cognitive demands relying on mPFC and IFG as key regions of the mentalizing network (Schurz et al., 2014). Task-related activation differences also emerged, whereby angry expressions with averted gaze engaged anterior brain regions and angry expression with direct gaze engaged more posterior regions, supporting functional specialization of the mentalizing network (Schurz et al., 2014).  In contrast to their younger counterparts, older adults showed no reliable association between task performance and TOM scores. In addition, older adults’ TOM capacity was only correlated with activity in the posterior parts of the mentalizing network, such as the parietal region, when they were making explicit judgments about emotional expression of angry faces in the scanner task. The absence of any association between anterior PFC and TOM scores in older adults is consistent with the results of Moran et al. (2012), who also found age-related decline in recruitment of dorsal mPFC during various social cognitive tasks. The age-related decline in integrating facial cues during recognition of angry expressions could potentially be associated with older adults’ difﬁculties in reorienting social attention or higher-order mentalizing processes during averted gaze in angry faces, as this was the condition that imposed greatest demands on social cognitive ability. It is possible that the extent of age-related differences in neural regions is predictive of behavioral age differences in processing and implicitly responding to basic facial cues as well as social cognitive tasks.  4.3. Eye-gaze modulation to happy expression  For happy expressions, whole-brain analyses revealed that older adults recruited 2 networks of brain regions as a function of direct versus averted gaze. This gaze-dependent differentiation was unique to older adults, as no neural modulation was found for younger adults in response to eye-gaze direction. Older adults’ greater sensitivity to eye gaze when processing happy expressions coupled with older adult’s insensitivity to eye-gaze cues when processing angry expressions, align with ﬁndings on the positivity effect in aging (Reed and Carstensen, 2012; Reed et al., 2014), showing age-related biases in attention, memory, and decisionmaking toward positive emotional information (Brassen et al., 2011; Mather and Carstensen, 2003, 2005; Ziaei et al., 2015).  Speciﬁcally, the current data showing greater sensitivity to happy expressions with different eye gaze cues may most parsimoniously be explained in terms of the well-documented motivational shifts seen in late compared to young adulthood. One of the ways in which this motivational shift is argued to manifest is via an agerelated positivity effect, whereby older adults exhibit greater attention toward and memory for positive relative to negatively valenced information (Reed et al., 2014). The present study indicates that older adults’ attentional bias may also be reﬂected at the neural level, via the recruitment of differential neural substrates toward positive expressions with different social communicative cues. As noted, this neural sensitivity was not evident for negative facial expressions. It has to be noted that depending on this region’s functional network, mPFC could be involved in mentalizing, selfreferential, pain, reward, or social cognitive processing (Roy et al., 2012). Although much remained to be addressed about the role of the vmPFC in each of these domains, the functional network connected to this region seems to be essential in understanding the processes that this region subserves for any particular task.  In line with the dedifferentiation hypothesis, in the present study, older adults’ brain activity was indistinguishable for direct and averted eye gaze. That is, older adults recruited the same, single network for both angry direct and averted gaze conditions. However, recognition of happy expressions is presumably easier for older adults and/or they are more motivated to process these expressions in general (consistent with socioemotional selectivity theory). Therefore, as a result of greater availability of cognitive resources while processing happy expressions, older adults are able to differentiate between direct and averted gaze for happy expressions. Taken together, the dedifferentiation explanation for angry expressions is not in contradiction with the ﬁndings for happy expressions, as angry and happy conditions may differ in their relative cognitive demands.  4.4. Happy expressions and TOM  Additionally, the brain regions involved during recognition of happy expressions and correlated with TOM scores support the motivational shift toward positive information. Brain areas mainly included the parietal lobes, mPFC, PCC, and STGdthe main nodes of DMN (Buckner et al., 2008; Raichle et al., 2001). Previous studies found increased activity of vmPFC during happy relative to angry expressions (Ebner et al., 2012). There is an overlap between the coordinates they reported with the mPFC region found in this study. Activity of this region is thought to reﬂect affective responses to cues which may be associated with reward (Roy et al., 2012) and lower cognitive demand. In other words, happy expressions seem to be more easily accessible and require lower cognitive demand, which consequently engage DMN more than angry expressions. Furthermore, engagement of DMN during recognition of happy expressions is consistent with TOM studies that reveal activity of DMN components. One of the subregions of this network, the mPFC, is activated when “thinking about the complex interactions among people that are conceived of as being social, interactive, and emotive like oneself” (Buckner et al., 2008, p. 24). The correlations identiﬁed between DMN activity and TOM scores during recognition of happy expressions, therefore suggest that older adults may be motivated to engage in social cognitive processing when the facial cues are of particular interest to them (i.e., depict positive affective states), and consequently, they will notice the facial cues expressed with happy facial expressions more than angry expressions.  One potential mechanism that may contribute to the observed age differences are the well-documented changes in neural structural integrity seen in late adulthood (for reviews see Grady, 2012;  M. Ziaei et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 48 (2016) 182e194  193  Li et al., 2001). Several studies have now shown important links between gray- and white-matter structural integrity and functional brain activity (Burianová et al., 2015; de Chastelaine et al., 2011; Legon et al., 2015; Persson et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2015). Therefore, it is possible that structural changes underlie the age-related differences processing emotional expressions identiﬁed in the present study. Future studies are needed to test this possibility and investigate how age-related structural changes in main nodes of emotional processing, such as the amygdala, and white matter tracks between the amygdala and PFC, such as uncinate fasciculus, are related to brain activity when processing emotional expressions.  Finally, 2 methodological limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. First, most of the neuroimaging literature focused on emotion processing used 3 emotions, angry, happy, and neutral expressions which limit inferences about potential age-related changes for other emotions. Future neuroimaging studies should also include other emotional expressions such as fear and disgust to advance insights into the nature and magnitude of age-related change in the neural networks that subserve these critical social cognitive operations. Second, the perceptual properties of the happy faces and, in particular, the fact that teeth were visible, could have inﬂuenced the ﬁndings of this study. This is because visible teeth have been shown to create an advantage in detecting happy faces in visual search paradigms (Horstmann and Ansorge, 2009) and may, therefore, have facilitated faster response times for happy expressions in both age groups. Thus, while an important consideration in this study was to use stimuli that represent natural emotional expressions as closely as possible, further investigation is now needed to examine the contribution of speciﬁc perceptual features, such as teeth, in integrating facial cues among both age groups.  Nevertheless, these caveats aside, the present study is the ﬁrst to provide evidence that the brain networks that subserve the recognition of angry expressions are modulated by eye-gaze direction for younger but not older adults. For happy expressions, the reverse pattern of neural speciﬁcity emerged, with older (but not younger) adults showing neural sensitivity to eye-gaze direction. These results are consistent with the broader gerontological literature that shows that there are motivational shifts toward positive emotional information in late adulthood. Moreover, the pattern of brain-behavior correlations showed that 2 networks of brain regions were differentially correlated with TOM abilities and the ability to recognize angry expressions as a function of eye gaze but only among younger adults. Taken together, these ﬁndings provide novel insights into the underlying brain networks involved in processing socially communicative signals. Given that a core feature of many psychiatric, neurological, and neurodegenerative illnesses is impaired social cognitive abilities (Henry et al., 2016; Poletti et al., 2012; Sprong et al., 2007; Stewart et al., 2016; Yu and Wu, 2013), in the long term, this information has the potential to be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of many clinical disorders.

Experiment 1 examined the common and distinct neural bases of direct appraisals of the self, close others, and normative judgments of trait desirability. All three judgment types activated medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) to a similar degree. Experiment 2 examined the common and distinct neural bases of (1) direct appraisals of self, a close other or a non-close other, and (2) reflected appraisals made from the perspective of a close or a non-close other. Consistent with Experiment 1, all types activated MPFC. Direct appraisals of the self as compared to others more strongly recruited MPFC and right rostrolateral PFC. Direct appraisals as compared to reflected appraisals recruited regions associated with a first-person perspective (posterior cingulate), whereas reflected as compared to direct appraisals recruited regions associated with emotion and memory (insula, orbitofrontal, and temporal cortex). These results support models suggesting that MPFC mediates meta-cognitive processes that may be recruited for direct and reflected self appraisals depending upon the demands of a specific task.

Am I friendly? Am I outgoing? Am I aggressive or anxious or eager? To answer these  F seen  _  questions, contemporary social psychological theories suggest that there are at least two appraisals of the self upon which we draw (Baumeister, 1998; Fiske, 2004; Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Shrauger and Schoeneman, 1999). Direct appraisals draw primarily upon semantic self-knowledge abstracted from previous experiences, although in some cases, self appraisals might draw upon episodic knowledge of specific life events (Kihlstrom et al., 2003; Klein et al., 1989, 1996; Markus, 1977; Tulving et al., 1988). By contrast, reflected appraisals draw on our beliefs about how we are seen by others. The person in reflected appraisals has been termed ‘‘The Looking Glass Self’’ (Cooley, 1902; Mead, 1934).1 For much of the past century, behavioral researchers have asked two distinct but related questions about the mechanisms underlying direct and reflected appraisals. The first question is whether direct appraisals of the self are insofar as they draw upon different informational bases and inferential processes used to directly appraise other individuals. For example, it is possible that evaluating your own friendliness recruits highly accessible memory representations that are more structured and complex than those used to evaluate the friendliness of a work colleague (Dweck et al., 2003; Higgins and Bargh, 1987; Symons and Johnson, 1997). At best, there is mixed evidence to support this claim. On one hand, memory is enhanced for traits evaluated in relation to the self in comparison to other targets. This memory advantage has been argued to reflect something about the unique organizational structure of self-knowledge (Maki and McCaul, 1985; McCaul and Maki, 1984; Rogers et al., 1977). On the other hand, similar levels of memory are observed for stimuli whose representations are equated for complexity of organization and/or elaboration (Klein and Kihlstrom, 1986; Symons and Johnson, 1997).  _ special,  special  F  F  _  * Corresponding author.

Available online on ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com).  1 A variant on this second possibility is that self-knowledge derives not just partially, but almost completely from our perceptions of others (Cooley, 1902; Lewin, 1951; Mead, 1934; cf. Bem, 1967).  1053-8119/$ - see front matter D 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.06.069  798  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  The second question is to what extent direct and reflected appraisals – which are often conceptualized as distinct processes – may share similar inferential and informational bases. For example, our beliefs about what others think of us could be based on our own beliefs about ourselves. Research suggests that reflected appraisals are correlated more strongly with direct self appraisals than they are with actual feedback from others (Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Krueger, 2003). This suggests that reflected appraisals may reflect our own beliefs about ourselves more than they reflect accurate knowledge about others’ views.  this may be the case:  Although no prior  functional neuroimaging work has included both direct and reflected appraisals, the results of studies examining each in isolation can be used to formulate predictions about the common and distinct neural correlates of self appraisals. To examine direct self the two types of  Table 1 Judgment conditions included in studies of self-reference and perspective taking  Target of belief  Perspective  the self-reference effect  appraisals, some studies have adapted methodological techniques from studies of in memory. This approach contrasts self-descriptive judgments with other types of judgment to isolate neural systems associated specifically with the access of information about the self. As illustrated in Table 1, comparison conditions have included judging traits of familiar persons (i.e., a political figure, a close other), judging the social desirability of the words possess some perceptual characteristic unrelated to their meaning. Results have suggested that self-reference may be both and ordinary: greater MPFC activation is found when judging whether trait words describe the self as compared to a non-close other (George Bush), but both types of judgments recruit other regions involved in memory retrieval, such as left inferior prefrontal to the same degree as the other-referential cortex (PFC), judgments (Kelley et al., 2002; Macrae et al., 2004).

Text in italics indicates the instructions given in the present experiments for specific types of direct and reflected appraisals. Targets are the individuals about whom thoughts/beliefs/feelings are held and judgments are made. Perspectives refer to the person _ who holds the thought/belief/feeling. Among studies examining judgments about what would be believed by another person (i.e., what is believed from their perspective), only the present Experiments 1 and 2 involve reflected appraisals of the beliefs that another person holds about you, the experimental participant (see text for full description of conditions in present experiments). In this context, a normative perspective is a form of reflected appraisal that of beliefs nor a specific target of them. Superscripted numerals indicate: 1Judging whether a trait adjective describes you involves neither a specific (yes/no); 2judging your own emotional response to a photo or the emotion expressed by a figure in the photo; 3judging what you believe or the average person would believe about medical/health issues; 4predicting either your own or your mother’s emotional reactions to an event; 5judging what you believe or a vignette character believes about an event described in the vignette; 6judging social desirability of trait; 7judging positivity of trait.

Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  799  activation has been reported during similar kinds of selfreferential assessment (Craik et al., 1999; Fossati et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2002) as well as during other types of selfreflective processing that involve awareness of one’s own current thoughts or feelings (e.g., Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Lieberman et al., 2004; McGuire et al., 1996; Ochsner et al., 2004). On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that MPFC may play a special role in mediating access to self-knowledge in general (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Kelley et al., 2002; Macrae et al., 2004). Other findings suggest, however, that self-reference may involve other regions as well. For example, self-referential processing has been associated with activity in posterior cingulate/precuneus (Fossati et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2002; Kircher et al., 2002; Schmitz et al., 2004) and is disrupted by transcranial magnetic stimulation over this region (Lou et al., 2004). Furthermore, some studies have failed to show greater MPFC activation, observing instead activation in lateral prefrontal or parietal systems (Kircher et al., 2002; Schmitz et al., 2004).  Two studies of self-reference included normative appraisals of trait desirability. The first observed greater MPFC activity for self appraisals compared to appraisals of the positivity of trait adjectives (Schmitz et al., 2004), and the second found similar patterns of MPFC activity for self appraisals and appraisals of trait desirability (Fossati et al., 2003). Four other studies have directly compared first-person (what I think/feel) as compared to third-person (what another person thinks/feels) judgments about beliefs and feelings that are not directly related to the self. Three of these studies suggest that greater MPFC activation is associated with judging another’s beliefs or emotions as compared to judging either one’s own belief or emotions (Ruby and Decety, 2003, 2004; Vogeley et al., 2001) or non-mentalistic baseline judgments (Ochsner et al., 2004). One study found greater MPFC activation for self than for other judgments, however, and that other judgments activated left lateral PFC (Ochsner et al., 2004). More generally, studies comparing mental and non-mental state inferences about others have found MPFC activation along with other regions including the superior temporal sulcus, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and temporal pole (for review, see (Adolphs, 2003; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Ochsner et al., 2004).  The preceding review presents a complex and somewhat contradictory picture of the relationship between specific brain systems and direct or reflected appraisals of the self. On one hand, it is possible that there are consistent neural correlates of each type of appraisal, but the ability to detect them may have been obscured by methodological shortcomings. For example, in prior work, the degree of familiarity has not been systematically manipulated, which could influence recruitment of brain systems. On the other hand, extant results do suggest that MPFC, as well as a number of other commonly activated posterior medial and temporal regions, plays a role in drawing inferences about enduring traits and mental states. Therefore, they may play important roles in both direct and reflected appraisals about the self concept.  relationship intimacy or  The specific question addressed by the present research is: what exactly are those roles? Complexities and inconsistencies aside, prior research suggests three possibilities. The first is that MPFC (or some subregions of it, as well as allied medial and temporal regions) supports inferences about one’s own current states and dispositions, perhaps because MPFC supports access to internal cues available only for one’s own mental states (Gusnard et al., 2001; Kelley et al., 2002; Ochsner et al., 2004). The second is that  MPFC is involved specifically in adopting the perspective of and/ or making judgments about the mental states of other people (Ruby and Decety, 2003, 2004). The third possibility is that MPFC performs computations common to both of these processes, including those involved in meta-cognitive judgments that require explicit representation of what one knows (Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Lieberman and Pfeifer, in press; Ochsner et al., 2004). In this case, activation in MPFC (and allied regions) may depend upon the meta-cognitive processing demands intrinsic to a specific experimental situation.  The present studies address these possibilities using functional magnetic resonance imaging in two experiments that systematically varied the target of judgments about personality (thereby varying the kind of personal knowledge accessed) as well as the first or third-person perspective taken when making those judgments (thereby varying direct versus reflected appraisals). this study was the opportunity to A particular strength of compare results from two experiments that included both overlapping and distinct task conditions and statistical analyses but used slightly different experimental methods and data collected from different scanners. Comparing and contrasting patterns of activation across two experiments that systematically varied task conditions should provide converging evidence concerning the common and distinct processes underlying the direct and reflected routes to self-knowledge.  Experiment 1  Experiment 1 addresses two specific questions concerning the neural systems specifically recruited during direct appraisals of one’s own self concept. First, we asked whether judging one’s own personality traits is similar to judging the traits of a close other with whom one has a great deal of information/experience. Second, we asked whether making self-assessments of personality is similar to making assessments of social desirability. The latter comparison included a condition that required adopting the normative perspective of the ‘‘average person’’ and provided a control condition for the possibility that self appraisals reflect processes that bias us to think positively of ourselves (Robins and Beer, 2001; Taylor and Brown, 1988).  Methods  Participants  17 Participants (9 female, M age = 29 years) were recruited in compliance with the human subjects regulations of the University of California, Berkeley, and were compensated $15/h for their participation. All participants were screened for medications or psychological and/or neurological conditions that might influence the measurement of cerebral blood flow.  Behavioral paradigm  Participants completed four types of blocks (see Table 1) each comprised of 6 positive and 6 negative trait adjectives drawn from the normed lists of Craik et al. (1999). Word length, number of syllables, valence, and frequency ratings for word types were equated across four stimulus sets that were types. On Self blocks, counterbalanced across four judgment participants were instructed to judge whether the adjective described them. On Other blocks, participants judged whether  800  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  the adjective described a close other that had been identified by each participant before the experiment began. On Positive blocks, participants judged whether each adjective described a trait that most people would consider a positive personality characteristic. On Syllable blocks, participants judged whether the adjective contained two syllables. Each of the 12 trials in each block began with a screen containing an instructional cue above a fixation point for 2.2 s (all timing was TRs). The instructional cue remained but the crosshair was then replaced with a trait adjective for 2.2 s, while participants made a yes/no binary judgment. Participants made their judgments using the thumbs of their left and right hands on a two-button response box. Positive and negative words were presented in an optimized pseudorandom order within blocks with jittered intertrial intervals (ITIs) that varied from 4 to 8 s with an average interval of 5.16 s (Donaldson et al., 2001). The task scans each consisting of 4 comprised four 8-min 56-s pseudorandomly ordered blocks (each lasting 110 s, including 12 4-s trials per block and jittered ITIs) with 24-s fixation rest periods following each block.  that  Stimuli were projected onto a screen mounted on a custom head coil limited head motion using foam padding. Stimulus presentation and response collection were controlled by the program E-prime running on a Windows 98 Computer.  MRI data acquisition  All  images were acquired with a 4-T Varian INOVA MR scanner and a TEM send and receive RF head coil. Functional images were acquired during four runs lasting 536 s each, using a two-shot gradient echo echo-planar image (EPI) sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 2.2 s (echo time of ), resulting in 244 total volumes 28 ms, and flip angle of 20 acquired. Whole brain volumes consisted of twenty 3.5-mm axial slices with a 5-mm interslice gap. Each slice was acquired with a 22.4 cm2 field of view with a 64  64 matrix size, resulting in an in-plane resolution of 3  3 mm. Highresolution (0.875  0.875 mm) in-plane T1-weighted anatomical images were also acquired using a gradient echo multislice (GEMS) sequence for anatomical localization. Finally, MP-Flash 3D T1-weighted scans were acquired so that functional data could be normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas space.  MRI data analysis  All statistical analyses were conducted using SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology). Functional images acquired from the scanner were reconstructed from k space time interpolation algorithm to double the using a linear effective sampling rate. Image volumes were corrected for slice-timing skew using temporal sinc interpolation and corrected for movement using rigid-body transformation parameters. Images were then smoothed with an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel and masked using a full-brain mask to remove extraneous signal as a result of ghosting. To remove drifts within sessions, a high-pass filter with a cutoff period of 200 s was applied.  A fixed effects analysis was used to model both block and event-related responses for each participant. Responses related to the instructional cues and the onset of each positive or negative word stimulus were modeled with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Block-level responses corresponding to each instruction type were modeled using a boxcar regressor convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response. A general linear model analysis then was used to create contrast images for each participant summarizing differences between block types, and these images were used to create group average SPM{t} maps that were thresholded at P < .001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons, with an extent threshold of 5 voxels. This threshold was adopted in both experiments for regions of a priori interest shown prior work to be involved in self-referential and/or social cognitive judgments and the retrieval of episodic memories (including medial and lateral PFC, anterior and posterior cingulate/precuneus, insula, medial and anterior temporal lobe, and superior parietal cortex). Maxima are reported in ICMB152 coordinates as in SPM2.

Neither contrast showed activation of any regions when the threshold was lowered to P < 0.005. At an even more liberal threshold of P < 0.01, activation of MPFC was not observed in either contrast.  Discussion  that  The results of Experiment 1 indicate that in comparison to baseline perceptual judgments of trait adjectives, direct appraisals of the self recruit MPFC, but these regions are no different than those recruited by direct appraisals of a close other or judgments of the normative positivity of trait words. These findings suggest that prior demonstrations of MPFC activity during direct appraisals of the self may have been attributable to their comparison with direct appraisals of nonclose others, such as the US President or Canadian Prime Minister, with whom one has little personal experience and whom one may be quite dissimilar (e.g., Craik et al., 1999; Kelley et al., 2002). Only one prior study has compared directly judgments about self and a close other (Schmitz et al., 2004) and, like the present findings, did not observe greater recruitment of MPFC. However, unlike that study, we did not observe greater activation for Self as compared to Positivity judgments (cf. Fossati et al., 2003).  Experiment 2  Experiment 2 directly and systematically addressed two specific questions concerning direct and reflected appraisals of the self. The first was a follow-up to the finding from the neural systems correlated with direct Experiment 1 that appraisals of the self and a close other were quite similar. Experiment 2 compares direct appraisals of the self with a close other and a non-close other to examine how activation varies with relationship intimacy (cf. Craik et al., 1999; Kelley et al., 2002). The second question concerned the relationship between direct appraisals of the self and reflected appraisals of the self made from the perspective of either the (a) close other or (b) the non-close other. Based on the findings from Experiment 1, we hypothesized that self and close other judgments – including adopting the reflected perspective of a close other on one’s self – should reveal similar patterns of activation because each type of judgment relies upon access to similar/overlapping pools of semantic person knowledge (Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Klein et al., 1997). In contrast, we hypothesized that making judgments about, or adopting the perspective of, a non-close other with whom one is less familiar than a close other could depend upon neural systems different than those involved in self judgments (Klein et al., 1997).  802  Methods  Participants  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  Sixteen participants (9 female, M age = 22.95 years) were recruited in compliance with the human subjects regulations of Stanford University and were compensated $20/h for their participation. All participants were screened for medications or psychological and/or neurological conditions that might influence the measurement of cerebral blood flow.  Behavioral paradigm  Participants completed six types of blocks (see Table 1) each comprised of 4 trials with positive and 4 trials with negative trait adjectives drawn from the stimulus lists employed by Craik et al. (1999). Word length, number of syllables, valence, and frequency ratings for word types were equated across six sets of 8 words each that were counterbalanced across six judgment types. Prior to the onset of each block, one of six instructional cues was presented in the center of the screen twice (using the same timing as regular judgment trials, see below) that indicated which judgment participants were to make for each trait adjective using a four-point scale. On You About Self blocks, participants were instructed to judge the extent to which the adjective described them (1 = not at all; 4 = very much). On You About Friend blocks, participants judged the extent to which the adjective described their best friend and/or relationship partner, whose identity had been specified before the experiment began. On You About Other blocks, participants judged the extent to which each adjective described a non-close individual whose identity had been specified prior to the experiment as a teaching assistant from a class taken the previous semester with whom the participant had not become friends. On Friend About You blocks, participants judged the extent to which their designated close other would judge the adjective to describe them. On Other About You blocks, participants judged the extent to which their designated non-close other would judge the adjective to describe them. On baseline Curved Lines blocks, participants judged the extent to which the adjective contained curved as compared to straight lines (1 = very few, <25% curved; 4 = very many, >75% curved). Each trial began with a fixation point presented in the center of the screen for 250 ms, followed by the stimulus adjective for 1250 ms, a rating scale for 2250 ms that included the instructional cue and labeled endpoints, and finally a 250-ms ITI. Participants made their judgments using the index through little fingers of their dominant right hand on a four button response box with the index finger always corresponding to the maximum response option for each judgment. Pre-block instructional cues were presented using the same event sequence as regular judgment trials with the exception that the fixation crossed was presented instead of a rating scale. Within each block, positive and negative words were presented in a counterbalanced pseudorandom order. To jitter the interval between trial types, a total of 48 fixation trials were distributed throughout the 36 judgment blocks, with the constraint that each block contains at least one fixation trial. Thus, four blocks contained one and two blocks contained two fixation trials that were identical to curved lines trials with the exception that a fixation cross was presented instead of a trait adjective. The entire task was comprised of six functional runs each lasting 6 min 6 s. Each run included one block of each of the seven  for each judgment  type,  types presented in pseudorandom counterbalanced judgment order, with each block comprised of 9 or 10 trials (4 negative, 4 positive, 1 – 2 fixation) that were preceded by 4 s of instructional cue.  Stimuli were projected onto a screen mounted on a custom head coil that limited head motion using a bitebar. Stimulus presentation and response collection were controlled by the program Psycscope v1.2 running on a Macintosh G3 Computer. A separate training and practice session were conducted at the Psychology Department approximately 2 – 5 days prior to the scanning session in order to select close and non-close other individuals and to familiarize participants with the task.  MRI data acquisition  Whole brain fMRI data (28 axial slices, 4 mm thick) were collected at 3 T (GE Signa LX Horizon Echospeed Scanner) with a T2*-sensitive gradient echo spiral-in/out pulse sequence (30 ms TE, 2000 ms TR, 2 interleaves, 60 flip angle, 24-cm field of view, 64  64 data acquisition matrix). T2-weighted flow-compensated spin echo scans were acquired for anatomical reference using the same slice prescription (2000 ms TR; 85 ms TE).  MRI data analysis  All statistical analyses were conducted using SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology). Anatomical images first were coregistered to the mean functional image and normalized to a standard template brain. Functional images were slice time and motion-corrected, normalized to parameters derived from the anatomical normalization, interpolated to 2  2  2 mm voxels, and smoothed with a Gaussian filter (6-mm full width half maximum). To remove drifts within sessions, a high-pass filter with a cutoff period two times the block length (64 s) was applied.  A fixed effects analysis was used to model both block and event-related responses for each participant. The instructional cue proceeding each block was modeled with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Block-level responses corresponding to each instruction type were modeled using a boxcar regressor convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response. A general linear model analysis then was used to create contrast images for each participant summarizing differences between block types, and these images were used to create group average SPM{t} maps that were thresholded as in Experiment 1 at P < 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons, with an extent threshold of 5 voxels. Maxima are reported in ICMB152 coordinates as in SPM2.  Results  Behavioral data  Response times for judgments involving the self or a close other were made with similar speed (You About Self, M = 1240.3 ms; You About Friend, M = 1234.9 ms; Friend About You, M = 1225.4 ms; all planned pairwise t’s < 1). Judgments involving a non-close other and baseline perceptual judgments of curved lines were made with equal speed, and these three judgments were made more slowly than were the three judgments involving the self or close other (You About Other, M = 1296.7 ms; Other About You, M = 1278.9 ms; Curved Lines, M = 1337.9 ms; pairwise t(15) < 1.9, P > 0.08; for comparisons with judgments involving self or close other, planned t’s > 2.3, P < 0.05).  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  803  Imaging data  Regions involved in direct self appraisals that  required accessing different types of person knowledge were identified in the three separate contrasts of You About Self, You About Friend, or You About Other trials > Curved Lines trials. Regions involved in reflected appraisals of the self from the perspective of other people were identified in contrasts of the Friend About You or Other About You trials > Curved Lines trials. All of these contrasts produced strikingly similar patterns of activation, which included regions of MPFC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) spanning their dorsal (BAs 8 – 9) to ventral (BAs 10, 25) extent, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus, inferior parietal cortex, and the middle and inferior temporal gyri and temporal pole. Because these patterns of activation were so similar, in order to streamline presentation of these data, the intersection of all regions activated for each of these contrasts is shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2.  Direct self appraisals recruited regions distinct from those associated with direct appraisals of a friend or non-close other. As shown in the top half of Table 4, the You About Self > You About Friend and You About Self > You About Other contrasts both activated right lateral PFC (Fig. 3a), with the latter contrast additionally activating dorsal MPFC, anterior cingulate, and superior parietal cortex (Fig. 3b). The reverse of those two contrasts identified regions more active when accessing knowledge about a friend or close other as compared to the self. As shown in the bottom half of Table 4, the You About Friend > You About Self contrast activated both dorsal and ventral portions of MPFC as well as anterior cingulate cortex, right anterior insula,  and dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortex bilaterally, whereas the You About Other > You About Self contrast activated primarily the right inferior temporal gyrus, the parahippocampus, and the pons.  Two contrasts identified regions more active when accessing self-knowledge via direct appraisals from a first-person perspective as compared to reflected appraisals from a third-person perspective. As shown in the top half of Table 5 and Fig. 4a, the You About Self > Friend About You contrast activated posterior cingulate cortex. The You About Self > Other About You contrast also activated posterior cingulate cortex as well as the insula and superior parietal cortex. The reverse of those two contrasts identified regions more active when accessing knowledge about the self by reflected as compared to direct appraisals. As shown in the bottom half of Table 5 and Fig. 4b, the Friend About You > You About Self contrast activated right orbital, insular, and parahippocampal cortices, the left lingual gyrus and the cerebellum, whereas the Other About You > You About Self contrast activated middle and inferior temporal gyri and the pons.  Discussion  Experiment 2 addressed two important issues concerning the neural correlates of self-knowledge: whether similar systems mediate access to self-knowledge as compared to knowledge of close or non-close others, and what systems mediate direct and reflected self appraisals.

Top panels show lateral and bottom panels show medial views of the cortical surface. Because these patterns of activation were so similar, in order to streamline presentation of these data, activations represented the intersection of all regions activated for each of five contrasts comparing direct appraisals (You About Self, You About Friend, and You About Other trials) or reflected appraisals (Friend About You, Other About You trials) with activation on baseline Curved Lines trials.  appraisals of trait descriptiveness for the self, close others, and non-close others – a finding that dovetails with and extends the findings of Experiment 1 – and (2) with reflected appraisals about the self made from the third-person perspective of a close or nonclose other.  The striking similarity of activations for the three types of direct appraisal and two types of reflected appraisal are illustrated vividly in Table 3 and Fig. 2, which show common recruitment not only of MPFC, but of a larger network of regions including posterior cingulate/precuneus and multiple regions of the temporal lobe spanning its superior to polar extent. The dual role of these regions in direct and reflected self appraisals fits with prior work showing involvement of MPFC in mental state attribution for both self and other (Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Mitchell et al., 2004; Ochsner et al., 2004), posterior cingulate/precuneus in emotional evaluation and perspective taking (Gallagher et al., 2000; Kelley et al., 2002; Kircher et al., 2002; Lieberman et al., 2004; Maddock et al., 2003; Wicker et al., 2003), and middle and polar temporal regions in representing linguistic and semantic information useful for self-monitoring and person memory (Hashimoto and Sakai, 2003; Paller et al., 2003). Representing mental states, evaluating their valence, shifting between first and third-person perspectives, and retrieving personal attributes from memory all may play an essential role in direct and reflected appraisals.  Experiment 2 was the first  to directly compare personality evaluations of the self, a close other, and a non-close other in a single study, which allows identification of regions associated with accessing knowledge about the self as compared to either  highly familiar or less familiar individuals that may or may not be similar to you. As was observed in Experiment 1, activation when directly appraising one’s own traits was very similar to that observed when appraising a close friend’s traits. The only prior study comparing activation for self and a close other also found greater activation of right lateral PFC, but not MPFC (Schmitz et al., 2004). At a slightly relaxed threshold ( P < 0.005), we too observed greater activity only in right lateral PFC, in a rostral region which has been associated with the evaluation of self-generated information (Christoff and Gabrieli, 2000). By contrast, prior studies comparing appraisals of self and non-close others have reported greater MPFC activation (e.g., Kelley et al., 2002). We too observed this effect, albeit once again at a slightly relaxed threshold, in MPFC regions somewhat more dorsal to those reported previously but which have been associated with self-referential processing nonetheless (for other studies showing similar foci of activation, see Table 6). The increasing recruitment of dorsal MPFC for judgments of targets more like the self suggests that this region may support high level representation and awareness of cognitive and emotional states that help differentiate self from other (cf. Gusnard et al., 2001; Lane and McRae, in press). This hypothesis is consistent with prior findings showing greater dorsal MPFC activation for judgments of one’s own as compared to a non-close other’s emotional state (Ochsner et al., 2004). The region of right rostral lateral PFC observed in the You About Self > You About Friend contrast was also activated in the You About Self > You About Other contrast, suggesting that it may play a general role in evaluating self-generated information pertaining to one’s disposition (Christoff and Gabrieli, 2000).  K.N.

Experiment 2 is also the first study to contrast direct self appraisals made from a first-person perspective with reflected self appraisals made from a third-person perspective. Direct firstperson appraisals activated the midportion of the posterior cingulate more than reflected appraisals made from either the perspective of a close or a non-close other. Comparison with non-close others also revealed greater insula and inferior parietal activation. These findings are consistent with previous research showing insula and posterior cingulate activation when participants adopt a first-person as compared to third-person visual perspective on a display (Vogeley et al., 2004) and left inferior parietal activation associated with discriminating one’s own actions from those of other people (Decety et al., 2002). Regions more activated for third- as compared to first-person appraisals  of self-included structures associated with retrieval of episodic and semantic information as well as emotion. Thus, reflecting on a close other’s opinions about you (as compared to your own opinions of yourself) activated right orbitofrontal cortex, insula and parahippocampus, which have been associated with the representation and regulation of emotional/motivational states (Beer et al., 2004; Ochsner and Feldman, 2001) and the retrieval of episodic memory (Kahn et al., 2004), respectively. Reflecting a non-close other’s opinions about you activated middle and inferior temporal regions associated with storing semantic and visual memories for people and objects (Mitchell et al., 2002; Paller et al., 2003). These findings are consistent with the idea that when trying to determine what a relatively unfamiliar person might believe about you, one is more likely to rely on memories  806  K.N.

Alternatively, joint activation of structures associated with regulation, affect, and memory could reflect assessments of how much you like the other person, which could inform judgments of how much they like you back, or it could reflect self-enhancing appraisals motivated by the desire to think others view them positively. In this way, self appraisal may  serve an emotion regulatory function, not unlike reappraisal of aversive events, which also involves orbitofrontal and insular regions (Ochsner et al., 2004).  General discussion  The present set of experiments began with the deceptively simple question: how do we know what were like? The results of two experiments converge to offer an interestingly complex answer.  Neural systems supporting direct and reflected self appraisals  2 Response times were longer on trials involving judgments of a non-close other, which means that regions more active for contrasts involving these judgments could reflect either recruitment of processes unique to thinking about non-close others, or it could reflect engagement for a longer period of time of mechanisms also involved in other judgment types. For example, it is possible that the temporal regions identified in the contrasts of Other About You or You About Other blocks > You About Self blocks are also active when reasoning about one’s self, albeit for a shorter duration of time.  On one hand, MPFC activation was observed in both experiments for all judgments involving direct appraisals of self, a close other, or a non-close other, as well as for all judgments involving reflected appraisals of what those others believe about you. Experiment 2 revealed additional activation associated with these judgments in posterior cingulate/precuneus and temporal cortical regions. Differential MPFC activation was observed for direct  K.N. Ochsner et al. / NeuroImage 28 (2005) 797 – 814  807  appraisals of self in comparison to non-close others but not in comparison to close others, which is consistent with the idea that similar processes may be used to support inferences about the self and those we perceive to be like us (Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Krueger, 2003). More generally, the established association of MPFC, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and temporal regions with both self-referential and social cognitive judgments of various kinds supports the idea that these regions comprise a network important for reasoning about the states and traits of people (Table 6; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Lieberman and Pfeifer, in press; Ochsner et al., 2004).  the orbitofrontal,  On the other hand,  insular, and temporal regions shown here to support a reflected third-person perspective on the self are different than the parietal and medial prefrontal regions associated in prior studies with imagining the visual perspective available to, or beliefs held by, another person (Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Ruby and Decety, 2003, 2004; Vogeley et al., 2004). One possible reason for this discrepancy has to do with differences in the content of stimuli and the judgments made about them.3 Prior studies involving judging the mental states of others  it  is possible that  3 An additional reason why the present study failed to observe medial prefrontal activation when making reflected as compared to direct appraisal has to do with the general concern that the way in which any given selfreferential judgment is made differs when it is performed alone as compared to being performed in the context of other judgments (a problem common to virtually all studies investigating self-referential judgments). In the present Experiment 1, for example, inclusion of both self referential and normative judgments led participants to engage on every trial the processes normally used to make each type of judgment alone. Thus, a participant might judge how friendly they are while the same time monitoring the extent to which friendliness is a positive trait. Conversely, a participant could judge the extent to which friendliness is a positive trait while monitoring the extent to which they themselves are friendly or would want to be friendly. In this way, the processes supporting a normative judgment, which involves reflecting the beliefs of an average person, can be recruited in combination with the processes supporting a self-referential judgment. It is possible that a similar interaction between, or parallel recruitment of, processes supporting direct and reflected appraisals took place in the context of Experiment 2. In this case, participants could be simultaneously activating processes used to judge what they think about themselves and processes used to reflect upon what their close other or nonclose other might think about them. For example, when rating the extent to which a participant thinks she is friendly, she could be monitoring the extent to which her best friend/relationship partner also thinks she is friendly. Similarly, when rating the extent to which her non-close teaching assistant thinks she is diligent, she could be monitoring the extent to which she considers herself diligent. In this way, every judgment condition could involve a high degree of meta-cognitive monitoring as participants are aware of the extent to which each judgment could be made differently from a different perspective. Representing meta-self-knowledge is one function that has been proposed to explain why MPFC is recruited in self referential, social cognitive, and other types of judgment (Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2005; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). The fact that Experiment 2 used the same set of trait adjectives for all judgment conditions could have created circumstances highly conducive to engaging all of the processes simultaneously. The decision to rotate a single set of adjectives through judgment conditions was intended to model social cognitive behavioral paradigms that allow measurement of the extent to which individuals perceive themselves to be similar to close and non-close others. An unintended consequence of this methodological choice may have been an increased reliance of each judgment type on all three processes, which may have recruited MPFC, and in turn could explain why greater MPFC activation was not observed for reflected appraisals. More broadly, this could have made it less likely to observe differences in MPFC activation across conditions.  have employed visual or conceptual judgment targets that may depend more strongly upon motor imagery and visuomotor integration processes associated with parietal cortex (Decety et al., 2002; Ruby and Decety, 2003, 2004), which could explain the failure to observe parietal activation here. Additionally, these targets may have had little autobiographical and/or emotional relevance in comparison to trait adjectives, which could explain why prior studies have failed to activate regions associated with memory or emotion observed here when participants assessed what beliefs others’ might hold about them.  Psychological processes supporting direct and reflected appraisals  Although the striking similarity between brain regions supporting direct and reflected appraisals is consistent with the idea that related psychological processes support them (Kenny and DePaulo, 1993; Krueger, 2003), it is important to consider at least two important questions about this apparent similarity.  The first concerns the fact that there are multiple kinds of reflected appraisals in which a person may engage, each of which may involve different types of psychological processes. For example, the present experiment examined reflected appraisals of the self concept, which likely involved memory retrieval processes, the activation of stored knowledge representations, and/or online inference processes about beliefs and mental states. As described in the preceding and following sections, activation of temporal, cingulate, and medial prefrontal regions may be related to the recruitment of these processes. By contrast, other types of reflected appraisals – such as when one attempts to, , on audience comprehension while delivering an oral presentation – may depend instead (or additionally) upon the online assessment of non-verbal social cues. This ability has been associated with superior and inferior temporal systems different than those identified here (Allison et al., 2000).  F _ get a read  F  _  egocentric  The second question concerns the relevance of the present results to broader debates concerning the way in which we draw inferences about the beliefs, attitudes, and dispositions of other people. Some have argued that the self (i.e., one’s own beliefs, attitudes, etc.) forms the basis of judging others, and that depending upon the context, we may correct for these biases (e.g., Aron et al., 1992; Epley et al., 2004; Krueger, 2003). Others have argued that judgments of others involve the use of abstract person knowledge and/or theories about they way in which individuals behave in general (e.g., Gopnik and Wellman, 1992; Karniol, 2003; Perner et al., 1999). The present study was not designed specifically to discriminate between these alternatives. That being said, greater similarity between patterns of activation for appraisals of self and close as opposed to non-close others is consistent with the idea that others are judged in much the same way as the self (cf. Mitchell et al., 2005). The question of which specific computational processes support is considered in the following section.  this judgment  The role of MPFC in self-reference and social cognition  The increasingly ubiquitous activation of MPFC (and nearby paracingulate cortex) across a variety of tasks ostensibly tapping self-referential, social cognitive, and other types of abilities begs the question of the exact computations carried out in this region (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001).

As can be seen, there is great heterogeneity in the precise coordinates activated across studies. To date, a simple theoretical to emerge for explaining exactly why some tasks activate some regions of MPFC whereas others do not.  framework has yet  _  F intuitive  One suggestion is that like lateral PFC (D’Esposito et al., 2000; Miller and Cohen, 2001), ventral and dorsal regions of MPFC are involved in maintaining different types of representations necessary for task performance. On this view, ventral MPFC (roughly z < 10), which is interconnected with the amygdala and ventral striatum (Ongur et al., 2003; Ongur and Price, 2000), supports the representation of affective and motivational states. These representations may function as feelings about the value of stimuli with respect to current goals and decisions. In contrast, dorsal regions of MPFC (roughly z > 10) that lack these connections may support the re-representation of this information in a symbolic format that is useful for explicitly describing and reasoning about internal states (Lane and McRae, in press; Eisenberger et al. in press; Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2005; Lieberman and Pfeifer, in press; Ochsner et al., 2004). This could explain why in Experiment 2, dorsal MPFC was recruited both when task conditions required reflected appraisals of self and when judgments required direct appraisals of self as compared to a non-close other. It can also explain dorsal MPFC involvement in theory of mind attributions and explicit ratings of current emotional states (Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Ochsner et al., 2004), as compared to ventral MPFC  recruitment for more intuitive forms of self-reference as well as reward-related decision making and conditioned learning (Lieberman et al., 2004; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Ochsner et al., 2004). In this context, it is noteworthy that all judgment types in Experiment 2 activated both dorsal and ventral MPFC in comparison to the perceptual baseline, which may be related to the recruitment of both of these types of processes.4  Is the self  F special  _ ?  Socrates famously admonished his students that they should ‘‘know thyself.’’ The present research suggests that (1) the neural systems (MPFC and rostrolateral PFC) involved in direct appraisals of self and close others may have more in common than those supporting direct appraisals of self and non-close others (Aron et al., 1992; Kenny and DePaulo, 1993), and (2) that direct and reflected  F  _ resting baseline  4 Interestingly, both dorsal and ventral MPFC activity also has been found during so-called conditions in which participants can freely think about whatever they wish as compared to task conditions that require cognitive control of some kind (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001). This has led to the hypothesis that MPFC (along with other regions showing similar resting activity) continuously monitors the internal milieu (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001), and that self-referential and social cognitive judgments required by experimental tasks redirect this default-state processing system (Christoff et al., in press; Iacoboni et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2003). The consistent activation of MPFC for all judgment types relative to the perceptual baseline is consistent with the notion that the monitoring functions ascribed to MPFC may be recruited whenever one engages in self-appraisal.  K.N.

More generally, across all judgment conditions, the recruitment of MPFC and other allied regions was more similar than it was different.  types that  It remains to be seen, however, whether this similarity holds types of direct and reflected appraisals and, more for all generally, whether similar neural systems support all types of judgments involving the self and others. A primary goal for future research should be the identification of task parameters and judgment types of computational processes involved in judgments of self and other. This work will need to address the situational (e.g., a social interaction versus a moment of self-reflection) and motivational (e.g., I want to understand my partner’s feelings about me versus I need to choose a gift for him/her) contexts in which we engage each type of appraisal and recruit particular combinations of underlying neural systems.  recruit distinct  Finally, it is important to note that accomplishment of this longterm goal may hinge upon researchers’ ability to creatively and constructively integrate the theories and methods of social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Whereas the former can help specify when, how, and with what consequences particular appraisals are made, the latter can be used to specify which neural systems may be involved. Such an integrative social cognitive neuroscience approach can be used to construct theories of self appraisals that link multiple levels of analysis (Cacioppo, 2002; Klein and Kihlstrom, 1998; Ochsner and Lieberman, 2001).

Articles are organized alphabetically by judgment Target and Judgment type. For judgment targets: ‘‘self’’ if target is the self, ‘‘NCO’’ if target is a non-close other, ‘‘CO’’ if the target is a close other, ‘‘NORM’’ if the goal is to estimate the (normative) opinion of an average person. For designation of region of medial prefrontal cortex activated any given study: dMPFC indicates dorsal MPFC with z coordinate >10 and including activations in Brodmann Areas 8, 9, 10, and/or dorsal 32, vMPFC indicates ventral MPFC with z = <10 and including activations in BAs 10, 11, 14, 25, and/or ventral 32. ACC indicates anterior cingulate cortex, which includes activations in Brodmann Areas 24 and 32. Judgment types include trait or self-descriptiveness, as in the present study; perspective taking, which includes imagining events from a 1st or 3rd person visuospatial (what do I/they see?) or conceptual (what do I/they think/feel/believe?) perspective; mental state inference, which includes judging the states or traits of depicted individuals; view moving shapes, which refers to viewing clips of moving shapes that tend to elicit spontaneous attributions of intentionality; TOM, which denotes judging vignettes or cartoons explicitly designed to require theory of mind inferences; interactive, which designates games in which participants believe they are playing in real time against or with another participant.

One of these networks, the so called default mode network, has become the primary target in recent investigations to link intrinsic activity to cognition and how intrinsic signal changes may be altered in disease. In this study we assessed functional connectivity within the default mode network during both rest and a continuous working memory task on a region-by-region basis using partial correlation analysis, a data-driven method that provides insight into effective connectivity within neuronal networks. Prominent features of functional connectivity within the default mode network included an overall strong level of interaction between the precuneus/posterior cingulate region and the rest of the default mode network, as well as a high degree of interaction between the left and right medial temporal lobes combined with weak interactions between the medial temporal lobes and the rest of the default mode network. Additionally, we found support for strong interactions between the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and the left inferior parietal lobe as well as between the dorsal and ventral sections of the medial prefrontal cortex. The suggested pivotal role of the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex in the default mode network is discussed.  © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  Intrinsic functional brain connectivity as revealed by lowfrequency spontaneous signal ﬂuctuations in fMRI signal intensity time-courses has received increased attention in the neuroscience community. A ﬁrst demonstration of the existence of so called resting-state networks was given by Biswal et al. (1995) by showing that brain activity in the primary sensorimotor brain areas are synchronized across the hemispheres during rest. Subsequent functional connectivity studies focusing on the detection of low-frequency fMRI signal changes using explorative, data-driven analysis methods have suggested that there exist up to 10 resting-state networks that span long-range cortico-cortical as well as well as cortical– subcortical networks in the human brain (Beckmann et al., 2005; Damoiseaux et al., 2006). Moreover, recent investigations have presented experimental data suggesting that  ⁎ Corresponding author. Fax: +46 8 5177 3266.  E-mail address: Peter.Fransson@ki.se (P.

From a cognitive neuroscience point of view, particular attention has been paid to one of the resting-state networks, the so called default mode network (DMN, Raichle et al., 2001). There are several reasons for this interest, one being that positron emission tomography (PET) investigations have revealed that the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (pC/ PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), both previously shown to be part of the DMN, show an elevated level of metabolic activity (Raichle et al., 2001). Another reason is the recurrent observation that attention-demanding tasks cause a decrease in activity in the DMN (Shulman et al., 1997; Mazoyer et al., 2001). Finally, studies targeting the neuronal basis for self-related mental tasks have shown consistent signal increases in the DMN compared to tasks without elements of self-related mental processing (see Buckner et al., 2008 for a review). From a clinical perspective, the DMN has become a primary objective in the endeavour to characterize and localize differences in resting-state network activity as biological markers for abnormalities in brain connectivity for  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  1179  a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders. For example, previous studies using seed-based ROI correlation analyses have shown that intrinsic fMRI signal ﬂuctuations in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (pC/PCC) is altered in schizophrenia (Bluhm et al., 2007), while intrinsic functional correlation between the pC/PCC, MPFC and the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) is altered in autism (Kennedy and Courchesne, 2008). Moreover, a recent study has shown a signiﬁcant decrease in intrinsic resting-state functional correlation between the MPFC and the PCC in ADHD subjects compared to healthy controls (Castellanos et al., 2008). Using pairwise correlation measures in the healthy brain, Buckner et al. (2008) have obtained results that suggest that the pC/PCC, MPFC and the bilateral IPL together constitute a “core hub” in the DMN. The regions of this “core hub” showed strong intraregional correlation with each other and weaker correlation with the remaining regions in the DMN such as the temporal cortex (TC) and the medial temporal lobe (MTL).  While substantial information has been gained in terms of the spatial location of brain regions that participate in resting-state networks and how these networks are altered during cognitive work and disease (e.g. see Fox and Raichle, 2007; Buckner et al., 2008), less is known of the functional connectivity within the DMN. Investigations that previously have studied default mode activity have typically relied on voxel-based differences in correlation strength calculated on the basis of reference signal intensity time-courses extracted from seed regions of interest (ROIs) positioned in one or several default mode brain areas. Although this approach has been successfully applied to investigate the putative role of the DMN in both health and disease, it provides little information regarding differences in functional interactions at the level of individual brain areas (or equivalently network nodes) in the DMN. In other words, a pairwise correlation analysis of DMN activity does not take into account the covariance structure of the entire DMN and potentially interesting information is lost. Moreover, all seed-based ROI analysis approaches to connectivity investigations are to some extent vulnerable to user-introduced bias in terms of the choices of seed regions made by the investigator.  The goal of the present work was to investigate functional connectivity within the DMN and at the same time addressing the methodological limitations described above. Functional connectivity within the DMN during both rest and a working memory task was assessed in a two-step procedure. First, estimates of regional fMRI signal intensity time-courses in the DMN were extracted based on information contained in statistical maps created by an independent component analysis. Second, functional connectivity within the DMN was assessed using a partial correlation technique that estimates the level of interaction between any two network nodes after removal of the common inﬂuences from all other nodes. The partial correlation analysis showed that the pC/PCC was the only node that exhibited interactions with virtually all other network nodes. The cognitive implications and uses of the observed patterns of interactions within the DMN are discussed.  Materials and methods  The results presented in this study constitute a re-analysis of dataset that has been described previously (Fransson, 2006) using new analytical tools. We here provide basic information  regarding the participants, task and scanning procedures. For a more detailed account, we refer the reader to Fransson (2006).  Subjects and tasks  Seventeen subjects (5 males, age span 22–41 years) participated in this study. No subject had any history of neurological or psychiatric illness. All MR examinations were carried out according to the ethical guidelines and declarations of the Declaration of Helsinki (1975) and the current study was approved by the local ethics committee at the Karolinska University Hospital. All subjects participated in two 10 min echo-planar imaging (EPI), blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) scanning sessions during which they either performed a resting-state task with their eyes ﬁxating on a hair-cross centred on a white black screen or engaged in a continuous verbal 2-back working memory task.  MR image acquisition  All MRI data was acquired on a General Electric Twin-Speed Signa Horizon 1.5 T MRI scanner. Echo-planar imaging (TR/ TE=2000/40 ms, ﬂip=80°, 64 ×64 matrix size, FOV=220 ×220 mm, 29 slices) was used to detect BOLD fMRI signal changes during rest and the working memory task. 300 echo-planar image volumes were acquired for each task.  Image pre-processing  All  image processing was performed using the SPM2 software package (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK, Friston et al., 1995). As a ﬁrst step, functional image time-series were corrected for head motion by realigning all images to the ﬁrst image volume. Second, the mean EPI image for each subject was co-registered to a corresponding T1-weighted high-resolution image volume and subsequently spatially normalized and re-sampled (3×3×3 mm3 voxels) to the approximate Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) as deﬁned by the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) EPI template in SPM2. As a last step, the normalized echo-planar image volumes were spatially ﬁltered using an isotropic Gaussian ﬁlter (6 mm FWHM).  Selection of regions of interest  Previous studies have consistently shown that the dorsal and ventral parts of the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus/ posterior cingulate cortex, lateral parietal cortex, temporal cortex as well as the medial temporal lobe are involved in the default mode network (Buckner et al., 2008). Hence, for our network analysis of DMN activity we chose to extract fMRI signal intensity time-courses from nine brain regions (network nodes): precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (pC/pCC), left and right inferior parietal lobe (lIPL, rIPL), dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, vmPFC), left and right temporal cortex (lTC, rTC) and left and right medial temporal lobes (lMTL, rMTL). A selection of regional DMN activity was accomplished in a three-step procedure. First, an independent component analysis (ICA) of the resting-state data was performed and 60 spatio-temporal independent components were extracted from each individual dataset  1180  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  using the MELODIC FSL software (MELODIC v4.0; FMRIB Oxford University, UK, Beckmann and Smith, 2004). Second, by matching each independent component with a spatial template of the default mode network based on an independent dataset (Fransson, 2005), the spatially bestﬁtting independent component was extracted for each subject as previously described (Greicius et al., 2004, 2007). Third, local estimates of default mode activity in each network region were identiﬁed in terms of voxels exhibiting local Z-score maximum in the best-ﬁtting independent component. To ensure that only the relevant anatomical structures were included, the search for each local maxima was constrained by using the WFU (Wake Forest University) Pickatlas toolbox (Maldjian et al., 2003) together with the AAL (Automatic Anatomical Labelling) atlas (TzourioMazoyer et al., 2002) within SPM. A table of the AAL atlas structures included in the search for each local maximum is given in Supplementary Table 1. Consequently, the exact spatial location for the ROIs was allowed to vary between individuals, although only within the anatomical boundaries detailed in Supplementary Table 1. Although the anatomical constraints were set to be rather liberal, the possibility that they impose a user-introduced bias in the ROI selection process cannot be fully ruled out. An additional constraint was that the individual regions had to be located at least 15 mm apart. Since the distance between the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex was less than 15 mm in three subjects, the data from these three subjects were discarded and the subsequent partial and marginal correlation analysis was based on the remaining fourteen subjects. A representation of DMN activity during rest in the extracted independent components is shown in Fig. 1. Finally, signal intensity time-courses during both rest and the working memory task were extracted using spherical ROIs with a radius of 6 mm. All signal intensity time-courses were bandpass ﬁltered (passband 0.012–0.1 Hz) and orthogonalized with respect to the global mean brain signal. Thus, in each individual, 9 (network regions/nodes)×2 (conditions: rest and working memory) BOLD signal intensity timecourses were extracted, resulting in two datasets per subject pertaining to default mode network activity in the nine network regions. The spatial variability between subjects in the exact anatomical location of ROIs for the ICA-based ROI selection method is shown in the MNI space in Supplementary Figure 1. A quantitative account of the spatial variability between subjects for the ICA-based ROI locations is given in Supplementary Table 2.  Partial correlation analysis  The aim of the present analysis was to address the structure of functional connectivity on a node-by-node basis within the DMN. Typically, investigations regarding effective connectivity for a given functional network in the brain would be approached by using hypothesis-driven data modelling tools such as structural equation modelling (SEM) or dynamic causal modelling (DCM). Both methods are able to provide estimates of effective connectivity provided that detailed knowledge regarding both the structural and functional characteristics of the network exist and can be incorporated into the model. However, hypothesis-driven modelling methods are not easily applicable in this case since information regarding the functional architecture of resting-state networks driven by intrinsic activity is very scarce. Therefore, we have here chosen to use partial correlation analysis, a purely data-driven analysis approach that requires no a priori information and thereby avoiding potential modelling pitfalls in terms of biasing our model of default mode activity by constraints that have weak experimental and/or theoretical support.  In brief, partial correlation analysis of a network composed of R regions consists of computing the conditional correlation between any pair of two regions with respect to the remaining R-2 regions. Hence, partial correlation analysis allows for the removal of mutual dependencies originating from other brain region's common inﬂuences (Marrelec et al., 2006; 2007; Salvador et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2008). In other words, a partial correlation coefﬁcient reﬂects the level of interaction between two regions once the signals of these two regions have been projected onto the subspace orthogonal to the space spanned by the time-courses of all the other regions in the network. As such, this data-driven approach provides access to a measure of interactivity between any two brain regions in a network of arbitrary size that is closer to effective connectivity than marginal correlations (Marrelec et al., 2006, 2007, 2008).  Partial and marginal correlation coefﬁcients between all nine network nodes in the DMN during rest as well as during the working memory task were computed at a group level using a hierarchical model that takes intra- as well as intersubject variability into account. Statistical inference of interaction between any two network nodes was done in a Bayesian framework where a Gibbs sampling scheme was used to estimate the posterior distribution of the group partial correlation matrix. Both marginal and partial correlation coefﬁcients were thresholded at p b0.05 under the null  Fig. 1.

Individual independent components were extracted from each subject and analyzed at a group level using a one-sampled t-test thresholded at p b0.05 (corrected, FDR). Activation maps shown in an axial, sagittal and coronal slice orientation show consistent activity in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobe, medial temporal lobe as well as in the lateral temporal cortex.  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  1181  hypothesis that no interaction between pairs of network nodes exists. A detailed mathematical description of the algorithm and its implementation as outlined here is given in Marrelec et al. (2006).  Results  At a group level, intrinsic activity during rest in the DMN was faithfully represented by the extracted independent component analysis as shown in Fig. 1. Pertinent to our network analysis, consistent activity was found in the pC/PCC, bilateral lateral temporal cortex, MTL, inferior parietal cortex and the dorsal as well as the ventral aspects of the MPFC. Our network modelling results are presented in Fig. 2. Connectivity within the DMN during rest and the continuous verbal 2back task is shown using either marginal or partial correlation as a measure of functional connectivity. A detailed account of the magnitudes for the corresponding correlation coefﬁcients for each individual link is shown in Fig. 3.  As expected, marginal correlation coefﬁcients were signiﬁcantly larger than zero for links between all pairs of network nodes in our model of the default mode. That is, every network node was positively correlated with all the other nodes in the DMN during rest (Fig. 2, upper left panel). However, when correlation between any two nodes was conditioned on all other nodes in the DMN, the partial correlation analysis showed that the pC/pCC region is presumably a central node in the DMN since it was the only region to interact directly with all other regions, with the exception of the right MTL which in turn interacted only with the left MTL (Fig. 2, lower left panel). We also noted the strong degree of interactivity between the pC/pCC and the left inferior parietal cortex as well as the dorsal part of the medial prefrontal cortex (Fig. 2, lower left; Fig. 3, bottom graph). Moreover, it is also of interest to note that while the left and right MTL strongly interacted during rest, their degree of interactivity with the rest of the network nodes was weak. Speciﬁcally, the only signiﬁcant interactions between the medial temporal lobes and the rest of the default mode  network were between the left MTL and the pC/pCC and the left temporal cortex, respectively. In addition, there seems to exist a strong interaction between the dorsal and ventral parts of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) that survives a conditioning with respect to the remaining regions of the default mode network. Finally, the continuous verbal 2-back task seemed to cause a global reduction in functional interactivity within the DMN, although the overall functional structure within the DMN was to a large extent preserved (Fig. 2, lower and upper right panel).  Discussion  In this study, we have presented an investigation to gain insights on how intrinsic activity is routed at the level of individual brain regions in the default mode network. The usage of a data-driven analysis approach allowed us to estimate functional connectivity without making any prior assumptions on how intrinsic activity is implemented within the DMN. Importantly, compared to calculating the pairwise (marginal) correlation coefﬁcients for all brain regions in the DMN, the partial correlation approach provided the means to characterize interactions between any two network nodes in terms that are close to effective connectivity, i.e. the degree to which activity in one brain area modulates activity in another area. In this context, the pC/PCC node is particularly noteworthy, since after conditioning it was the only node in the default mode network that directly interacted with virtually all other nodes. We interpret this observation that the pC/PCC may play a pivotal role in how intrinsic activity is mediated throughout the DMN. This interpretation is in harmony with the notion that the pC/PCC is a key region in the neuronal network that sustains a sense of self-consciousness that is engaged in self-referential mental thoughts during rest. The strong interactivity of the pC/PCC as demonstrated here is also in line with previous neuroimaging studies that have implicated the pC/PCC in a range of cognitive tasks that touches upon various aspects of selfprocessing (for recent reviews see Cavanna and Trimble,  Fig. 2. The upper two panels show in a network graph format the marginal, i.e. pairwise correlation coefﬁcients computed for the nine brain regions (network nodes) in the default mode network during rest (upper left panel) and the continuous working memory task (upper right panel). The correlation strength between any two nodes is colour-coded according to the colour-bar on the right side of the ﬁgure. The lower two panels show the degree of functional interactivity, i.e. the partial correlation coefﬁcients for the nine nodes during both rest (lower left panel) and the working memory task (lower right panel). Only network links that were signiﬁcantly larger than zero (p b0.05) are shown. All network connectivity shown here is based on an independent component analysis approach to extract local changes in intrinsic activity in each network node and subject.  1182  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  Fig. 3. The upper graph shows the magnitude of the marginal correlation coefﬁcients for all 36 links in the nine node model of intrinsic activity in the default mode network. The lower plot shows the magnitude of the corresponding partial correlation coefﬁcients within the default mode network. The coefﬁcients obtained for rest are marked in blue while the corresponding coefﬁcients for the continuous working memory task are marked in red. Similar to the data presented in Fig. 2, all coefﬁcients shown here are computed on signal intensity time-courses extracted by an independent component analysis approach to ﬁnd subject speciﬁc local maxima of intrinsic activity in each network node.  2006; Buckner and Carroll, 2007). Additionally, a pivotal status of the pC/PCC node is also justiﬁed from a metabolic and mechanistic perspective in that previous PET studies have shown that the metabolic activity is higher in the pC/ PCC than all other regions during rest (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001). Moreover, a previous resting-state fMRI study that employed a model including a cosine basis set spanning the frequency interval of interest together with an F-test that tested for the presence of low-frequency signal ﬂuctuations showed a particular strong presence of spontaneous signal changes in pC/PCC and to a somewhat lesser degree in the MPFC and left lateral parietal cortex than in any other region in the DMN (see Fransson, 2005, Fig 3. p. 20). Pertinent to this ﬁnding is also the fact that previous PET studies have shown a reduction in brain metabolism in the pC/PCC in the earliest clinical and pre-clinical phases of Alzheimer's disease (Minoshima et al., 1997). Moreover, recent resting-state fMRI studies of DMN activity in patients diagnosed to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease have revealed regionally speciﬁc reductions in coherence of low-frequency signal ﬂuctuations in the precuneus (He et al., 2007). Additionally, a recent fMRI study has demonstrated reduced functional connectivity between the precuneus/PCC and the MTL in patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment, a  syndrome of high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (Sorg et al., 2007).  The strong interaction between the dorsal and ventral parts of the MPFC during both rest and working memory was preserved in the partial correlation analysis. This ﬁnding is perhaps not overly surprising since the functional border between the two is not clear-cut from an intrinsic activity perspective. Although local maxima of intrinsic activity located speciﬁcally in either part have been reported (Greicius et al., 2003; Fransson, 2005; Fox et al., 2005), intrinsic activity in the MPFC is often observed as a contiguous cluster of activity that spans the MPFC along its entire dorsal–ventral extension (Fransson, 2005; Fox et al., 2005). This observation is also reﬂected by the fact that the data from 3 subjects were discarded from the network analysis due to a close proximity (less than 15 mm) of local maxima in resting-state activity in the dorsal and ventral MPFC. Similarly, the strong interaction across hemispheres for the MTLs during both rest and the working memory task is noteworthy. This ﬁnding together with the observation that the interaction between the bilateral MTLs and the remaining DMN were rather weak suggests that intrinsic activity in the medial temporal lobes operates, at least in part, independently from the rest of the DMN. It should also be mentioned that this view on the role of  P. Fransson, G. Marrelec / NeuroImage 42 (2008) 1178–1184  1183  the MTL in the default mode network is not in conﬂict with a previously published study on the MTL and intrinsic activity since pairwise marginal correlation was used as a measure of functional connectivity in that study (Vincent et al., 2006). Additionally, the partial correlation analysis suggests a tendency for slightly stronger interactions in the left compared to the right hemisphere. For example, the left temporal cortex was the only region to interact with the MTL and the left inferior parietal lobe region was signiﬁcantly interactive with both the dorsal and ventral parts of the MPFC.  The overall preserved structure of functional interactivity during the working memory task (Fig. 2 upper and lower right panels) is in agreement with previous seed-based ROI marginal correlation analyses (Fransson, 2006). The persistence of intrinsic activity in the DMN during a continuous verbal 2-back working memory task, a task that provides very little time to conscious, non-task related self-referential thinking, further supports the idea that intrinsic activity in the DMN is not caused exclusively by spontaneous changes in conscious thought. This line of reasoning is further reinforced by recent studies that have shown that DMN activity is preserved during early stages of sleep (Fukunaga et al., 2006; Horovitz et al., 2008) as well as during anaesthesia (Vincent et al., 2007). Pertinent to our results, it is interesting to note that a recent study observed a speciﬁc effect in terms of reduced intrinsic activity in the pC/PCC region during conscious sedation by means of administration of midazolam (Greicius et al., in press). The hypothesis that behaviour contributes to spontaneous activity in resting-state networks was recently addressed in a recent study by Fox et al. that observed a correlation between button press force and spontaneous trialto-trial variability in the left somatomotor cortex (Fox et al., 2007). Although the neuronal mechanism that causes spontaneous low-frequency signal changes is currently unknown, we interpret the experimental data and results presented so far that conscious as well as unconscious neuronal processes may contribute to intrinsic brain activity (see also Fransson, 2006).  One of the previously proposed functional roles of the DMN is that it supports an ability to perform internal mentation in the sense that the DMN provides a platform for putting together dynamic mental scenarios that are largely detached from the external world (Buckner and Carroll, 2007). Typically, these scenarios would contain elements of auto-biographical episodic memory, self-related prospective thoughts, moral judgments as well as evaluations of other persons' intentions (theory-of-mind). Further, it has been suggested that the purpose for a continuously on-going internal mentation process is to act as a simulator and predictor of future events that builds upon previous experiences. With this hypothesis in mind, it has been noted that previous task-driven neuroimaging studies support the idea that the default mode network can be divided into two subsystems (Buckner et al., 2008). On one hand, previous studies have shown that the posterior part of the DMN including the pC/PCC, bilateral IPL and the MTL region are activated in episodic memory retrieval (e.g. Wagner et al., 2005). Moreover, it has recently been shown that this subsystem is synchronized through spontaneous signal changes (Vincent et al., 2006). On the other hand, tasks that involve self-referential mental thoughts typically activate the anterior part of the DMN and the pC/PCC (Gusnard et al., 2001). Since the process of simulating future events to a large extent engages the same neuronal circuits as remembering  past events (e.g. see recent review by Schacter et al., 2008), it is plausible to assume that a neuronal platform for internal mentation as described above would require an interaction between the two subsystems (Buckner et al., 2008). Then, the strong interconnectivity between the pC/PCC node and the rest of the DMN as revealed by the partial correlation network analysis adds further support for the hypothesis that the pC/ PCC node in the DMN acts as a convergence node where information processing in the two subsystems is integrated. It could be argued that a more ﬁne-grained model of DMN activity is warranted and that the nine network nodes selected here are unnecessarily limited in scope. For example, it is plausible that the parahippocampal gyrus and the hippocampus may serve different functions within the DMN and thus should be represented as separate network nodes. To address this concern, we initially tried to locate separate maxima of intrinsic activity by performing individual searches in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus as anatomically delineated in the AAL atlas. However, in the majority of subjects, the distance between local maxima in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus was less than 12 mm, which would make an interpretation of separate contributions for these regions in relation to functional interactivity dubious. Since our results suggests the ICA-based approach is less biased while at the same time providing good sensitivity to local changes in intrinsic activity, we here refrained from further reﬁnements of our network model. A separation of parahippocampal versus hippocampus intrinsic activity would most likely require a considerably higher spatial resolution in the raw functional MR images than used here. It should also be stressed that while partial correlation analysis provides estimates of functional interactions it does not give information regarding causality (Marrelec et al., 2006).  In sum, using a novel approach to extract local changes in intrinsic activity combined with a data-driven analysis approach, we have presented a ﬁrst assessment of functional connectivity on a node-by-node basis within the DMN. A prominent ﬁnding included a putative pivotal role for the pC/ PCC in the default mode network. In this context, changes in intrinsic brain activity speciﬁc to developmental (Fransson et al., 2007; Fair et al., 2008), aging (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2007; Damoiseaux et al., 2007) as well as disease-related mechanisms (e.g. Garrity et al., 2007; Castellanos et al., 2008) have recently been reported (for recent reviews see Buckner et al., 2008 and Fox and Raichle, 2007). We suggest that the results presented here can serve as a template for informed modelling approaches in a network framework to map and characterize changes in DMN intrinsic activity in both health and disease.

However, it is so far inconclusive whether brain regions known to represent reward values are involved in the generation of optimistically biased belief updates. To address this question, we investigated neural correlates of belief updates that result in relatively better future outlooks, and therefore imply a positive subjective value of the judgment outcome. Participants estimated the probability of experiencing different adverse future events. After being provided with population base rates of these events, they had the opportunity to update their initial estimates. Participants made judgments concerning themselves or a similar other, and were confronted with desirable or undesirable base rates (i.e., lower or higher than their initial estimates). Belief updates were smaller following undesirable than desirable information, and this optimism bias was stronger for judgments regarding oneself than others. During updating, the positive value of self-related updates was reﬂected by neural activity in the subgenual ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that increased both with increasing sizes of favorable updates, and with decreasing sizes of unfavorable updates. During the processing of self-related undesirable base rates, increasing activity in a network including the dorsomedial PFC, hippocampus, thalamus and ventral striatum predicted decreasing update sizes. Thus, key regions of the neural reward circuitry contributed to the generation of optimistically biased selfreferential belief updates. While the vmPFC tracked subjective values of belief updates, a network including the ventral striatum was involved in neglecting information calling for unfavorable updates.  © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  Thinking about the future is part of a person's identity and supports action planning, decision-making and emotion regulation (Carver and Scheier, 2014; D'Argembeau et al., 2012, 2009). However, this highly inﬂuential prospective thinking does not provide us with the most realistic future outlook, but is instead prevalently optimistically biased. Cross-culturally and independent of gender and age, people tend to overestimate the likelihood of positive future outcomes, and to underestimate the likelihood of negative ones in various domains of daily life, including health-related issues, social relations, and professional success (Chowdhury et al., 2014; Leary, 2007; Sharot et al., 2012, 2011; Shepperd et al., 2002, 2013; Weinstein and Klein, 1996).

Kuzmanovic).  consequences of optimistically distorted judgments can be positive or negative: Overestimated chances of success may lead to positive feelings and an increase of effort with beneﬁcial effects for the individual and its environment, but may also lead to miscalculations and failures.  It has been assumed that both motivational and cognitive factors contribute to the optimistic bias, and this reciprocal inﬂuence has also been more generally described as “motivated cognition” (Hughes and Zaki, 2015). Cognitive explanations focus on how people achieve desired end states of judgments, and refer to selective memory search and conclusions that are biased toward retrieving conﬁrmatory information for rewarding beliefs (Shepperd et al., 2002). Motivational explanations, on the other hand, relate to the pleasure of having favorable beliefs regarding oneself and one's own future, and the resulting desire to adopt such optimistic beliefs (Shepperd et al., 2002). Accordingly, optimism bias has been described as “a motivation to adopt the most rewarding (or least aversive) perspective on future outcomes” (Sharot et al., 2011).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.02.014 1053-8119/© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  152  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  However, a previous neuroimaging research on optimism bias reported solely the recruitment of brain regions related to complex cognitive processing, i.e., the inferior and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Sharot et al., 2011). Thus, there is still a lack of evidence for the motivational explanations, which would require a demonstration of recruitment of key structures of the neural reward circuit. While this complex network includes several cortical and subcortical regions, the most prominent structures involved in human value processing are the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the ventral striatum (vStr) (Bartra et al., 2013; Clithero and Rangel, 2014; Haber and Knutson, 2010; Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Peters and Buchel, 2010). The vmPFC, and particularly its subgenual part, has robustly been shown to play a critical role in representing the positive subjective value of rewards and emotional stimuli (Chase et al., 2015; Levy and Glimcher, 2012). While the vStr has traditionally been related to learning from errors in reward prediction, more recent research supports an integrative view involving both learning and motivational functions (Bartra et al., 2013; Hamid et al., 2016). More speciﬁcally, dopaminergic signaling in vStr has been shown to represent values of estimated future rewards, which inﬂuence decisions whether to invest effort in actions aiming at these reward states (Hamid et al., 2016).  The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that favorable beliefs recruit the same brain regions known to be associated with external rewards, to support the view that they have internal positive subjective values able to guide judgment and decision processes. We employed a revised version of an fMRI belief update paradigm. The paradigm assesses how people update their initial beliefs about risks of experiencing hazards when they are provided with base rates for these hazards that result in estimation errors (i.e., the difference between the subject's ﬁrst risk estimation and the presented base rates). It could be shown that updating was optimistically biased because it was larger after desirable new information (lower risk than initially expected) than after undesirable information (higher risk than initially expected) (Sharot et al., 2011). These results contradict formal learning principles as these predict balanced updating in response to errors, independent of the desirability of the new information.  The ﬁrst revision was to extend the study design in order to differentiate between judgments referring to oneself and others. Second, in order to increase the experimental control and precision, we systematically manipulated the presented base rates, and included both the ﬁrst and the second estimations (before and after the presentation of the base rate) in one single trial. And third, we modiﬁed the analyses to allow the identiﬁcation of neural regions that track ﬂuctuations of updates on a trial-by-trial level (in contrast to tracking estimation errors as in Sharot et al., 2011), because belief updates represent the end state of the judgment process and are expected to have a speciﬁc subjective value for judging persons.  We hypothesized that the vmPFC would reﬂect the differential subjective value of varying update sizes that result in better or worse future outlooks relative to participants' initial beliefs, particularly for self-referential judgments. The larger an update toward an unexpectedly low average risk, the better is the subject's adjusted future outlook. Thus, increasing updates after favorable new information are expected to have increasing positive value and to be accompanied by an increasing vmPFC activity. In contrast, the greater an update toward an unexpectedly high average risk, the worse is the updated subject's future outlook, so that decreasing updates in this condition are expected to result in an increasing positive value and increasing vmPFC activity.  Furthermore, we explored in which brain regions the activity during the reception of the new information (base rates) predicted subsequent updates. The belief reconstruction initiated at this point may encompass cognitive processes such as memory retrieval or inferences, but may also be modulated by the motivation to adopt the most favorable conclusions (Shepperd et al., 2002), particularly when these are selfrelevant and unfavorable (Sharot et al., 2011). Finally, we explored the  relationships between the optimism bias in belief updating and trait optimism.  Material and methods  Participants  A total of 36 right-handed individuals with no reported history of neurological or psychiatric illness were recruited online within the Research Center Juelich, Germany, and participated in the fMRI study. Twelve persons were excluded from the analyses. Five persons had excessive head movements (outliers were selected by total movement greater than 3 mm or scan-to-scan motion greater than 1.5 mm, as assessed by ArtRepair Software; Mazaika et al., 2005), probably due to a relatively tight head coil used in the study; the logﬁles of one person were overwritten; one person suspected that the base rates were not correct; two persons had insufﬁcient German language skills as they did not know the meaning of a high number of stimulus events (18 and 24 events). The remaining three persons had a mean positive estimation error of less than 7, because of the frequent low ﬁst estimates (see S.1). Thus, data from 24 participants were included in the analyses (mean age = 25.13 years, SD = 3.89, ranging from 19 to 38; 13 females). All the participants were naïve with respect to the speciﬁc purpose of the study, gave written informed consent and were paid for their participation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne, Germany.  Stimulus material  We used 88 short German descriptions of adverse life events as stimuli and included a wide range of events relating to different life domains (e.g., dementia, arthritis, unemployment, or pest infestation in the home; see Kuzmanovic et al., 2015 for the complete list). The assignment of the stimuli to the experimental conditions and the order of trials were randomized anew for each participant. Note that by applying a random assignment of the stimuli to the experimental conditions, event characteristics that have been suggested to modulate the optimism bias (e.g., base rate, event valence, arousal, controllability, personal experience) (Rose et al., 2008; Sharot et al., 2007; Weinstein, 1980, 1987), or general stimulus characteristics (e.g., number of words or letters) were equally distributed across the experimental conditions, and thus do not constitute confounding variables (see also Kuzmanovic et al., 2015).  Design and procedure  In each trial of the update experiment, the participants ﬁrst had to estimate the probability that different adverse events would occur at least once in a lifetime. Next, they were presented with a corresponding base rate for the general population, and were then given the opportunity to adjust their initial estimate (see Fig. 1 for illustration and durations of events). The intervals within the trial (“jitter 4 s” in Fig. 1) and between the trials randomly varied, resulting in mean durations of 4000 ms and 6000 ms, respectively (within-trial durations varied between 2875 ms and 5125 ms, between-trial durations between 4875 ms and 7125 ms). The successive arrangement of i) the ﬁrst estimation, ii) the presentation of the base rate and iii) the second estimation (including the display of the initial estimate) within one trial represent a substantial modiﬁcation of the original paradigm (Sharot et al., 2011) and served the purpose of minimizing confounding memory effects.  The factors that were expected to affect the update behavior within the task were the target person of the judgment (self, other), the valence of the new information (positive, negative), and the participants' trait optimism scoring (high, low). In contrast to the original paradigm that included self-related judgments only (Sharot et al.,  B.

Example trials of the update experiment. At the beginning of each trial the target person of the judgment was indicated, i.e., self or other. Next, an adverse event was displayed and the participants had to estimate the probability of experiencing it at least once in their (or other's) lifetime. Then, the base rate of the respective event in the general population was presented. Finally, the participants had the opportunity to update their initial estimate. Unbeknown to the participants, the valence of the presented base rate was experimentally manipulated by subtracting or adding varying values from the participants' ﬁrst estimate. Upper row: An example of a desirable (i.e., positive) base rate that was generated by subtracting 10 from the ﬁrst estimate given. Lower row: An equivalent example of an undesirable (i.e., negative) base rate that was generated by adding 10 to the ﬁrst estimate given. The exact time course of the trials is shown at the bottom.  2011), the target person to whom the probabilities had to be ascribed was manipulated by instructing the participants to make estimations for themselves in half of the trials (self), or for a similar other person of the same age, sex and socioeconomic background in the other half of the trials (other). The valence of the new information referring to the base rates of adverse events depended on the participants' initial rating in each trial: When the base rate for an adverse event was lower than the participants' ﬁrst estimate, then this constituted desirable or positive (p) information; when it was higher than the ﬁrst estimate, then this constituted undesirable or negative (n) information. The participants' trait optimism was measured by the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R, Glaesmer et al., 2008). The LOT-R median of the whole sample was used to generate two subsamples (median = 17; see Table 2): low trait optimism (low_to, n = 13) and high trait optimism subsample (high_to, n = 11). Thus, a 2 × 2 × 2 design was realized with the factors target (self vs. other) and valence (p vs. n), resulting in four withinsubject conditions self_p, self_n, other_p and other_n, and the between-subject factor group (low_to vs. high_to).  The participants were told that the experiment aims to investigate the neural substrates of expectations toward future life events. They were instructed that there was no right or wrong answer as we were interested in their subjective judgment, and to feel free to update their ﬁrst estimate as much as they wanted. They were also informed that the population base rates were determined by the German Federal Statistical Ofﬁce (“Statistisches Bundesamt”), and that they should consider this information during their second estimation.  Unbeknown to the participants, the base rates were in fact systematically manipulated in order to control for frequencies and distributions of positive and negative trials, which was the third modiﬁcation of the original paradigm (Sharot et al., 2011). The positive and negative base rates were computed by subtracting or adding varying values from the ﬁrst estimate (ranging from 1 to 25; see Fig. 1 for an example; see S.1 for more details). In a ﬁnal debrieﬁng, the participants were informed that they had been deceived about the source of population base rates, and the methodological reasons for this procedure were explained.  In addition, the participants were instructed to abstain from responding to events for which they felt unable to make a proper estimation. For instance, this could apply to events that the participants were experiencing at the time of participation (e.g., currently suffering  from hay fever), or that they had never heard about (e.g., unfamiliar diseases).  The responses were given by selecting an absolute probability number with a possible range from 1% to 99% in a completely continuous manner by using three response buttons. The participants always used both hands, in one session the right hand for selecting the percentage number and the left hand for conﬁrming it, and in the other session the other way around (order counter-balanced across participants). The number currently displayed on the screen could be decreased by pressing the left button (e.g., index ﬁnger of the right hand), and increased by pressing the right button (e.g., middle ﬁnger of the right hand). As soon as the desired number appeared, the participants could give a ﬁnal conﬁrmation of their response by pressing the conﬁrmation button (little ﬁnger of the other hand). For all ﬁrst estimations, the number initially displayed was 50%, and for all second estimations the number corresponded to the selected ﬁrst estimate (see Fig. 1). The participants were instructed to answer within 6 s. If the answer was not recorded within this time, a second and last response period of 6 s was presented. In the event that the ﬁrst estimate was not provided, the rest of the trial was omitted. The mean durations of the two task sessions were 22.46 min (SD = 1.43) and 21.83 min (SD = 1.16), respectively.  After the fMRI acquisition, the participants completed a short debrieﬁng including ratings of task difﬁculty, and had the opportunity to describe problems or hypotheses regarding the purpose of the task. Importantly, because we manipulated the base rates, we took great care to assess the participants' suspicions regarding their plausibility by using the funnel debrieﬁng method (for more details see Kuzmanovic et al., 2015). Furthermore, they rated their personal experience for each stimulus event that they had seen in the update experiment on a 7-point scale (from 1 = unfamiliar to 7 = currently experiencing). The personal experience ratings were carried out on a laptop with the software Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Version 15.1). Prior to both the update experiment and the personal experience ratings, the participants underwent a standardized, computerized instruction including practice trials with stimuli not used within the experimental tasks. Finally, self-report questionnaires (German versions) were completed to measure relevant characteristics of the sample: LOT-R assessing trait optimism on a scale from 0 (pessimistic) to 24 (optimistic), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck and Steer, 1987)  154  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  assessing symptoms of depression on a scale from 0 (minimal) to 63 (maximal).  The MRI data were acquired by using a Magnetom Trio 3T whole body scanner and a 32-channel head coil (Siemens AG, Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). fMRI data during the update experiment were acquired in two sessions with a T2*-weighted gradient echo planar imaging sequence [TR = 2200 ms, TE = 30 ms, ﬁeld of view = 210 × 210 mm2, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm3, 33 oblique (maximal 30°) axial slices]. Three additional volumes were collected and discarded at the beginning of each session to allow for magnetic saturation. In addition, we acquired high-resolution T1- weighted MPRAGE images (TR = 2250 ms, TE = 3.93 ms, ﬁeld of view = 256 × 256 mm2, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3, 128 sagittal images), as well as DTI images (related analyses not reported here). Stimuli and response displays were presented and recorded by the software package Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Version 15.1), and projected onto a screen at the end of the magnet bore that the participants viewed via a mirror mounted on the head coil. The responses were assessed using an MR-compatible LUMItouch keypad (Photon Control Inc., Burnaby, BC, Canada).  Measures  The critical measure of the participants' behavior was the size of updates after being confronted with the base rates of future life events. For each participant, the difference between the ﬁrst and the second estimate was computed in each of the 88 trials, and then the mean updates were computed separately for each of the four experimental conditions (self_p, self_n, other_p and other_n) by averaging all trialbased updates within each condition. Thus, every participant ended up with four repeated-measures of mean updates. If present, trials with missing responses (M = 1.38, SD = 2.00) and trials with estimation error of zero (M = 3.38, SD = 4.20; e.g., when the participant's ﬁrst estimate was 1%, no errors can be generated to provide desirable base rates, i.e., rates lower than the ﬁrst estimate; see S.1 for more details) were excluded before computing the mean updates. We used signed update values, but with a differential procedure for lower (positive) and higher (negative) base rates. In conditions self_p and other_p, updates in each trial were computed as ﬁrst estimate minus second estimate, because the presented base rate was lower than the ﬁrst estimate and second estimates were expected to be adjusted to this smaller value. Conversely, in conditions self_n and other_n, updates were computed as second estimate minus ﬁrst estimate. Thus, in the majority of trials independent of condition, updates were equal to or greater than zero (see also Table 1 and Fig. 2 for mean values; mean number of zero updates = 20.29, SD = 10.34). For trials in which the participants responded in an unexpected direction (e.g., ﬁrst estimate = 20%, base rate = 10%, second estimate = 25%), the update was a negative value (M = 1.63, SD = 1.69).  Additionally, in order to obtain inter-individual measures of the optimism bias, we computed the difference between the mean update for positive and negative trials, separately for self and other, for each participant. The self-speciﬁc optimism bias (biasself) was computed as mean updateself_p − mean updateself_n, and the other-related optimism bias (biasother) was computed as mean updateother_p − mean updateother_n. Positive values indicate an optimism bias as they result from larger mean updates after desirable than undesirable new information. Finally, a differential optimism bias (biasself_other) was computed as biasself − biasother. Here, a positive value indicates a greater self-related than other-related optimism bias. In addition, we computed the difference between the mean ﬁrst estimates (1stE) relating to self and other (1stEself_other): mean 1stEself − mean 1stEother. The difference in initial risk estimates for adverse future events represents a classical measure for the ‘comparative optimism’ beyond update paradigms (Shepperd et al., 2002). These bias measures, biasself, biasother,  Table 1 Effects of target person and valence of new information on update behavior in the overall sample and in the sub-samples with low and high trait optimism.

Statistical analyses  Behavioral data  All behavioral analyses were conducted by using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 2.0). In order to test for an optimism bias in belief updating under consideration of the participants' trait optimism, we conducted a mixed ANOVA with two within-subject factors target (self vs. other) and valence (positive vs. negative), one between-subject factor trait optimism (low_to vs. high_to), and the dependent variable mean update (general linear model, repeated-measure design). In addition, in order to better characterize the effect of trait optimism, two repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted with target and valence as within-subject factors, separately for the two groups of participants with low and high trait optimism, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient, r, was used as an effect size measure (all F-values had 1 degree of freedom).  In order to test for relationships between the individual measures of the optimism bias (biasself, biasother, biasself_other, 1stEself_other), trait optimism (LOT-R) and depression symptoms (BDI), Pearson's correlation coefﬁcients (r) were calculated. We expected that biasself, biasself_other and 1stEself_other would relate positively to each other and to LOT-R, and negatively to BDI corresponding to reduced optimism in depression (Korn et al., 2014; Scheier et al., 1994; Strunk and Adler, 2009; Strunk et al., 2006), thus one-tailed tests were applied. We did not have any hypotheses about the relationship between biasother and these scores, so we applied two-tailed tests here. The alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests.  B.

Behavioral results of the belief update experiment. A) The overall sample shows the expected interaction between the target person and the valence of base rates: Participants generally tended to update less after undesirable (negative) new information, and this tendency was greater for self-related than for other-related judgments indicating an optimism bias. B) High and low scorings on trait optimism were associated with a differential pattern of the update behavior. The self-protective optimism bias was strongly pronounced in participants scoring high on trait optimism (right), but absent in participants scoring low on trait optimism (left). Error bars show 95% CI * p b .05.  fMRI data  The fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using MATLAB 7.9 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) and statistical parametric mapping software package (SPM8, Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK). The EPI images were corrected for head movements using realignment and unwarping, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute reference space using the uniﬁed segmentation function, resampled to 2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm voxels, and spatially smoothed with an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Two separate analyses were conducted: i) a linear parametric modulation of the neural activity during the 2nd estimation by update, and, ii) a linear parametric modulation of the neural activity during the presentation of base rates by update (see S.6 for an illustration and more details). The ﬁrst analysis aimed to identify brain regions where the activity during belief updating correlated with the size of the update, and the second analysis explored whether there were brain regions, in which the activity during the confrontation with disconﬁrming new information correlated with – and thus predicted – subsequent update sizes. At the single-subject level, the conditions were modeled using a boxcar reference vector convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and its time derivative. Events relating to ﬁrst estimation (duration 3 s, including target instruction), base rates (duration 2 s) and second estimation (duration 2 s) were separately modeled for the different experimental conditions (see Fig. 1 and Fig. S.1). Button presses indicating the ﬁrst and the second estimate were modeled on separate regressors (duration from the onset of the response event to the last button press). Trials with missing responses, and trials with estimation error of zero, if present, were modeled on a separate regressor. Movement parameters were included as multiple regressors of no interest. Low-frequency signal drifts were ﬁltered using a cutoff of 128 s. Fourteen contrast images were computed relative to the implicit baseline (i.e., weighting a single regressor of interest with 1 in both sessions and the rest of regressors with 0) and used for grouplevel models: 1st estimation: self and other; base rate: self_p, self_n, other_p, and other_n; 2nd estimation: self_p, self_p_PM (PM, parametric modulation by update) self_n, self_n_PM, other_p, other_p_PM, other_n, and other_n_PM. In the second analysis applying PM to the average BOLD response to base rates, PM-contrasts referred to base rate presentations and not to 2nd estimations (see Fig. S.1).  At the group level, for each of two abovementioned analyses, a ﬂexible factorial design with factors ‘condition’ and ‘subject’ was conducted. The threshold for signiﬁcance was set to p b .05, familywise error (FWE) — corrected at the voxel level for the whole brain with an extent threshold of 10 voxels. Because the main interest concerned neural correlates of varying update sizes, we report all signiﬁcant results relating to whole brain parametric modulation effects from both analyses. In order to explore whether there are differences in the BOLD response pattern between the low_to and the high_to  participants, beta values were extracted for all signiﬁcant cluster maxima and compared between the subsamples using a t-test (p b .05, not corrected for multiple comparisons). For completeness, we also report whole brain main effects relating to average BOLD responses, i.e., independent of parametric modulation by update (see S.7). Furthermore, we also report and brieﬂy discuss the behavioral and neural results relating to estimation errors (see S.4, S.8, S.10). Activations were displayed on sections of the mean normalized T1 image of the overall sample. Anatomical labels were assigned using the Anatomy toolbox (Amunts et al., 2007; Eickhoff et al., 2005).  Results  Behavioral data  Differential updating dependent on target, valence and trait optimism  The behavioral results of the mixed ANOVA show that there was a signiﬁcant interaction between target and valence: The participants updated less in response to undesirable than to desirable base rates, and this effect was stronger for self-related than for other-related judgments (see Table 1 and Fig. 2A). However, there was a signiﬁcant three-way interaction indicating that the groups with low and high trait optimism demonstrated different update behavior patterns. The additional two ANOVAs (separately conducted for the low_to and high_to subsamples) revealed that the target × valence interaction was signiﬁcant only in the high_to group, but not in the low_to group (see Table 1 and Fig. 2B). Thus, only the group with high trait optimism showed a signiﬁcant self-speciﬁc optimism bias. The pattern of the update behavior in the high_to group can also be described as a selectively decreased update behavior during self_n (self_n vs. self_p see Table 1; ps b .01 for self_n vs. other_p and self_n vs. other_n), relative to all other conditions with a comparably high update level (all ps N .05 for self_p vs. other_p, self_p vs. other_n, and other_p vs. other_n).  The reported ANOVA results could be replicated when using update values standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 within each subject taking into account inter-individual differences in the mean tendency to update initial estimates (group × target × valence interaction: p = .001; see S.4 for more details). In addition, conﬁrming the differential updating pattern between subsamples scoring high and low on trait optimism, an ANCOVA based on the overall sample and including target person and valence as within-subject factors and LOT-R scores as a covariate revealed a signiﬁcant three-way interaction target × valence × LOT-R, F(1,22) = 5.75, p = .025.  Other task-related variables, including ﬁrst and second estimates, base rates and estimation errors differed signiﬁcantly across the four conditions [Fs(3,69) N 16, ps b .001], which was partly forced by the experimental design (for descriptive statistics and detailed explanations see S.3 and S.1). For instance, it is to be expected that base rates in the  156  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  positive condition are lower than in the negative condition because they were generated by subtracting values from the participants' ﬁrst estimates, while negative base rates were computed by adding values to the ﬁrst estimates. Importantly, however, none of these variables had a signiﬁcant relationship to update sizes (ﬁrst estimate, r = .12, p = .229; second estimate, r = −.01, p = .998; base rate, r = −.19, p = .066; estimation error, r = −.15, p = .159; not corrected for multiple comparisons), and the ANOVA effects of target person, valence and trait optimism on update remained signiﬁcant even after controlling for these variables (ps b .05; see S.5 for more details).  Relationships between bias measures and questionnaire scores  The individual bias values as well as the trait optimism and BDI scores are presented in Table 2. The correlation analysis revealed that both biasself and biasself_other were positively related to trait optimism (biasself: r = .35, p = .046; biasself_other: r = .46, p = .013), and inversely related to depression symptoms (biasself: r = −.42, p = .020; biasself_other: r = −.50, p = .007). There was no signiﬁcant correlation between biasother and trait optimism (r = −.15, p = .475) or depression symptoms (r = .12, p = .574). In addition, 1stEself_other did not correlate with trait optimism (r = .03, p = .447), depression symptoms (r = −.04, p = .436), nor biasother (r = .10, p = .656). However, there was a correlation between 1stEself_other and biasself (r = −.36, p = .042), and 1stEself_other and biasself_other (r = −.42, p = .021). Furthermore, there was a strong inverse correlation between the trait optimism and depression symptoms (r = −.67, p = .000).  Post-experimental assessments  The analysis of the ratings of personal experience with stimulus events revealed that the stimulus events were equally familiar within the four experimental conditions [F(3,69) = 1.76, p = .163; overall: M = 3.00, SD = 0.36], and that the participants indeed followed the instruction not to respond to events that they were experiencing at the time of the experiment. The examination of the short postexperiment debrieﬁng revealed that the task was not too difﬁcult, and that none of the participants who were included in the analyses were aware of the task purpose, namely, investigating the optimism bias as indicated by larger updates after desirable than after undesirable new information, in particular for self-related judgments. The participants reported that some base rates appeared surprisingly low or high, but that they attributed this to the fact that the probabilities related to the whole population and to the entire lifetime. None of the participants included in the analyses doubted the authenticity of the base rates. In fact, even after being informed about the task purpose and the manipulation of the base rates at the end of the experiment, none of the included participants declared that they were aware of either of these.  fMRI data  fMRI analyses aimed to identify brain regions in which the activity correlated with the size of updates on a trial-by-trial level, i.e., targeting within-subject effects. For the complete list of results relating to the parametric modulation by updates see Table 3.  Neural correlates of updates during second estimation  There was a signiﬁcant difference between regression slopes for self_p and self_n in the vmPFC. The beta estimates in Fig. 3 show that the correlation was positive for self_p, but negative for self_n. That means that when making self-referential judgments, the activity in the vmPFC was greater the larger the desirable updates, and it was also greater the smaller the undesirable updates. This effect also remained signiﬁcant when conducting a paired t-test at the second level of analysis directly comparing the parametric regressors relating to self_p and self_n, respectively (T = 4.33, puncorr = .001, peak at 0/ 34/−14, cluster size 36), however at a less stringent signiﬁcance threshold. In addition, when repeating the same analysis, but with within-subject standardized update values instead of row update values, the self_p N self_n effect in the vmPFC was replicated (T = 5.51, pFWE-corr = .003, peak at −2/36/−10, cluster size 50).  No comparable effect was present for other-related judgments (other_p N other_n). Moreover, the interaction effect [(self_p N self_n) N (other_p N other_n)] yielded a large activation in the vmPFC (maximum peak at 14/42/−4, T = 5.17, size = 1621 voxels), including a peak at −6/34/−6 (T = 3.95), however at a more liberal threshold (pFWE-corrs b .05 at the cluster level, with p b .001 at the voxel level). This interaction conﬁrms that the difference in regression slopes for positive and negative base rates was indeed speciﬁc for self-related judgments.  Neural correlates of updates during base rate presentation  In self-trials with undesirable base rates (self_n), there was an inverse correlation between the BOLD response to base rates and updates in a network including the thalamus, the fusiform gyrus extending into the hippocampus, occipital areas, vStr and the dmPFC (see Table 3B and Fig. 4). Thus, during the reception of undesirable self-related base rates, the activity in these regions was greater the lower the size of subsequent updates.  The reported self_n effect also remained signiﬁcant in the majority of the identiﬁed regions when conducting a one sample t-test at the second level of analysis including the parametric regressor relating to self_n (dmPFC, thalamus, lingual gyrus, vStr; puncorrs N .002, Ts N 3.3), however at a less stringent signiﬁcance threshold.

No comparable effect was present for other-related judgments (other_n, inverse correlation). Moreover, the direct comparison (other_n N self_n) yielded the same network as the inverse self_n contrast alone, however at a more liberal threshold (puncorrs b .001, Ts N 3.7). This comparison indicates that the increasing activation of the described network with decreasing subsequent updates during the processing of negative base rates was indeed speciﬁc for self-related judgments.  Control variables  In order to examine whether the update-related effects might be related to the size of the presented base rates, or to the size of estimation errors, we computed the supplementary analyses with parametric modulation by base rates and estimation errors, respectively, instead of updates (see Tables S.4 and S.5). Relative to the main results of parametric modulation by updates reported in the “Neural correlates of updates during the second estimation” section and in the “Neural correlates of updates during the reception of base rates” section, these  158  B.

Activity in the subgenual ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during self-related belief updating reﬂected the subjective value of belief updates. The direct comparison between self-trials with positive and negative base rates revealed a differential within-subject correlation between the activity in the vmPFC and the size of belief updates. After positive base rates (self_p) there was a positive correlation between the BOLD response and the size of updates: The larger the updates, the stronger the BOLD response. Conversely, after negative base rates (self_n) there was an inverse correlation between the BOLD response and the size of updates: The smaller the update, the stronger the BOLD response. This activation pattern reﬂects the subjective value of updating: Both large updates leading to an improvement of future outlooks relative to the initial belief, and small updates (or refraining from updating) toward worse future outlooks are expected to have a positive subjective value, and were accompanied by an increased BOLD response in the vmPFC. Error bars show 90% CI.  analyses revealed no similarities or overlaps, indicating that the updaterelated effects cannot be accounted for by the inﬂuence of the base rates or estimation errors.  Moreover, because of the correlation between updates and estimation errors (see Table S.1), we examined more closely whether the differential BOLD signals reported in the “Neural correlates of updates during the second estimation” section and in the “Neural correlates of updates during the reception of base rates” section were better accounted for by updates than by estimation errors. For each phase of the trial (second estimation and base rate presentation), we computed two separate ﬁrst level models (Wood et al., 2008). One model included updates as parametric modulators, and the other model included estimation errors as parametric modulators. In order to scale the estimated regression parameters uniformly, the parameters representing estimation errors and updates were standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (Wood et al., 2008). Note that we did not include the updates and estimation errors simultaneously into one model because of high correlations between these two variables. The resulting multicollinearity would have compromised the estimation of model  parameters and the interpretability of separate parametric modulators (Wood et al., 2008).  At the second level of the comparative analysis relating to second estimation, a ﬂexible factorial model with two regressors relating to parametric modulation of self_p and self_n by updates, and with two regressors relating to parametric modulation of self_p and self_n by estimation errors were computed, and the vmPFC cluster from Table 3A was used as search volume. In accordance with the ﬁnding that only update but not estimation error was a signiﬁcant predictor of the differential activity in the vmPFC, the interaction effect [(self_pupdate N self_nupdate) N (self_pestimation error N self_nestimation error)] revealed that the effect of updates on differential activity in the vmPFC was signiﬁcantly stronger than the one of estimation errors (T = 2.77, pFWE-corr = .030, peak at −6/38/−8, cluster size 34).  At the second level of the comparative analysis relating to base rate presentation, a ﬂexible factorial model with two regressors relating to parametric modulation of self_n by updates and estimation errors, respectively, was computed and the signiﬁcant clusters from Table 3B (inverse contrast self_n) were used as search volume.

The greater recruitment of the network including the thalamus (Th), the fusiform gyrus extending into the hippocampus (Hipp), the primary visual cortex (V1), the ventral striatum (vStr) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the smaller the subsequent belief updates resulting in an undesirable future outlook.  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  159  with the ﬁnding that only update but not estimation error was a significant predictor of the activity in the respective areas, the comparison self_nupdate b self_nestimation error revealed that the effect of updates was signiﬁcantly stronger than the one of estimation errors in the lingual gyrus (T = 4.53, pFWE-corr = .002, peak at −22/−68/−6, cluster size 22), and the vStr (T = 4.25, pFWE-corr = .004, peak at 14/8/−4, cluster size 13). For the thalamus, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the dmPFC the difference was signiﬁcant only at a threshold not corrected for multiple comparisons (puncorrs b .05, Ts N 1.96).  Note that as we used the results reported in the “Neural correlates of updates during the second estimation” section and in the “Neural correlates of updates during the reception of base rates” section as search volumes, the comparative analyses at the second level are biased in favor of analyses based on updates. Importantly, however, the comparative analyses were not conducted to examine whether updates or estimation errors can generally better account for the data, but to show that the update-dependent activation patterns are indeed signiﬁcantly better accounted for by updates than by estimation errors.  Differential neural correlates of updates dependent on trait optimism  Comparisons of the BOLD response patterns in all reported local maxima between subsamples with low and high trait optimism revealed only one signiﬁcant difference, relating to the activity in the Rolandic operculum extending into the insula that exhibited an inverse correlation with updates (see Table 3, self_p, inverse correlation).  Discussion  The overall behavioral data corroborate prior ﬁndings of decreased updating in response to undesirable new information, and indicate that this effect is stronger for judgments referring to oneself than to others (Kuzmanovic et al., 2015; Sharot et al., 2011). The interaction effect reﬂecting the particularly strong optimism bias for self-referential judgments was also signiﬁcant when using standardized update values, which control for inter-individual differences in the general tendency to update initial estimates. Moreover, the self-speciﬁc optimism bias in updates was independent of the size of ﬁrst and second estimates, as well as of the size of presented base rates and induced estimation errors. Debrieﬁng revealed that the participants were not aware of their biased belief updating. More speciﬁcally, none of the participants were aware that the difference in updating after desirable and undesirable information matters for the research question and that they generated such a difference in their own updating. This indicates that the optimism bias in belief updating represents a covert and unintentional inﬂuence on judgments. This spontaneous dismissal of negative information calling for unfavorable belief adjustments constitutes a possible mechanism for maintaining optimism in the face of challenging new evidence (Hughes and Zaki, 2015; Sharot et al., 2011), which is particularly important when beliefs are self-relevant.  Finally, the behavioral results showed that the update behavior was modulated by trait optimism. Only highly trait-optimistic participants, but not those scoring low on trait optimism, showed the selfprotective update pattern that selectively neglects undesirable selfreferential information, without at the same time exhibiting such a bias for other-related judgments. Along with the cross-correlations between trait optimism, self-reported depression symptoms, and biased updating, these results support the view that optimistic distortions in judgment formation are related to affective states and to general expectations toward the future. However, there was no signiﬁcant correlation between trait optimism and the initial tendency to estimate one's own risks for adverse events to be lower than those of similar others (i.e., before being provided with base rates, 1stEself_other), in good accordance with the literature referring to ‘comparative optimism’ (Shepperd et al., 2002).  The primary aim of the fMRI data analyses was to provide empirical support for the assumed motivational causes of the optimism bias.  Such motivational explanations relate to the assumed pleasure of favorable self-referential prospective thinking, and to decision processes guided by these desired end-states of judgments (D'Argembeau et al., 2009; Hughes and Zaki, 2015; Sharot et al., 2011; Shepperd et al., 2002). In contrast to previous research launching the present paradigm (Sharot et al., 2011), we focused on the neural correlates of updates, and not on those of estimation errors, because updates are expected to reﬂect the subjective value of the adjusted expectation toward the future more closely than estimation errors. For completeness, we report and discuss replications of previous results relating to estimation errors (Sharot et al., 2011) in the Supplementary Material (S.4, S.8 and S.10). Importantly, we could show that the effects in the vmPFC and the vStr represent unique update-dependent variance in the BOLD signal, which is different from the one relating to estimation errors, or base rates.  In the following, we discuss the neural correlates of updates during the second estimation and during the reception of base rates, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the point of updating during the period from the presentation of the base rates up to the response indicating the ﬁnal estimate, we roughly assume that the presentation of base rates represents an early and preliminary stage of the judgment formation process, while the phase immediately before the response indicating the second estimate represents the ﬁnal decision.  Neural correlates of updates during the second estimation  The differential subjective value of self-referential belief updates at the time point of the ﬁnal update decision was reﬂected by the activity in the subgenual vmPFC: The BOLD response increased both with increasing favorable and with decreasing unfavorable updates. In other words, both large favorable belief updates, and small unfavorable belief updates (or refraining from updating) were associated with increased activity in the vmPFC. Critically, this activation pattern was not present during judgments regarding similar others, and the interaction term conﬁrmed that it was speciﬁc for judgments concerning oneself (however at a more liberal threshold, see the “fMRI data” section). Note that for both favorable and unfavorable updating, the size of updates represents the adjustment of the ﬁrst estimate toward the presented base rate, which in both conditions results (mostly) in positive signed values (i.e., after positive/lower base rates, a lower second estimate was expected, thus update was computed as ﬁrst estimate − second estimate, and vice versa). From the point of view of the judging subject, both large belief updates toward smaller risks, and small or zero belief updates toward higher risks have a positive value. Thus, the vmPFC reﬂected the particularly salient subjective value of belief updates relating to one's own future risks.  While the vmPFC has been shown to play a central role in representing the subjective value of emotional stimuli and rewards (Levy and Glimcher, 2012; Ochsner et al., 2012; Winecoff et al., 2013), it also has been associated with other cognitive functions, for instance with encoding of personal signiﬁcance (D'Argembeau, 2013; Kim and Johnson, 2015). Nevertheless, two reasons speak for the interpretation implying the representation of values. First, our ﬁndings are highly speciﬁc: the activity in the vmPFC increased with increasing favorable updates, and decreased with increasing unfavorable updates. Explanations relating to personal signiﬁcance cannot account for these conversely directed results because increasing sizes of both favorable and unfavorable updates should be of similar personal signiﬁcance. Second, favorable belief updating recruited speciﬁcally the subgenual region of the vmPFC (also termed subgenual or subcallosal cingulate), which exactly overlaps with the only correlate of expected value reported by the most recent meta-analysis of human neuroimaging studies using reinforcement learning models (Chase et al., 2015, peak coordinates 4/34/−6; see also Levy and Glimcher, 2012). In addition, probabilistic frameworks using large-scale mappings between human  160  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  neural and cognitive states conﬁrm that the subgenual vmPFC is selectively, and not just consistently associated with the term ‘value’ (http://www.neurosynth.org, z-score of the reverse inference map at −6/36/−6 = 5.41; Yarkoni et al., 2011). Therefore, it can be argued that the differential engagement of the subgenual vmPFC supports the notion that favorable beliefs are associated with pleasure and emotional beneﬁts, comparable to rewards.  Recently, the subgenual vmPFC has been related to motivational inﬂuences on self-referential cognition beyond the general representation of positive values and rewards. At the between-subject level, trait optimism scores correlated with the differential activity in the vmPFC while imagining self-referential positive future events relative to negative ones (Sharot et al., 2007). The vmPFC was also recruited by processing positive personality traits relative to negative ones (Beer and Hughes, 2010), particularly when they were regarded as selfdescriptive relative to non-descriptive (Moran et al., 2006), or were ascribed to close vs. non-close others (Hughes and Beer, 2012). However, while these studies on self-enhancing processing were always compounded with the general effect of valence of stimuli (e.g., positive vs. negative traits or events), our study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that the subgenual vmPFC tracks the affective meaning of judgments, independently of the valence of judged stimuli. The subjective value in the present task is deﬁned by trial-to-trial ﬂuctuations of belief updating, which were always related to risks of experiencing negative future events. In such an overall negative context of reasoning, the subjective value of the ﬁnal belief is computed relative to the avoided, relatively worst alternative. In accordance with this, a computational modeling study recently demonstrated that successful avoidance of options associated with a high probability of punishment (75% probability of losing 0.5€) in favor of options associated with a lower risk of punishment (25% probability of loss) can acquire a positive value, although the chosen and the avoided options are both not rewarding per se (Palminteri et al., 2015). Similarly, in the context of stimuli with positive and negative valences, the vmPFC activity correlated with personal, self-reported ratings rather than with objective stimulus characteristics (Winecoff et al., 2013). Thus, the subgenual vmPFC seems to be involved in the internal computation of values of beliefs, even in the absence of the actual satisfying (future) event outcome, and irrespective of the presence of rewarding stimuli per se (Leary, 2007). In turn, such internally modulated subjective values may play a critical role in emotion regulation and positively biased judgment formation (Ochsner et al., 2012).  Additional – yet indirect – support for the speciﬁc role of the subgenual vmPFC in motivated cognition during self-referential judgments comes from depression research. Particularly the subgenual vmPFC shows critical dysfunctions in patients with major depression, and is the target region of deep brain stimulation in treatmentresistant patients (Holtzheimer et al., 2012; Lozano et al., 2008). At the same time, depression has been associated with decreased optimism bias in belief updating (Garrett et al., 2014; Korn et al., 2014), and impaired emotion regulation (Joormann and Quinn, 2014). Thus, adaptive interactions between the mood state, belief formation, and reward and emotional reactivity seem to critically depend on the dense neural connections crossing the subgenual vmPFC.  At the time of the ﬁnal update decision, additional brain regions in which the activity inversely correlated with the size of updates were revealed. Because these ﬁndings are not directly related to our research question, we do not discuss them in detail.  and undesirable base rates there was an inverse correlation between the subsequent update size and the activity in a network of regions including the thalamus, the fusiform gyrus extending into the hippocampus, early visual regions, the vStr and the dmPFC. In other words, the more participants recruited this network while being confronted with self-related undesirable base rates, the less they subsequently updated their initial estimate. A direct comparison conﬁrmed that the effect was speciﬁc for judgments relating to oneself relative to those about others (however at a more liberal threshold, see the “fMRI data” section). Consequently, this network may play a crucial role in dismissing the relevance of self-relevant unfavorable information in the early stage of the judgment formation process.  However, the exact cognitive processes involved in suppressing belief updates in response to undesirable information cannot be deducted from our data, as we did not assess the speciﬁc thoughts or judgment criteria of the participants. Based on theoretical frameworks of comparative thinking (Mussweiler, 2003) and prior ﬁndings regarding the selection of the “average target” (Shepperd et al., 2002) we can make some suggestions regarding possible interpretations of the predictive coding of unfavorable updates. Possibly, personal characteristics (e.g., family history, life style and precautionary intentions) are selectively recalled in a way to support a relatively decreased personal risk compared to the average person. For instance, when confronted with an unexpectedly high base rate for a disease, one could recall one's own healthy lifestyle that contrasts the overall unhealthy lifestyle of the “average person” to promote the conclusion that high risks do not need to be applied to oneself. This speculation is in good accordance with the known functional roles of the recruited network. The hippocampus (Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012) and the dmPFC (Spreng and Grady, 2010; Spreng et al., 2009) are associated with mnestic, inferential and prospective processing necessary for case speciﬁc reasoning. Furthermore, the vStr and the thalamus play an important role in reward learning, which suggests that their involvement may reﬂect the adjustment of the information processing in line with the anticipated value of the ensuing belief updates (Galvan et al., 2005).  The predictive engagements of the vStr in the early stage of judgment formation and of the vmPFC in its ﬁnal phase ﬁt well with the differential functions suggested for these core components of the neural reward circuitry. While the vStr has been related to prediction errors and to the formation of preferences early after the confrontation with the target stimulus, the vmPFC has reﬂected the conceptual, abstract value of outcomes (Chase et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2007; O'Doherty, 2004; Roy et al., 2012). Thus, in order to dismiss information calling for unfavorable future outlooks, vStr may provide rapid signals that are able to interact with and inﬂuence other cognitive processes in order to achieve more valuable subsequent decision outcomes (Kim et al., 2007). In addition, the previous demonstration that such coding of initial preferences by the vStr occurs automatically, i.e., even in the absence of the explicit instruction to evaluate the value of a stimulus (Kim et al., 2007), is consistent with the fact that the participants in our study were not aware of their selective neglect of undesirable, self-relevant base rates during their belief updating.  In contrast to self-relevant judgment formation, undesirable information relevant for judgments about others engaged a network adjacent to the white matter with signiﬁcant but weak inverse correlations with subsequent updates.  Limitations  Neural correlates of updates during the reception of base rates  Our second analysis of the fMRI data focused on the correlation between updates and the BOLD signal during the base rate presentation. This analysis aimed to explore which neural activity predicts the size of the subsequent estimate adjustment at the moment of being confronted with the disproving information. For self-related judgments  While we found signiﬁcantly different behavioral patterns of belief updating between subsamples with high and low trait optimism, comparing these subsamples with respect to their neural correlates did not reveal signiﬁcant differences (with one exception, contrast self_p, inverse correlation, see Table 3A). This indicates that the described neural responses to updates varying in size and desirability represent a  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 133 (2016) 151–162  161  common feature of processing self-referential information, independent of inter-individual differences in general expectations toward the future. Another possible explanation is that non-signiﬁcant results may be related to the inﬂated type II error due to the small subsample sizes recruited in our study. In addition to this general problem, the low variance of trait optimism may also explain the lack of signiﬁcant differences in the neural correlates. However, recruiting participants with low trait optimism and negative self-views might require a systematic search because about 70% of the general population tend to have positive self-views (Swann and Jennifer, 2010).  Two other limitations of the present study relate to the estimation errors. First, our algorithm for manipulation of estimation errors could not achieve perfectly balanced errors between the conditions because the mean positive estimation errors were lower than the negative ones (for more details see also S.1). While the range of the manipulated errors was still better controlled than if we had taken true and ﬁxed base rates, the algorithm should be improved to enable a fully balanced error computation. Critically, the interpretation of our behavioral results in terms of an optimistic bias is not questioned by this imbalance, because formal learning models predict that the updating should be greater the bigger the estimation error. Although in positive trials the estimation errors were on average smaller, the mean belief updating was signiﬁcantly larger. Consequently, the smaller estimation errors in positive trials indicate that the optimism bias may even be underestimated to some extent.  The second limitation relates to the imprecise assessment of subjectively experienced estimation errors (see also SI2 and Kuzmanovic et al., 2015). While formally the estimation error corresponds to the difference between the participants' ﬁrst estimate and the presented base rate in each trial of the experiment, the participants may not perceive this difference as an indication that their initial judgment was erroneous because of personal vulnerabilities or resources. For instance, a strong family history of cancer may suggest a higher personal risk of suffering from cancer relative to the population base rate, so that a presentation of a lower population base rate need not be perceived as an error. In order to further improve the methodological precision of the paradigm, subjective estimation errors should be more carefully assessed.  Conclusion  Different ways of assessing the optimism bias exist, yet little is known about the underlying psychological processes and neural mechanisms. Our ﬁndings suggest that particularly when making judgments regarding one's own future and being confronted with undesirable information that calls for belief adjustments toward unfavorable future outlooks, a network including the vStr, the thalamus, the hippocampus, and the dmPFC is activated in order to prevent detrimental updating. More speciﬁcally, the more these regions associated with rewardbased learning and complex cognitive processing (including memory retrieval, mental visual emulation and inferential reasoning) were activated, the smaller the subsequent unfavorable update. During the ﬁnal computation of self-related belief updates, the positive value of these salient decisions was mirrored by the subgenual vmPFC: Both large belief updates toward better future outcomes, and refraining from updates that would have led to worse future outcomes have a positive subjective value and were accompanied by an increased activity. The fact that central nodes of the neural reward circuitry were recruited dependent on the valence of self-referential judgments provides empirical evidence that cognitive and motivational processes are closely intertwined in optimistic distortions in reasoning. Our ﬁndings support the conclusion that the human cognitive system is motivationally predisposed to dismiss undesirable information and attend to desirable information due to the emotional value of the so achieved optimistic judgment outcomes.

By working with blind individuals, we can ask both what kinds of representations people form about others’ minds, and how much these representations depend on the observer having had similar mental states themselves. Thinking about others’ mental states depends on a speciﬁc group of brain regions, including the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). We investigated the representations of others’ mental states in these brain regions, using multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA). We found that, ﬁrst, in the RTPJ of sighted adults, the pattern of neural response distinguished the source of the mental state (did the protagonist see or hear something?) but not the valence (did the protagonist feel good or bad?). Second, these neural representations were preserved in congenitally blind adults. These results suggest that the temporo-parietal junction contains explicit, abstract representations of features of others’ mental states, including the perceptual source. The persistence of these representations in congenitally blind adults, who have no ﬁrst-person experience with sight, provides evidence that these representations emerge even in the absence of relevant ﬁrst-person perceptual experiences.

Introduction  Imagine a friend tells you that last night, looking out the window onto a dark, rainy street, she saw her boyfriend get into a car with a strange woman, and drive away. Your reaction will depend on many inferences about her thoughts and feelings. You will recognize that she believes her boyfriend is being unfaithful, and feels betrayed. You might also note the source of her belief, and question how clearly she could see at a distance and in the dark. Perhaps she was mistaken about the identity of the man getting into the car, or about the driver; maybe the driver ⇑ Corresponding author.

Knowing how she got her information might strongly affect how you reason about her beliefs and experiences – do you yourself believe that her boyfriend is being unfaithful? How strongly do you think she believes it? What is she likely to do next?  Now imagine that you are congenitally blind. Would your inferences be any different? Clearly, a blind adult would understand the emotional toll of discovering a lover’s possible betrayal, but could a blind person make the same inferences about the visual source of the discovery? How much would a blind person understand about the experience of seeing a familiar person and a strange woman, from afar, in the dark?  Blind people’s inferences about how other people see provide a window into a fundamental question about the human capacity to think about one another’s thoughts:  66  J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  what are the mechanisms used to think about someone else’s mind? One possibility is that we think about someone’s experience by invoking our own relevant experiences and sensations. In this view, thinking about someone else’s experience of seeing requires (among other things) a ﬁrstperson experience of sight. In contrast, if people use an intuitive ‘‘theory’’ of mind, composed of relationships among abstract mental state concepts, to reason about others’ experiences, then experience of sight is not always necessary for reasoning about seeing. In many cases, these views are hard to disentangle; however, they predict different outcomes in blindness. If ﬁrst-person experience is necessary to understand others’ experiences, blind people should have only a fragmentary, limited, or metaphorical understanding of seeing. By asking how blind individuals represent other’s experiences of sight, we can place important limits on our theories of mental state inference: to what extent does theory of mind depend on the observer having had similar sensations, experiences, beliefs, and feelings as the target?  The ﬁrst possibility is that people understand another’s mind by trying to replicate it, by imagining themselves in a similar situation, or by re-experiencing a similar past event of their own lives. You would understand your friend’s feelings of sadness by imagining your own feelings in response to a lover’s betrayal, recreating in your emotional system a version of your friend’s experience. Similarly, you would understand your friend’s experience of seeing her boyfriend get into the car by recreating the visual scene in your own mind’s eye (Gordon, 1989; Stich & Nichols, 1992). Understanding others’ minds thus depends on the observer having experienced a relevantly similar mental state to the target (Gallese & Goldman, 1998; Goldman, 1989, 2006; Gordon, 1989; Harris, 1992; Nichols, Stich, Leslie, & Klein, 1996; Stich & Nichols, 1992). Simulationbased accounts do not necessarily posit that people can only think about exactly those experiences that they themselves have had; rather, mental state representation could be a composition of one’s existing relevantly similar ﬁrstperson experiences, composed ﬂexibly to simulate a novel experience. Still, because simulation depends on similar experiences, the extent to which we can simulate the minds of others depends on ‘‘the interpersonal sharing of the same kind of neural and cognitive resources. When this sharing is limited (or even missing), people are not fully able (or are not able at all) to map the mental states or processes of others because they do not have suitable mental states or processes to reuse’’ (Gallese & Sinigaglia, 2011). Because congenitally blind people lack the mental states and processes involved in seeing, their representations of sight are predicted to be limited or unreliable.  Neuroimaging experiments provide evidence that ﬁrstperson sensorimotor representations are ‘‘reused’’ during observation of others’ actions and sensations. Similar brain regions are recruited when experiencing physical pain compared to observing another person experience similar pain (e.g., Botvinick et al., 2005; Immordino-Yang, McColl, Damasio, & Damasio, 2009; Singer et al., 2004); and when experiencing a tactile sensation compared to observing another person being touched in the same way (Blakemore, 2005; Keysers:2004dj Gazzola & Keysers,  2009). More importantly, neural activity during some observation tasks depends on the observer’s own speciﬁc ﬁrst-person experiences. For example, motor activation in dancers during observation of dance moves is enhanced for speciﬁc movements that the observers themselves have frequently executed (Calvo-Merino, Glaser, Grèzes, Passingham, & Haggard, 2005; Calvo-Merino, Grèzes, Glaser, Passingham, & Haggard, 2006). If this type of reuse extends to mental state representation, typical representations of other’s experiences of seeing should depend on, or be profoundly affected by, having ﬁrst seen yourself.  However, many authors (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997; Gopnik & Wellman, 1992; Perner, 1993; Saxe, 2005) have suggested an alternative mechanism for understanding other minds: namely, that people have an intuitive theory of other minds. An intuitive theory includes causal relations among abstract concepts (like beliefs and desires), and can be learned from many sources of evidence, not limited to ﬁrst-person experiences. One source of evidence children could use to build a theory of mind is the testimony of others: verbal labels and descriptions of mental states and experiences, often including mental state verbs like think and see (Harris, 2002b; 1992). Thus a congenitally blind child, growing up in a world full of sighted people, might develop an intuitive theory that includes concepts of vision, to explain everyone else’s behavior (e.g. reacting to objects at a distance) and testimony (e.g. saying ‘‘I see your toy on the top shelf!’’). This intuitive theory would then allow a blind child to predict how a sighted person would act in a given environment, and what that person would be likely to infer based on what she could see.  To test these theories, we investigated how blind people think about sight. Observation and behavioral studies suggest that even young blind children know that other people can see with their eyes, and can understand basic principles of vision: e.g. that objects can be seen from a distance and are invisible in the dark (Bigelow, 1992; Landau & Gleitman, 1985; Peterson & Webb, 2000). By adulthood, congenitally blind people know the meanings of verbs of sight, including ﬁne-grained distinctions, such as the difference between verbs like peer, gaze, and gawk (Koster-Hale, Saxe, & Bedny, in prep; Landau & Gleitman, 1985; Lenci, Baroni, Cazzolli, & Marotta, 2013). Blind adults are thus sensitive to subtle distinctions in how sighted people gather information visually.  This behavioral evidence alone, however, cannot answer the question of whether a blind person uses the same cognitive mechanisms as a sighted person to understand sight. Any surface similarity between a blind and sighted person’s verbal descriptions of sight could be the product of compensatory mechanisms in the blind. For example, some authors have suggested that blind people mimic the words used by sighted people, without being able to fully access their meaning (so-called ‘‘verbalisms,’’ Rosel, Caballer, Jara, & Oliver, 2005) or integrate them into their conceptual understanding. Thus, a blind person who hears the sentence ‘‘I saw my boyfriend getting into the car from the window,’’ may have only a limited or metaphorical understanding of the experience it describes.  J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  67  This methodological challenge affords an opportunity for cognitive neuroscience: functional neuroimaging can provide an online, unobtrusive measure of ongoing psychological processes and thus offers an alternative strategy to ask if two groups of people are performing a cognitive task using similar or different mechanisms. Here we use neuroimaging to ask whether blind and sighted people rely on similar cognitive mechanisms when they reason about seeing.  Bullmore,  Chakrabarti,  Previous studies have shown that thinking about someone else’s thoughts (including those based on visual experiences, Bedny, Pascual-Leone, & Saxe, 2009) increases metabolic activity in a speciﬁc group of brain regions often called the ‘mentalizing’ or theory of mind network. These regions include the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the precuneus (PC), and the bilateral temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), (e.g., Aichhorn et al., 2009; Bedny et al., 2009; Lombardo, Baron-Cohen, & Consortium, 2011; Mason & Just, 2011; Rabin, Gilboa, Stuss, Mar, & Rosenbaum, 2010; Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003; Saxe & Powell, 2006; Spunt, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2010). However, very little is known about which aspects of mental states are represented in these brain regions. Mental experiences have many features, including the content (‘‘boyfriend in stranger’s car’’), the valence (very sad), and the modality or source of the experience (seen from afar). Neurons, or groups of neurons, within theory of mind brain regions may represent any or all of these features. Thus, two important questions remain open. First, in sighted people, do neurons in any theory of mind region speciﬁcally represent the perceptual source of another person’s belief? Second, if so, are similar representations present in blind people?  A powerful approach for understanding neural representation is to ask which features of a stimulus are represented by distinct subpopulations of neurons within a region. For example, within middle temporal visual, subpopulations of neurons that respond to visual stimuli moving orientations are spatially organized at a ﬁne spatial scale. Although no individual fMRI voxel (which includes hundred of thousands of neurons) shows an orientation selective response, and therefore overall early visual cortex shows equal average magnitude of response to all orientations, it is possible to detect reliably distinct spatial patterns of response across cortex that do distinguish between orientations (Kamitani & Tong, 2006). This technique of fMRI response within a brain region is called multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA; Haynes & Rees, 2006; Kriegeskorte & Bandettini, 2007; Norman, Polyn, Detre, & Haxby, 2006). MVPA can reveal how stimulus categories are processed within a functional region (Haynes & Rees, 2006; Peelen, Wiggett, & Downing, 2006). MVPA has been successfully used to probe the neural basis of many different types of representation, including subjectively perceived directions of motion in ambiguous stimuli, semantic category, emotional affect, and intent when causing harm (Koster-Hale, Saxe, Dungan, & Young, 2013; Mahon & Caramazza, 2010; e.g., Norman et al., 2006; Peelen et al., 2006; Serences & Boynton, 2007).  looking for reliable spatial patterns of  Here, we ask if source modality (seeing vs. hearing) is a relevant feature of the neural representations of mental  states. If one set of neurons responds more to stories about seeing than hearing, while another (partially distinct) set responds more to stories about hearing than seeing, we have evidence that seeing and hearing are being represented in different ways in that brain region. Measuring the average magnitude of activity in theory of mind brain regions cannot be used to address this question, because the average magnitude may obscure distinct subpopulations of neurons within the regions. We therefore used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to look for differences in the neural response to stories about hearing and seeing. In this study, we ﬁrst asked whether stories about someone else’s hearing and seeing experiences evoke different spatial patterns of response within theory of mind brain regions in sighted individuals. Because very little is known about how theory of mind is represented, cognitively or neurally, this is itself a fundamental question about mental state representation. We then asked whether the same patterns are observed in congenitally blind people. Finding these patterns would provide support for the notion that blind individuals represent mental experiences of seeing in a qualitatively similar manner to sighted individuals. For comparison, we also tested whether theory of mind regions encode a feature of mental states that should not differ between sighted and blind people: the valence (feeling good versus bad).  2. Methods  2.1. Participants  participated  (5 women; mean  Thirteen sighted members of the larger MIT community participated (8 women; mean age ± SD, 52 years ± 16), all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Ten blind individuals age ± SD, 50 years ± 7). Nine blind participants were born blind and one lost sight between the ages of 2 and 3 years. Due to possible effects of early vision, this person was excluded from all analyses. All blind participants reported having at most faint light perception and no pattern discrimination. None were able to perceive shapes, colors, or motion. One blind participant was ambidextrous and one was left-handed; one sighted participant was left-handed. All were native English speakers and gave written informed consent in accordance with the requirements of the Institutional Review Board at MIT. Participants were compensated $30/h for their time.  2.2. Comparison to Bedny et al. (2009)  These data have previously been published, analyzing the magnitude but not the pattern of response in each region, in Bedny et al. (2009). Bedny et al. (2009) found that theory of mind regions showed equally high responses to stories about hearing and seeing, in both sighted and blind participants. However, measuring the average magnitude across the entire region may obscure distinct subpopulations of neurons within a region. Speciﬁcally, the equally high magnitude of response to stories about seeing and hearing observed by Bedny et al. (2009) is consistent  68  J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  with three possibilities: (i) neurons in theory of mind brain regions do not distinguish between hearing and seeing in blind or sighted people, (ii) distinct subpopulations of neurons within theory of mind brain regions respond to stories about seeing versus hearing in both sighted and blind participants, reﬂecting a common representation of the perceptual source of other’s mental states, or (iii) distinct subpopulations of neurons respond to seeing versus hearing in sighted but not blind individuals, reﬂecting different representations in the two groups, depending on their ﬁrst person experiences. The current analyses allowed us to distinguish between these possibilities.  Note that the current results exclude one blind participant who was included in the previous paper: this participant was born with cataracts and had some light and shape perception during the ﬁrst ten years of his life. To be conservative, we exclude his data from the current analyses.  Finally, the previous paper included an analysis of reaction time to the behavioral portion of the task (judging how good or bad the protagonist felt at the end of the story), looking at the seeing events, hearing events, and additional control events, all collapsed across valence. In this paper, we are also treating valence as a dimension of interest in the neural data, and so break down the behavioral data by both modality and valence to report reaction time and rating data.  2.3. fMRI protocol and task  2.3.1. Main experiment  Participants heard 32 stories (each 13 s long): four stories in each of eight conditions. Stories in the four conditions of interest described a protagonist’s mental experiences, characterized by both a modality-speciﬁc source (something seen or heard) and a modality-independent valence (whether the protagonist felt good or bad). The ‘‘seeing’’ stories described the protagonist coming to believe something as a result of a visual experience, such as seeing a friend’s worried face or recognizing someone’s handwriting. The ‘‘hearing’’ stories described the protagonist coming to believe something as a result of an auditory experience, such as hearing a friend’s worried voice or recognizing someone’s footsteps. The stories with negative valence described an event that would make the protagonist feel bad, such as receiving criticism or losing a game; the stories with positive valence described a good event, such as receiving praise or winning a game (Fig. 1). The remaining four control conditions, which did not describe mental experiences, are not analyzed here (see Bedny et al., 2009 for details).  For each narrative context (e.g. a job interview, dinner with parents-in-law, cleaning a dorm room), we constructed four endings, one in each condition. Thus the stories formed a matched and counterbalanced 2  2 (seeing vs. hearing, positive vs. negative) design. Individual participants saw each context only once; every context occurred in all conditions, across participants. Word count was matched across (mean length ± SD, 32 words ± 4). Stories were presented in a pseudorandom order, condition order was counterbalanced across runs  conditions  Fig. 1. Example stimuli.  and subjects, and no condition was immediately repeated. Rest blocks of 11 s were presented after each story. Eight stories were presented in each 4 min 34 s run. The total experiment, four runs, lasted 18 min 18 s.  After each story, participants indicated whether the main character in the story felt very bad, a little bad, a little good, or very good, using a button press (1–4). Reaction time was measured from the onset of each question.  2.3.2. Theory of mind localizer task  state representations  Participants also completed a theory of mind and language localizer task. Participants listened to 48 short verbal stories from two conditions: 24 stories requiring inferences about mental (e.g., thoughts, beliefs) and 24 stories requiring inferences about physical representations (e.g., maps, signs, photographs). These conditions were similar in their meta-representational and logical complexity but differ in whether the reader is building a representation of someone else’s mental state (See Dodell-Feder, Koster-Hale, Bedny, & Saxe, 2011; Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003, and Bedny et al., 2009 for further discussion). After each story, participants answered a true/false question about the story. As a control condition, participants listed to 24 blocks of ‘‘noise,’’ unintelligible backwards speech created by playing the stories backwards. The task was performed in 6 runs with 12 items per run (4 belief, 4 physical, and 4 backwardspeech). Each run was 6 min and 12 s long. The stimuli for the localizer and both experiments were digitally recorded by a female speaker at a sampling rate of 44,100 to produce 32-bit digital sound ﬁles.  2.4. Acquisition and preprocessing  fMRI data were collected in a 3T Siemens scanner at the Athinoula A. Martinos Imaging Center at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, using a 12-channel head coil. Using standard echoplanar imaging procedures, we acquired T1-weighted structural images in 128 axial slices with 1.33 mm isotropic voxels (TR = 2 ms, TE = 3.39 ms), and functional blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data slices using 3  3  4 mm voxels in 30 near-axial  J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  69  (TR = 2 s, TE = 40 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°). To allow for steady state magnetization, the ﬁrst 4 s of each run were excluded. Data processing and analysis were performed using SPM2 (http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and custom software. The data were motion corrected, realigned, normalized onto a common brain space (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template), spatially smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁlter (full-width half-maximum 5 mm kernel) and subjected to a high-pass ﬁlter (128 Hz).  2.5. Motion and artifact analysis  To estimate motion and data quality, we used three measures for each participant: mean translation was deﬁned as the average absolute translation for each TR across the x, y, and z plane; mean rotation was deﬁned as the average absolute rotation per TR across yaw, pitch, and roll; and number of outliers per run was deﬁned as the average number of time points per run in which (a) TR-to-TR head movement exceeded 2 mm of translation, or (b) global mean signal deviated by more than three standard deviations of the mean. One blind participant moved excessively during the scan (mean translation of 1.2 mm, mean rotation of 1.4°, and mean outliers per run = 20.7, compared to other blind participants’ means of 0.33 mm of rotation, 0.35° of rotation, and 2.5 outliers), so his results were dropped from the analyses.  2.6. fMRI analysis  All fMRI data were modeled using a boxcar regressor, convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function (HRF). The general linear model was used to analyze the BOLD data from each subject, as a function of condition. The model included nuisance covariates for run effects, global mean signal, and an intercept term. A slow event-related design was used. An event was deﬁned as a single story, the event onset was deﬁned by the onset of the story sound ﬁle, and offset as the end of the story.  2.6.1. Functional localizer: Individual subject ROIs  In each participant, functional regions of interest (ROIs) were deﬁned in right and left temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ, LTPJ), medial precuneus (PC), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC1), and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC1). Each subject’s contrast image (Belief > Photo) was masked with each of the regions’ likely locations, using probabilistic maps created from a separate dataset. The peak voxel that occurred in a cluster of 10 or more voxels significant at p < 0.001 was selected. All voxels within a 9 mm radius of individually signiﬁcant at p < 0.001, were deﬁned as the ROI.  the peak voxel,  2.6.2. Within-ROI pattern analysis  Split-half correlation-based MVPA asks whether the neural pattern in a region is sensitive to a category-level distinction. Speciﬁcally, we ask whether the neural pat 1 Note that in Bedny et al., 2009, DMPFC was referred to as SOFC, and  VMPFC was referred to as OFC.  terns generated by items within a condition are more similar to each other (‘‘within-condition correlation’’) than to the neural patterns generated by items in the other conditions (‘‘across-condition correlation’’). If we ﬁnd that within-condition correlations are reliably higher than across-condition correlations, we can conclude that there are reliable neural pattern generated by different items within a condition, and that these neural patterns are distinct from one condition to another. Together, this suggests that the region is sensitive to the category distinction – items within a category are coded in a similar way, with distinguishable codes for different categories.  Here, we conducted within-ROI pattern analyses, independently testing for information about belief source and valence in the regions identiﬁed in the independent functional localizer. To compare seeing and hearing beliefs, we collapsed across good and bad valence; to compare good and bad valence, we collapsed across seeing and hearing.  Following Haxby (2001), each participant’s data were divided into even and odd runs (‘partitions’) and then the mean response (beta value) of every voxel in the ROI was calculated for each condition. Because each participant read 8 stories about hearing, seeing, feeling good, and feeling bad, each partition contained the average response to 4 individual stories. The ‘‘pattern’’ of response was the vector of beta values across voxels within the participant’s individual ROI. To determine the within-condition correlation, the pattern in one (e.g. even) partition was correlated with the pattern for the same condition in the opposite (e.g. odd) partition; to determine the across-condition correlations the pattern was compared to the opposite condition, across partitions (Fig. 2).  For each condition pair (e.g. seeing vs. hearing) in each individual, an index of classiﬁcation was calculated as the within-condition correlation (e.g. the correlation of one half of the seeing stories to the other half of seeing stories, averaged with the correlation of one half of the hearing to the other half of hearing stories) minus the acrosscondition correlation (e.g. the correlation of seeing stories compared to hearing stories). To allow for direct comparison of correlation coefﬁcients, we transformed all r values using Fisher’s Z transform. A region successfully classiﬁed a category of stimuli if, across individuals, the withincondition correlation was higher than the across-condition correlation, using a Student’s T complementary cumulative distribution function.  This procedure implements a simple linear decoder. Linear decoding, while in principle less ﬂexible and less powerful than non-linear decoding, is preferable both theoretically and empirically. A non-linear classiﬁer can decode nearly any arbitrary feature contained implicitly within an ROI, reﬂecting properties of the pattern analysis algorithm rather than the brain, which makes successful classiﬁcation largely uninformative (Cox & Savoy, 2003; DiCarlo & Cox, 2007; Goris & Op de Beeck, 2009; Kamitani & Tong, 2005; Norman et al., 2006). Moreover, linear codes have been argued to be a more neurally plausible way of making information available to the next layer of neurons (Bialek, Rieke, Van Steveninck, & Warland, 1991; Butts et al., 2007; DiCarlo & Cox, 2007; Naselaris, Kay, Nishimoto, & Gallant, 2011; Rolls & Treves, 2011).  70  J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  ings and reaction time data. Using a 1 (very bad) to 4 (very good) scale, sighted participants rated protagonists who experienced positive events as feeling better than the protagonists experiencing negative events, with no effect of modality and no interaction (hearing-bad: 1.84 ± 0.14, hearing-good: 3.43 ± 0.14, seeing-bad: 1.88 ± 0.12, seeinggood: 3.65 ± 0.11; main effect of valence: F(1,12) = 223, p < 0.001, partial g2 = 0.79; modality: F(1,12) = 1.2, p = 0.3, partial g2 = 0.02; modality by valence interaction: F(1,12) = 0.4, p = 0.5, partial g2 = 0.01).  Sighted participants showed small, but signiﬁcant effects of condition on reaction time (measured from onset of the question), with a marginal main effect of modality and a small but signiﬁcant interaction (hearing-bad: 5.63 ± 0.23, hearing-good: 5.2 ± 0.21, seeing-bad: 5.03 ± 0.3, seeing-good: 5.28 ± 0.23; main effect of modality: F(1,12) = 4.4, valence: F(1,12) = 0.3, p = 0.5, partial g2 < 0.01; modality by valence interaction: F(1,12) = 6.8, p = 0.002, partial g2 = 0.04). Posthoc t-tests reveal that sighted participants responded more slowly to stories about negative experiences based on hearing than based on seeing (t(12) = 3.3, p = 0.007); there was no effect of modality on responses to positive events (t(12) = 0.47, p = 0.65).  g2 = 0.02;  p = 0.06,  partial  3.1.2. Blind participants  Congenitally blind participants also rated protagonists in positive stories as feeling signiﬁcantly better than those in negative stories, with no effect of modality and no interaction (hearing-bad: 1.81 ± 0.15, hearing-good: 3.51 ± 0.13, seeing-bad: 1.95 ± 0.25, seeing-good: 3.43 ± 0.11; main effect of valence: F(1,8) = 72, p < 0.001, partial g2 = 0.72; modality: F(1,8) = 0.02, p = 0.9, partial g2 < 0.01; modality by valence F(1,8) = 0.5, p = 0.5, partial g2 < 0.02).  interaction:  In reaction time of the blind adults, there were no signiﬁcant effects of modality or valence, and no interaction (hearing-bad: 5.51 ± 0.35, hearing-good: 5.02 ± 0.41, seeing-bad: 5.47 ± 0.33, seeing-good: 5.64 ± 0.3; all F < 3.1, all p > 0.1).  3.1.3. Across groups  We found no differences in the ratings across groups. We performed a 2  2  2 repeated measures ANOVA crossing valence and modality as within-subjects factors with group (blind/sighted) as a between-subjects factor. All participants rated the protagonist as feeling worse in the negative valence stories (F(1,20) = 264, p < 0.001, partial g2 = 0.76), with no main effect of modality or group, and no interactions (all F < 1, p > 0.3).  In the reaction time data, there were no main effects of modality, valence, or group (all F < 1, p > 0.4). We found a small but signiﬁcant modality by valence interaction (F(1,20) = 7.0, p = 0.02, partial g2 = 0.03): participants responded more slowly to stories about negative experiences based on hearing than seeing; and more slowly to stories about positive experiences based on seeing than hearing.  There was also a small group by modality interaction (F(1,20) = 7.4, p = 0.01, partial g2 = 0.02): Sighted adults respond faster than blind adults to stories about seeing;  Fig. 2. Split half MVPA analysis. The data from each condition (e.g. hearing and seeing) were divided by run, and for each participant, we asked whether the within condition correlations (blue arrows) were higher than the across conditions correlations (gray arrows). Data from one blind participant: within-condition correlation = 1.3; across-condition correlation = 0.8. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)  2.6.3. Whole brain pattern analysis (searchlight)  To ask whether any other part of the brain encoded the difference between other people’s experiences of seeing and hearing, or between good and bad events, we used a searchlight analysis to look across the brain. In the searchlight analysis, rather than using a predeﬁned ROI, a Gaussian kernel (14 mm FWHM, corresponding approximately to the observed size of the functional ROIs) was moved iteratively across the brain. Using the same logic as the ROI-based MVPA, we computed the spatial correlation, in each kernel, of the neural response (i.e. betas) within conditions and across conditions. We then transformed the correlations using Fisher’s Z, and subtracted the acrosscondition correlation from the within-condition correlation to create an index of classiﬁcation. Thus, for each voxel, we obtained of how well the spatial pattern of response in the local region (i.e. the area centered on that voxel) can distinguish between the two conditions. The use of a Gaussian kernel smoothly de-emphasizes the inﬂuence of voxels at increasing distances from the reference voxel (Fedorenko, Nieto-Castañón, & Kanwisher, 2012). We created whole brain maps of the index of classiﬁcation for each subject. These individual-subject correlation maps were then subjected to a second-level analysis using a one-sample t-test (thresholded at p < 0.001, voxelwise, uncorrected).  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral  3.1.1. Sighted participants  We performed a 2  2 ANOVA, crossing valence (good/ bad) and modality (seeing/hearing), on both goodness rat J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  71  blind adults respond faster than sighted adults to stories about hearing. Post-hoc t-tests comparing groups within modality (e.g. RTs of blind vs. sighted for seeing stories) revealed no differences in reaction time between groups in either modality (all t < 1.1, all p > 0.2).  3.2. Motion and artifact analysis results  Sighted participants and blind participants showed no difference in the mean translation per run (sighted mean + sd = 0.22 mm ± 0.03, blind = 0.23 mm ± 0.04), t(20) = 0.13, p = 0.9), mean rotation per run (sighted = 0.26 degrees ± 0.04, blind = 0.24 ± 0.04, t(20) = 0.37, p = 0.71, or the mean number of outliers per run (sighted = 0.98 ± 0.46, blind = 0.53 ± 0.35, t(20) = 0.72, p = 0.48) Together, these data suggest the groups were well matched in motion and scanner noise.  3.3. Localizer  Replicating many studies using a similar functional localizer task (e.g. Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003), we localized ﬁve theory of mind brain regions showing greater activation for false belief stories compared to false photograph stories in the majority of participants (uncorrected, p < 0.001, k > 10): Sighted participants: RTPJ 13/13 participants, LTPJ, 12/13, PC 13/13, DMPFC 11/13, VMPFC 11/13; Blind participants: RTPJ 8/9 participants, LTPJ 9/9, PC 9/9 and DMPFC 9/9, VMPFC 9/9 (Fig. 3A). As reported in (Bedny et al., 2009), sighted and blind participants did not differ in the activation or anatomical loci of any active regions (all p > 0.1), nor did blind participants show more variability in spatial location or size of ROIs.  3.4. Within ROI pattern analysis  3.4.1. Sighted participants 3.4.1.1. Source (seeing vs. hearing). Multi-voxel pattern analyses revealed reliably distinct patterns of neural activity for stories about seeing versus hearing in the RTPJ and LTPJ, but not PC, DMPFC, or VMPFC, of sighted adults. Note that correlations are Fisher Z transformed to allow statistical comparisons with parametric tests. Across partitions of the data, the pattern generated by stories in one category (seeing or hearing) was more correlated with the pattern for the same category than with the pattern for the opposite category, in the RTPJ (within condition correlation ± standard error, z = 1.1 ± 0.2, across condition correlation, z = 0.95 ± 0.2, t(12) = 2.0, p = 0.03) and LTPJ (within = 0.82 ± 0.2, across = 0.64 ± 0.2, t(11)=2.0, p = 0.04), but not in the PC (within = 0.86 ± 0.2, t(12)=0.93, p = 0.19), DMPFC (within = 0.7 ± 0.1, across = 0.5 ± 0.2, t(10)=1.2, p = 0.12) or VMPFC (within = 0.58 ± 0.2, across = 0.47 ± 0.2, t(10) = 0.75, p = 0.23, Fig. 3B, Table 1).  across = 0.78 ± 0.2,  To test whether the difference between ROIs itself was signiﬁcant, we conducted a 1  5 repeated measures ANOVA. Because baseline differences in correlations across ROIs are hard to interpret (higher overall correlation in one region compared to another could be due to many factors, including the distance of a region from the coils, amount of vascularization, or region size; see Smith, Kosillo, &  Williams, 2011), we used difference scores (within condition correlation – across condition correlation) as the dependent variable. We found a main effect of ROI (F(4,28) = 3.03, p = 0.03, partial g2 = 0.27), suggesting that the regions contain varying amounts of information about source modality in their neural pattern.  3.4.1.2. Valence (good vs. bad). In no region did the pattern of response distinguish between good and bad valence (all correlation differences t < 0.2, all p > 0.1, Fig. 3B).  3.4.2. Blind participants 3.4.2.1. Source (seeing vs. hearing). Like in sighted adults, the pattern generated by stories within a condition were more correlated with other stories in the same condition compared to stories in the opposite condition in the RTPJ (within condition correlation ± standard error, z = 1.1 ± 0.2, across condition correlation z = 0.93 ± 0.3, t(7) = 2.0, p = 0.04), but not (within = 1.3 ± 0.3, across = 1.3±.03, t(8) = 0.2, p = 0.4), PC (within = 0.71 ± 0.2, across = 0.59 ± 0.2, t(8) = 1.3, p = 0.12), DMPFC (within = 0.83 ± 0.2, across = 0.73 ± 0.1, t(8) = 1.4, p = 0.11) or VMPFC (within = 0.56 ± 0.2, across = 0.34 ± 0.2, t(8) = 1.4, p = 0.11, Fig. 3C, Table 1). This difference between ROIs in discrimination was signiﬁcant (F(4,28) = 4.0, p = 0.01, partial g2 = 0.36).  in the  LTPJ  3.4.2.2. Valence (good vs. bad). As in sighted adults, the pattern of response in congenially blind adults did not distinguish between good and bad valence in any theory of mind region (all correlation differences t < 0.2, all p > 0.1, Fig. 3C).  3.4.3. Across groups 3.4.3.1. Source (seeing vs. hearing). Comparing across groups, we looked for three things: (a) a main effect of discrimination, driven by differences between the withincondition and across-condition correlations in that region: evidence of reliable discrimination between conditions; (b) a main effect of group, which indicates that one group has overall higher correlations, due to higher overall inter-trial correlations independent of condition (and thus not suggestive of interpretable group differences), and (c) an interaction between discrimination and group, such that one group shows a larger difference between the within- and across-condition correlations: evidence that one group shows more sensitivity to condition differences than the other. Finding an interaction would be the key piece of evidence to show that blind and sighted people have difference sensitivity to the condition manipulation.  Overall, we found that blind and sighted adults showed very similar neural patterns, with no evidence that either group was more sensitive to the distinction of seeing versus hearing. We found evidence of distinct neural patterns for seeing and hearing in both blind and sighted adults in the TPJ and no other regions. Speciﬁcally, blind and sighted participants show equally robust neural discrimination of seeing versus hearing in the RTPJ, with a main effect of discrimination (F(1,19) = 7.8, p = 0.01, partial g2 = 0.3), no effect of group (F(1,19) = 0.001, p = 0.9), and, critically, no interaction (F(1,19) = 0.02, p = 0.89). There were no signiﬁcant effects of  72  J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  Fig. 3. MVPA results.

LTPJ showed a trend towards both a main effect of group (overall higher inter-trial correlations in blind participants, F(1,19) = 3.2, p = 0.09) and a main effect of discrimination  (F(1,19) = 3.6, p = 0.07), with no interaction. Precuneus, DMPFC, and VMPFC showed no effects (PC: group: F(1,20) = 0.5, p = 0.5, discrimination: F(1,20) = 2.3, p = 0.14, interaction: group:  F(1,20) = 0.1,  p = 0.7;  DMPFC:  J.

In summary, this suggests that both blind and sighted adults code the difference between other people’s experiences of seeing and hearing in the RTPJ.  3.4.3.2. Valence (good vs. bad). We found no evidence of neural code distinguishing good valence from bad in any brain region of either group. Comparing patterns for valence, we found a main effect of group in the LTPJ (F(1,18) = 5.1, p = 0.04, partial g2 = 0.22), due to higher overall inter-trial correlations in the blind, independent of condition (and thus not suggestive of sensitivity to differences in valence). There were no signiﬁcant effects of group, discrimination, or their interaction in any other ROI.  3.5. Whole brain pattern analysis  3.5.1.

Because of the similarity across groups in the ROI analyses, we combined the data from blind and sighted participants for increased power. Converging with the results of the ROI analyses, the whole brain analysis revealed that only the RTPJ distinguished between seeing versus hearing beliefs (n = 22, peak voxel at [60,  48, 12], p < 0.001, uncorrected peak T = 3.6).  Second, a two-sample T-test across groups revealed a signiﬁcant group difference in the left dorsolateral PFC (BA45/46, peak voxel at [ 58, 30, 8], p < 0.001 uncorrected, peak T = 3.7). In this DLPFC region, sighted participants showed a greater difference between within and across condition correlations than blind participants. No regions showed stronger decoding in blind participants relative to sighted ones.  3.5.2. Valence (good vs. bad)  Combining across groups for power, we ﬁnd that only the anterior cerebellum distinguishes between good and bad emotional valence (n = 22, peak voxel at [12,  42,  32], p < 0.001 uncorrected, peak T = 4.2).  4. General discussion  4.1. MVPA reveals features of mental state representations  For neuroimaging research to have cognitive implications, a key challenge is to go beyond where a cognitive function occurs in the brain, to provide a window into neural representations and computations. Dozens of neuroimaging studies suggest a hypothesis for where in the brain key aspects of theory of mind are processed (e.g., Aichhorn et al., 2009; Bedny et al., 2009; Lombardo et al., 2011; Mason & Just, 2011; Rabin et al., 2010; Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003; Saxe & Powell, 2006; Spunt et al., 2010). The right and left TPJ, the PC, and MPFC show increased hemodynamic responses to stimuli that require  participants to think about other people’s mental states, and many studies have investigated the selectivity and domain speciﬁcity of these brain regions for theory of mind. These brain regions therefore provide a prime opportunity to probe the neural computations of mental state representation: What features of people’s beliefs and intentions are represented, or made explicit, in these brain regions?  A powerful, if simplifying, assumption about neural representation is that a feature is explicitly represented by a population of neurons if that feature can be decoded linearly from the population’s response. Different subpopulations of neurons within a region may contribute to a common task by representing different features or aspects of the stimulus or task. A well-studied example is object recognition in the ventral pathway of macaques. Low-level features of the stimulus, like retinotopic position and motion energy, can be linearly decoded from the population response in early visual cortex, whereas higher-level properties, like object identity (invariant to size and position), can be linearly decoded from the population response in IT, a region further along the processing stream (DiCarlo, Zoccolan, & Rust, 2012; Kamitani & Tong, 2005). We can take advantage of this property of neural populations to identify features of human neural representations using fMRI. When the subpopulations of neurons that respond to different stimulus features are at least partially organized into spatial clusters or maps over cortex (Dehaene & Cohen, 2007; Formisano et al., 2003), those features may be detectable in reliable spatial patterns of activity measurable with fMRI (Haynes & Rees, 2006; Kriegeskorte & Bandettini, 2007; Norman et al., 2006). Multi-voxel pattern analyses therefore offer an exciting opportunity for studying the representations underlying human theory of mind. In spite of many studies on the neural basis of theory of mind, very little is known about which features or dimensions of mental states are represented by the neural populations in the candidate brain regions. Here we identiﬁed two dimensions of others’ mental states that are common and salient: the source modality of the other person’s experience, and the emotional valence. To ask whether either of these dimensions are explicitly represented in these brain regions, we then tested whether either of these dimensions could be linearly decoded from the spatial pattern of the response in any theory of mind brain region.  We found that both the right and left TPJ of sighted people showed distinct spatial patterns of responses to stories that described seeing versus hearing. Two independent groups of stories, similar only in the source modality of the character’s beliefs, elicited reliably similar spatial patterns of response in the TPJ, in spite of the wide heterogeneity of the stories in many other respects (e.g. the physical environment, the type of event, the character’s name, age, gender, social status, etc.). Furthermore, we replicated these results in the right TPJ in an independent group of congenitally blind adults. We therefore suggest that spatially distinguishable neural populations in the TPJ explicitly represent the perceptual source of another person’s mental states. Together with prior evidence, our ﬁndings suggest that these representations develop in the absence of ﬁrst person experience.  74  J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  4.2. Knowledge source and theory of mind  Why might the TPJ code the distinction between seeing and hearing mental states described in stories? One possibility is that the patterns of activation we observed were driven simply by a response to the mental state attitude verb used in the story (i.e. ‘‘sees’’ vs. ‘‘hears’’). However, we consider this interpretation unlikely, for three reasons. First, mental state verbs on their own elicit little to no response in the TPJ, both relative to rest and relative to non-mental verbs (e.g. ‘‘to think’’ vs. ‘‘to run’’ or ‘‘to rust,’’ Bedny, McGill, & Thompson-Schill, 2008). Robust responses are best elicited in TPJ by full propositional attitudes (e.g., a person’s mental attitude towards some content), ideally embedded in an ongoing narrative. Second, in previous research we directly manipulated the mental state verb in a sentence and did not ﬁnd distinct patterns of response in TPJ (e.g. ‘‘believe’’ vs. ‘‘hope’’, Paunov and Saxe, personal communication). Third, in an other experiment, we found distinct patterns of response in TPJ for distinct mental states that were described using the same verb (i.e. intentional vs. accidental harm, both described by ‘‘believed’’, Koster-Hale et al., 2013). In all, we suggest that the patterns of activity observed here are most likely responses to features of the character’s mental state, rather than to speciﬁc verbs in the stories. Still, future research should test this possibility by independently manipulating the source of the mental state and the verb used to describe it, as well as by looking at the pattern evoked by these verbs outside of a mental state context.  Based on the current ﬁndings, we hypothesize that the TPJ contains an explicit representation of the perceptual source of mental states. Why might theory of mind brain regions code this information? Considering the source of others’ knowledge is central to inferences about other people’s minds. Knowing how another person got their information can inﬂuence the inferences we make about what they know, how well they know it, and whether we should believe it ourselves. For example, we are more likely to trust another person’s testimony if they acquired their knowledge by direct visual observation (an ‘‘eye-witness’’) than through gossip or hearsay (Bull Kovera, Park, & Penrod, 1992; Miene, Bordiga, & Park, 1993; Miene, Park, & Bordiga, 1992); eyewitness but not hearsay testimony is admitted as evidence in courts of law (Park, 1987). Similarly, recalling how one acquired one’s own information plays an important role in evaluating and justifying a belief, and deciding how readily it should be discarded (O’neill and Gopnik, 1991).  Recognizing sources of knowledge is so cognitively salient that some languages explicitly mark source syntactically. In languages with evidential marking, such as Turkish, Bulgarian, Tibetan and Quechua, utterances are syntactically marked to indicate how the information was acquired (Aikhenvald, 2004; de Villiers, Garﬁeld, Gernet-Girard, Roeper, & Speas, 2009; Faller, 2002; Fitneva, 2001; Johanson & Utas, 2000; Smirnova, 2013). Some languages mark direct versus indirect experience, or hearsay versus everything else; others mark whether the information was gained from inference, hearsay, or sensory experience. Languages such as Tucano and Fasu  encode aspects of sensory modality, including distinctions between visual versus non-visual sensory information; one language, Kashaya, has a separate marker for auditory evidence (Aikhenvald, 2004). Acquisition of linguistic evidential marking by children appears to depend on the development of theory of mind: during acquisition of Turkish, for example, children’s earlier performance on explicit theory of mind tasks concerning sources of knowledge predict linguistic evidentials, but not vice versa (Papafragou & Li, 2001).  later comprehension of  their  In sum, the source of others’ knowledge is both behaviorally relevant and cognitively salient; the current results suggest that it is also explicitly encoded by distinct neural populations within the TPJ. An open question for future work is whether patterns in the TPJ can distinguish only the modality or also other aspects of another person’s source of knowledge. For example, sources of knowledge can be direct (perceptual observation), inferential (by induction from clues or patterns), or from hearsay (from other people’s report). Direct perceptual sources may be more or less reliable, depending on the situation (e.g. observed from nearby or at a distance, based on a quick glance or a long stare) and the observer (e.g. an expert, an amateur, or a child). Future research should investigate the neural representation of these other features of knowledge source, and the relationship between these features and perceptual source.  4.3. The valence of others’ mental states  In contrast to perceptual source, we failed to decode the valence of another person’s mental experience from the pattern of activity in any theory of mind region. This is especially noteworthy, considering that the behavioral task – judging how good or bad someone felt at the end of the story – speciﬁcally drew attention towards valence, while ignoring source information. However, a prior study successfully decoded positive versus negative valence of others’ emotions, expressed in emotional body movements, facial expressions, and tones of voice, from patterns of activity in MPFC (Peelen, Atkinson, & Vuilleumier, 2010; Skerry & Saxe, in prep). One possibility is that emotional experience is more effectively conveyed in non-verbal stimuli. However, null results from MVPA should be interpreted with caution. The neural sub-populations that respond to different types of valence could be intermingled such that we would be unable to detect the distinct neural populations at the spatial scale of fMRI voxels; the distinction would only be revealed by techniques with higher spatial resolution.  4.4. Blind adults represent knowledge source  We found similar patterns of neural activity in blind and sighted adults. Most notably, we found that other people’s visual versus auditory experiences are encoded distinctly by both sighted and blind adults. Blind individuals speciﬁcally lack ﬁrst person experience of visual aspects of mental states, and thus allow us to test the role of ﬁrst person, sensory experience in the development of theory  J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  75  of mind representation: what does it take to be able to think about someone else’s experience?  One set of theories of how we understand others’ mental experiences posits that we vividly simulate, or imagine, having the same experience ourselves. For example, Gallese and Sinigaglia (2011) describe the process of simulation as: ‘‘People reusing their own mental states or processes in functionally attributing them to others, where the extent and reliability of such reuse and functional attribution depend on the simulator’s bodily resources and their being shared with the target’s bodily resources.’’ (p. 518). That is, we understand other people’s mental states using a template of our own ﬁrst-person experiences. This view is difﬁcult to reconcile with evidence that blind people use similar neural mechanisms to reason about seeing as do sighted people. In the initial analyses of these data, Bedny et al. (2009) showed that blind adults can represent mental states acquired by vision, without additional costs or compensatory mechanisms. The present analyses further show that in these same blind and sighted adults, not only are the same brain regions recruited to think about others’ mental states based on seeing and hearing, but these regions represent the difference between visual and auditory sources of belief. These results suggest the representation of perceptual source in the TPJ is not dependent on ﬁrst-person experience.  actions  yourself  Importantly, however, our data do not show that people never use ﬁrst-person experience to make inferences about other people’s minds and goals. Both in the motor and sensory domains, people do seem to use sensory-motor information to understand other’s actions and experiences. For example, interference between other people’s sensorymotor experience and our own suggests that we use partially shared representations for action observation and action execution. Observing someone else’s actions can interfere with executing (Kilner, Paulignan, & Blakemore, 2003), and observing what another person can see interferes with the ability to report on what you yourself are seeing (Samson, Apperly, Braithwaite, Andrews, & Bodley Scott, 2010). Similarly, personal experience speciﬁcally helps children learn about others’ visual experiences: infants who experienced a transparent blindfold follow the gaze of a blindfolded adult, but infants who experienced an opaque blindfold do not (Meltzoff, 2004; Meltzoff, 2007; Meltzoff & Brooks, 2007). In all, understanding of other minds is likely guided by both ﬁrst-person experience, which provides rich and detailed input about the character of speciﬁc experiences, and an intuitive theory of mind, which allows individuals to form representations of experiences they have not had, and indeed could never have, such as blind adults’ representations of experiences of sight. In some cases, such as action prediction, ﬁrst person sensory machinery may play a direct role in representing information about other people; in other cases, ﬁrst person experience provides a rich source of data about how people feel and act, playing an important role in building causal theories of other’s minds. The best ‘‘theory of mind’’ will both be able to deal with abstract generalizations and make use of data from ﬁrstperson experience (Apperly, 2008; Keysers & Gazzola, 2007; Kilner & Frith, 2007).  4.5. Learning about sight  The present ﬁndings, along with prior evidence, suggest that blind people can have impressively rich knowledge about sight (Landau & Gleitman, 1985; Marmor, n.d.; Shepard & Cooper, 1992). How do blind individuals acquire this extensive knowledge about seeing? We propose that one source of information is others’ testimony. Blind children live immersed in a world of sighted people, who talk constantly about experiences of seeing. In general, children acquire much of their knowledge of the invisible causal structure of the world through testimony (Harris, 2002a,b; Harris & Koenig, 2006; Koenig, Clément, & Harris, 2004). Language and testimony are a particularly powerful tool for learning about the invisible contents of other minds (Bedny & Saxe, 2012; Robinson, Haigh, & Nurmsoo, 2008; Robinson & Whitcombe, 2003; Urwin, 1983); the absence of linguistic access to other minds can signiﬁcantly delay theory of mind development, for example in deaf children born to non-signing parents (de Villiers, 2005; Figueras-Costa & Harris, 2001; Meristo et al., 2007; Moeller & Schick, 2006; Peterson & Siegal, 1999; Peterson & Wellman, 2010; Pyers & Senghas, 2009; Schick, de Villiers, de Villiers, & Hoffmeister, 2007; Woolfe & Want, 2002). In contrast, conversational access seems to give blind children a detailed representation of visual mental states, and the inferences they afford.  The importance of testimony to the understanding of other minds is highlighted by the contrast between how much blind people know about sight and how little sighted people know about blindness. Blind individuals can never directly experience vision, but they are constantly exposed to testimony about seeing. By contrast, sighted people do experience the perceptual aspects of blindness (when in the dark or with their eyes closed). Nevertheless, the average sighted person has little understanding of blindness. Most sighted people do not know how blind individuals navigate their environment or perform daily tasks such as dressing and eating. This lack of knowledge can lead to incorrect and sometimes problematic inferences about blind people’s incapability to work, learn, and parent. Given how much blind people know about seeing, such misunderstandings are unlikely to result from an in principle incapacity to understand experiences different from our own. While blind people are surrounded by sighted people, most sighted individuals have never met anyone who is blind. The ignorance of sighted people is thus another dramatic example of the importance of testimony for learning about other minds.  However, these experiments have just begun to probe sight understanding in blind individuals. In the current stimuli neither the content nor the reliability of the mental states depended on the perceptual modality. The belief content (e.g. ‘‘his team lost’’) was matched across perceptual sources, and always reliably inferred from the perceptual evidence. Thus, successfully encoding the story did not depend on speciﬁc knowledge about sight, e.g., how difﬁcult it is to recognize a face in the dark. It is possible that blind people would show different behavior and neural processes for such inferences. Additionally, participants’ task (judging how good or bad the protagonist would feel)  76  J. Koster-Hale et al. / Cognition 133 (2014) 65–78  depended on encoding the content but not the source of beliefs. Despite this, participants spontaneously encoded the perceptual source of the belief described in the story. However, as a consequence, the current results cannot determine whether blind and sighted people would show similar neural patterns (or behavioral performance) if speciﬁc details about the perceptual source were more relevant in the task. Future research should investigate whether blind and sighted adults have similar knowledge and representations of the details of sight, such as how knowledge based on vision will vary with distance, occlusion, and darkness, and whether the neural patterns observed here encode similar information about seeing and hearing. Such speciﬁc details may show greater inﬂuences of ﬁrst person experiences.  Finally, while the data here suggest a common endpoint in the development of an adult theory of mind, the processes by which blind and sighted children acquire this theory may be different. Although blind adults appear to have typical theory of mind, blind children are delayed on a variety of theory of mind tasks, including both tasks that rely directly on inferences about vision, such as perspective taking tasks (Bigelow, 1991, 1992; Millar, 1976), and also tasks that do not depend directly on visual perspective, including auditory versions of the false belief task (McAlpine & Moore, 1995; Minter & Hobson, 1998; Peterson and Webb, 2000). Using a battery of theory of mind tasks designed speciﬁcally for blind children, Brambring and Asbrock (2010) concluded that blind children are delayed an average of 1–2 years, relative to blindfolded sighted control children, though these children catch up in adolescence (see Peterson & Wellman, 2010 for a similar argument about deaf children). Thus an open question is whether the neural mechanisms for theory of mind, which are similar in blind and sighted adults, develop differently in blind and sighted children.  5. Conclusion  In summary, we ﬁnd that (i) theory of mind brain regions (speciﬁcally, the TPJ) encode perceptual source and sensory modality of others’ mental states, and (ii) these representations are preserved in the RTPJ of congenitally blind adults. Considerable neuroimaging work on theory of mind suggests that the RTPJ plays a role in thinking about others’ thoughts; we ﬁnd that one aspect of this role is to make explicit, in the population response of its neurons, features of beliefs – in this case, the perceptual source of the belief. The persistence of these representations in congenitally blind adults provides evidence that theory of mind brain regions come to encode these aspects of mental states even in the absence of ﬁrst-person experience.

Although reviews and meta-analyses of these studies have concluded that ToM recruits a coherent brain network, mounting evidence suggests that this network is an abstraction based on pooling data from numerous studies, most of which use different behavioral tasks to investigate ToM. Problematically, this means that no single behavioral task can be used to reliably measure ToM Network function as currently conceived. To make ToM Network function scientiﬁcally tractable, we need standardized tasks capable of reliably measuring speciﬁc aspects of its functioning. Here, our goal is to validate the Why/How Task for this purpose. Several prior studies have found that when compared to answering how-questions about another person's behavior, answering why-questions about that same behavior activates a network that is anatomically consistent with meta-analytic deﬁnitions of the ToM Network. In the version of the Why/How Task presented here, participants answer yes/no Why (e.g., Is the person helping someone?) and How (e.g., Is the person lifting something?) questions about pretested photographs of naturalistic human behaviors. Across three fMRI studies, we show that the task elicits reliable performance measurements and modulates a left-lateralized network that is consistently localized across studies. While this network is convergent with meta-analyses of ToM studies, it is largely distinct from the network identiﬁed by the widely used False-Belief Localizer, the most common ToM task. Our new task is publicly available, and can be used as an efﬁcient functional localizer to provide reliable identiﬁcation of singlesubject responses in most regions of the network. Our results validate the Why/How Task, both as a standardized protocol capable of producing maximally comparable data across studies, and as a ﬂexible foundation for programmatic research on the neurobiological foundations of a basic manifestation of human ToM.  © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  Problems with prior research  Human social cognition makes constant use of a Theory of Mind (ToM), an ability that encompasses conceiving of behavior as driven by unobservable mental states, and appreciating that the mental states of others may differ from one's own (Apperly, 2012; Dennett, 1989; Gopnik and Wellman, 1992; Leslie et al., 2004; Premack and Woodruff, 1978; Wellman et al., 2001). This ability is likely necessary for survival in a complex social world, is thought to be severely impaired in numerous psychopathologies (e.g., autism), and may be unique to humans in degree if not in kind (Kennedy and Adolphs, 2012). Moreover, hundreds of neuroimaging studies have already examined the correlates of ToM in the human brain. Collectively, these studies suggest that the use of ToM is reliably associated with a set of regions now commonly known as the ToM Network. The present studies were motivated by two interrelated problems facing neuroimaging studies on ToM.  ⁎ Corresponding author.  E-mail addresses: spunt@caltech.edu (R.P. Spunt), radolphs@caltech.edu (R. Adolphs).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.05.023 1053-8119/© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  The ﬁrst problem is a signiﬁcant lack of standardized tasks for investigating speciﬁc uses of ToM. As noted by numerous meta-analyses, the hundreds of neuroimaging studies of ToM feature enormous variability in the manner by which ToM is operationally deﬁned (Carrington and Bailey, 2009; Denny et al., 2012; Lieberman, 2010; Mar, 2011; Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009). This is not surprising: The broad ability called ToM spans the ﬂexible use of a wide range of mental representations (e.g., belief vs. desire) to understand a diverse array of stimuli (e.g., verbal vs. nonverbal) in the service of a variety of goals (e.g., deception vs. empathic understanding). For example, many neuroimaging studies have investigated ToM through the lens of the false-belief localizer (Saxe et al., 2004), which requires participants to comprehend verbal narratives and make a prediction about a character's future behavior based on a representation of their belief. Other neuroimaging studies have investigated ToM through a different lens, using simple nonverbal geometric animations (Heider and Simmel, 1944) to evoke inferences about motive and intent (e.g., Schultz et al., 2003). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the one empirical study to formally compare these two tasks concluded that they modulate largely distinct neural systems  302  R.P. Spunt, R. Adolphs / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 301–311  (Gobbini et al., 2007). This is not itself problematic, since it is natural to expect that a cognitive construct as broad and complex as ToM would be decomposable into multiple distinct processes, each of which would require a distinct methodology to investigate scientiﬁcally. Importantly, programmatic scientiﬁc research necessitates the existence of standardized protocols that are generally accepted by the research community (or in the least multiple research groups) as a valid, reliable, and distinctive operational deﬁnition of a theoretical construct. In the absence of such protocols, ﬁndings of different studies are often extremely difﬁcult to compare, even if those studies claim to be investigating the same theoretical construct. Ultimately, this impedes scientiﬁc progress by preventing cumulative research.  An adverse consequence of a lack of standardization is illustrated by the second problem this study aims to help address: anatomical delineations of the ToM Network remain imprecise. The regions included in the deﬁnition of the network vary across different literature reviews, and even large meta-analyses that include hundreds of studies fail to converge on a precise deﬁnition (Carrington and Bailey, 2009; Denny et al., 2012; Lieberman, 2010; Mar, 2011; Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009). When convergence does occur, it is often explained by the fact that the labels used to deﬁne the regions of the network are themselves anatomically imprecise. For instance, the labels used to deﬁne the two regions most reliably associated with ToM – the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) – can both be used to refer to large areas of cortex that are known to exhibit both structural and functional heterogeneities. Because of this, the same label is often used to report areas of activation that are clearly different; this, in turn, blurs out potentially meaningful distinctions at both the neural and cognitive levels of analysis. In sum, the search for a single network in the human brain subserving ToM is probably misguided.  The value of standardization  Methodological variability must be balanced with methodological standardization, because only with the latter is programmatic research possible. This can be illustrated with reference to the single currently standardized protocol for investigating the neural bases of ToM. This is the False-Belief Localizer (often referred to, in fact, as the Theory-ofMind Localizer) developed by Rebecca Saxe and colleagues (Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003; Saxe and Powell, 2006). The task uses brief verbal narratives to manipulate the demand to represent another person's false belief about reality. Two types of verbal narratives are contrasted to isolate the neural bases of representing false-belief: Stories in which a character comes to have a false belief about the world, and stories in which a physical record of the world (e.g.,. a photograph, map, or painting) becomes outdated or misleading. Compared to False-Photograph stories, False-Belief stories reliably evoke an increased response in a set of brain regions that are anatomically similar to the putative ToM Network. In fact, these regions can be reliably localized in individual participants using an empirically validated version of the protocol that takes less than 10 min to run and is publicly available (Dodell-feder et al., 2011). Given the consistency of the basic operational deﬁnition across studies, it is now reasonable to aggregate data across numerous studies in order to establish reliability and produce an empirical distribution against which new data can be evaluated. By using such an empirical distribution, Dufour et al. (2013) recently demonstrated that a small sample of adults with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) showed a response to the Belief N Photo contrast that was within normal ranges. Given the programmatic nature of research using the Belief N Photo contrast to probe ToM Network function, this ﬁnding has clear implications for past and future research using a version of the Belief N Photo contrast. Critically, this is not because researchers have and will likely continue to share an interest in ToM; rather, what is critical is that researchers have and will likely continue to share an operational deﬁnition of ToM and to use consistently a particular localizer task. Without such a  common ground, the ﬁndings from different studies are often difﬁcult and sometimes impossible to compare.  Motivation for the present studies  Without standardized protocols for generating a body of data that is comparable across studies, programmatic research is virtually impossible. Unfortunately, the False-Belief Localizer is at present the only standardized protocol for manipulating a use of ToM and probing its underlying brain systems. Here, we follow the example it sets by introducing and validating a standardized contrast for investigating the human ability to explain behavior (Heider, 1958; Jones and Davis, 1965; Kelley, 1973). In prior work, we have investigated the neural correlates of this ability by instructing subjects to freely think of answers to why-questions about observable human behaviors. In a second condition, participants observe the same behaviors, but instead think of answers to how-questions about those behaviors. Across several studies examining variants of this attentional manipulation, we have observed that the Why N How contrast evokes a response in a set of brain regions that, like the Photo N Belief contrast, shows a high degree of qualitative correspondence with metaanalytically and review-based deﬁnitions of the ToM Network (Spunt and Lieberman, 2012a,b, 2013; Spunt et al., 2010, 2011).  The present study was motivated to validate and standardize a novel implementation of this contrast that signiﬁcantly improves upon past research. In light of the problems identiﬁed above, our central aim was not to make a theoretical contribution, but a methodological one. There is no poverty of theory about what ToM entails, but there remains a signiﬁcant poverty of validated methods for manipulating ToM in the context of a neuroimaging experiment. In Study 1, we introduce the method for achieving the Why/How contrast and present its behavioral and neural effects. In Study 2, we evaluate the test–retest reliability of the Why/How contrast in the same participants, and formally compare it to the Belief/Photo contrast obtained in the commonly used FalseBelief Localizer in order to establish its discriminant validity. In Study 3, we introduce an efﬁcient version of the new Why/How contrast and make this publicly available for use in neuroimaging research on ToM.  Study 1  Materials and methods  Participants  Participants were twenty-nine right-handed adults (19 males, 10 females; mean age = 27.10, age range = 19–38), all native Englishspeaking citizens of the United States. Each participant was neurologically and psychiatrically healthy, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, spoke English ﬂuently, had IQ in the normal range (as assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence), and was not pregnant or taking any psychotropic medications. Each participant provided written informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the California Institute of Technology, and received ﬁnancial compensation for participating.  Yes/No Why/How Task  The version of the Why/How contrast (Fig. 1) introduced here builds on the ﬁrst author's previous work investigating the human brain regions associated with answering Why and How questions about human behavior (Spunt and Lieberman, 2012a,b, 2013; Spunt et al., 2010, 2011). Participants in these prior studies spontaneously and silently generated their own responses to these questions. Although this elicitation method features high ecological validity, it comes at a cost of experimental control and performance measurement. To address this limitation, we designed a version of the task that manipulates attention to “why” versus “how” by having participants answer pre-tested yes/no questions about naturalistic human behaviors shown in photographs. This provides a behavioral measure of both accuracy and  R.P. Spunt, R. Adolphs / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 301–311  303  Fig. 1. Design of the Yes/No Why/How Task. (A) Examples of four blocks created by pairing either a question about motive (why) or implementation (how) with a set of photographs featuring either intentional actions or emotional expressions. Independently acquired normative data is used to ensure that every photo selected has an unambiguous (i.e., consensus) response. In the example blocks shown, the photographs outlined in red elicited a consensus response of ‘no’, while the remaining photographs elicited a consensus response of ‘yes’. (B) Schematic showing the task timing. Each block begins with question presentation, and is followed by a set of photographs paired with that question. Between each photograph is a brief reminder of the question for that block. For each photograph, participants have 1750 ms to respond. If they fail to respond by that time, the task advances. Responding before the end of the 1750 ms ends the trial and advances to the next trial. Hence, block durations were contingent on response times. However, total task duration was not, as block onsets were ﬁxed. As described in the main text, the versions of the Yes/No Why/How Task used in Studies 2 and 3 featured only trivial differences to what is presented here, which corresponds to the version used in Study 1.  response time, which can be used to validate that participants are in fact performing the task, as well as to explore individual differences and further associations of behavioral performance variability with brain activation. As in the original Why/How task, each photograph appears twice, once as the object of a question designed to focus attention on why it is being performed, and once as the object of a question designed to focus attention on how it is being performed.  The ﬁnal set of photographs featured 42 photographs of familiar actions of the hand, and 42 photographs of familiar facial expressions. Table 1 displays the 24 questions featured in the study, broken down by condition (Why vs. How) and behavior category (Hand Actions vs. Facial Expressions). Each question was paired with 4 photographs designed to elicit the response ‘yes’, and 3 photographs designed to elicit the response ‘no’. These pairings were selected based on the responses of an independent sample of respondents recruited through Amazon.com's web service Mechanical Turk. Each pairing was evaluated by at least 25 native English speaking U.S. citizens. We selected question–photo pairs with answers that elicited a consensus of at least 80.00% across participants. The average consensus of the ﬁnal stimulus was 93.66% (SD = 6.37%) and did not differ significantly across the experimental manipulation of Why versus How.  During MRI scanning, items were presented to participants in blocks of 7 corresponding to each of the 24 questions (Fig. 1). The order of question-blocks was optimized to maximize the efﬁciency of estimating the Why N How contrast. This was achieved by generating the design matrices for one million pseudo-randomly generated orders, and for each calculating the efﬁciency of estimating the contrast of the regressors corresponding to Why and How question blocks. The two most efﬁcient orders were retained, and one was randomly assigned to each participant. Prior to performing the Why/How localizer, participants were told they would be performing a “Photograph Judgment Test” in which they would answer yes/no questions about photographs of people. They were then shown two example trials and were invited to ask the experimenter questions if they did not fully understand the task. Finally, they were told that they would have a limited amount of time to respond to each photograph, and that if they were not sure about any answer, they should make their best guess. Total runtime of the task was 7 min, 5 s (Fig. 1 provides details for the timing of trials).  Stimulus presentation and response recording  In all three studies, stimulus presentation and response recording was achieved using the Psychophysics Toolbox (version 3.0.9; Brainard, 1997)  Table 1 The questions used in the Yes/No Why/How Task to manipulate and measure attention to “why” versus “how” for actions and expressions.

Participants made their responses using their right hand index and middle ﬁngers on a button box.  Image acquisition  All imaging data were acquired at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center using a Siemens Trio 3.0 Tesla MRI Scanner outﬁtted with a 32 channel phased-array headcoil. We acquired 170 T2*-weighted echoplanar image volumes (EPIs; slice thickness = 3 mm, 47 slices, TR = 2500 ms, TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 85°, matrix = 64 × 64, FOV = 192 mm). Moreover, we also acquired a high-resolution anatomical T1-weighted image (1 mm isotropic) and ﬁeld maps for each participant.  Image analysis  Functional data were analyzed using a combination of custom code and the MATLAB-based software package Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Prior to statistical analysis, the ﬁrst two EPI volumes from each run were discarded to account for T1 equilibration, and the remaining volumes were subjected to the following preprocessing steps: (1) each EPI volume was realigned to the ﬁrst EPI volume of the run and simultaneously unwarped based on the ﬁeldmap volumes; (2) the T1 structural volume was co-registered to the mean EPI; (3) the groupwise DARTEL registration method included in SPM8 (Ashburner, 2007) was used to normalize the T1 structural volume to a common group-speciﬁc space (with subsequent afﬁne registration to MNI space); and (4) normalization of all EPI volumes to MNI space using the deformation ﬂow ﬁelds generated in the previous step, which simultaneously re-sampled volumes (2 mm isotropic) and applied spatial smoothing (Gaussian kernel of 6 × 6 × 6 mm, full width at half maximum).  Single-subject effects were estimated using a General Linear Model. The hemodynamic response was modeled using the canonical (doublegamma) response function, and the predicted and actual signals were high-pass ﬁltered at 0.01 Hz. As covariates of no interest, all models included the 6 motion parameter estimates from image realignment, and regressors indicating timepoints where in-brain global signal change (GSC) exceeded 2.5 SDs of the mean GSC or where estimated motion exceeds 0.5 mm of translation or 0.5 degrees of rotation. Finally, all models were estimated using the robust weighted least-squares algorithm implemented in the SPM8 RobustWLS toolbox (Diedrichsen and Shadmehr, 2005).  Each single-subject model included effects for the two conditions of interest: Why and How. Conditions were modeled as variable epochs (Grinband et al., 2008), with each epoch spanning onset of the ﬁrst photograph of each block to the offset of the ﬁnal photograph. In addition to the covariates of no interest described above, three additional parametric regressors were included. The ﬁrst modeled variation in the type of behavior (action vs. expression) shown in the photographs across all blocks (a variable of no interest for the present study). The second modeled variation in the total accuracy of the responses within each block and ensures that the Why/How contrast is not confounded with performance accuracy. The third modeled the variation in the total duration of each block (effectively modeling any RT differences, since it was self-paced) and ensures that the Why/How contrast is not confounded with time on task. As we describe below, we include additional analyses in the Supplementary Materials that conﬁrm that performance-related variability does not provide a sufﬁcient explanation of the effects observed in the Why/How contrast.  To investigate the group-level effects, a single image for each participant representing the contrast of the Why and How conditions was entered into a second-level one-sample t-test. The resulting t-statistic image was corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) rate of .05 with a cluster-forming threshold of p b .001. In Table 2, we report only those peaks that survive a voxel-level FWE rate of .05.  Table 2 Group-level results of the Why/How contrast from Study 1 (N = 29).

We computed the minimum statistic image from the group-level t-statistic images for the Why N How comparison in each study.  Results  Performance  For the Why/How Localizer, participants were signiﬁcantly more accurate in their responses when answering How (M = 96.47%, SD = 2.73%) compared to Why (M = 93.39%, SD = 3.88%) questions, t(28) = 3.671, p = .001, 95% CI [1.361, 4.797]. In addition, participants were faster when answering How (M = 794 ms, SD = 112 ms) compared to Why (M = 909 ms, SD = 122 ms) questions, t(28) = 12.366, p b .001, 95% CI [96, 135]. Remarkably, all participants demonstrated this RT effect, responding faster to How compared to Why questions.  These data demonstrate that the Why/How contrast is reliably associated with two performance-related effects: Compared to How questions, Why questions elicit lower response accuracy and longer response times (RT). Importantly, we estimated the Why/How contrast using models that simultaneously modeled variance explained by accuracy and latency. In addition to incorporating RT and accuracy into our regression model in the main analyses presented below, we further conﬁrmed that performance-related variability cannot explain the neural responses typically observed in the Why/How contrast, by conducting a secondary set of analyses, which we report in detail in the Supplementary Materials. Brieﬂy, we estimated two additional models for each participant. The ﬁrst modeled the Why/How contrast across high-accuracy  R.P. Spunt, R. Adolphs / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 301–311  305  Why questions and low-accuracy How questions, such that Why questions elicited signiﬁcantly higher accuracy rates than did How questions. The second modeled the Why/How contrast across the Why questions eliciting the fastest RTs and the How questions eliciting the slowest RTs, such that Why questions elicited signiﬁcantly faster RTs than did How questions. As listed in Table S2, both analyses strongly replicate the results presented below, demonstrating that performance variability cannot explain the effects reported here.  Brain regions modulated by the Why/How contrast  The Why N How contrast isolated a largely left-lateralized set of cortical regions that are anatomically consistent with meta-analytic deﬁnitions of the ToM Network (Fig. 2A) and with the regions observed in our published studies that used an open-answer response protocol to achieve the Why N How contrast for intentional actions and emotional facial expressions (Fig. 2B; Spunt and Lieberman, 2012a,b). These regions span dorsomedial, ventromedial, and lateral orbital areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC); a medial parietal area spanning the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/PC); the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ); and the anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS) bilaterally (Table 2). In addition, we observed a right-lateralized response in the posterior lobe of the cerebellum that is also consistent with our prior work as well as a recently published meta-analysis demonstrating reliable cerebellar responses to higher-order social cognition (Van Overwalle et al., 2013).  As also listed in Table 2, the How N Why comparison isolated a set of cortical regions including an area of the left lateral occipital cortex and left superior parietal lobule, as well as several other areas of the parietal lobe bilaterally, including the intraparietal sulcus, supramarginal gyrus, and dorsal precuneus.  Study 2  Study 1 introduced a novel implementation of the Why/How contrast that overcomes the central limitation of the version used in our  previous research, which relied on covert answers to open-ended questions (Spunt and Lieberman, 2012a,b, 2013; Spunt et al., 2010, 2011). The resulting task produces functional contrast in a set of brain regions that converge both with those observed using the original Why/How Task and with meta-analytical deﬁnitions of the ToM Network (Fig. 2). The primary motivation of Study 2 was to determine the extent to which the Why/How contrast is distinct when compared to the Belief/ Photo contrast provided by the False-Belief Localizer (Dodell-feder et al., 2011; Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003; Saxe and Powell, 2006), which remains the only existing standardized contrast for investigating the neural correlates of ToM. To perform the comparison, we capitalized on the fact that a subset of the participants in Study 1 had earlier participated in a separate fMRI study, which included both the False-Belief Localizer as well as an earlier version of the Yes/No Why/How Task used in Study 1. This allowed us to evaluate the dissimilarity of the Belief/Photo and Why/How contrasts in the same set of participants. If we ﬁnd that the responses produced by the Why/How contrast are dissimilar from those produced by the Belief/Photo contrast, then the former can be said to feature high discriminant validity, a desirable psychometric property for novel test instruments (Campbell, 1960; Campbell and Fiske, 1959).  Materials and methods  Participants  The data used in the present study was collected as part of a larger study (currently unpublished) that featured a subset of ten of the participants from Study 1 (6 males, 4 females; mean age = 26.50, age range = 21–38), and the procedures for recruiting, screening, consenting, and compensating them were identical to those used in Study 1 (the average amount of time between Study 1 and the present study was 30.33 days). This study included a single fMRI session that included an earlier version of the Yes/No Why/How Task used in Study 1  Fig. 2.

Spunt, R. Adolphs / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 301–311  (differences described below) and the publicly available version of the False-Belief Localizer (Dodell-Feder et al., 2011).  Why/How contrast  As noted above, the version of the Yes/No Why/How Task differed in several ways from the one introduced in Study 1. These differences were motivated by the speciﬁc questions being investigated in the larger study for which it was designed. First, in addition to the two categories of social behavior featured in Study 1 (intentional actions and emotional expression), this version featured why- and how-questions about a third stimulus category showing the effects of non-social processes, for instance, scenes showing the consequences of extreme weather. The comparison of social to non-social stimuli is outside the scope of the present report and will not be discussed further. Second, the blocks for this version each included nine rather than seven trials. Third, this version featured a small number of differences in the speciﬁc question–photograph pairs used to achieve the Why/How manipulation. All questions are provided in Table S1. Finally, there were small differences in the timing of the trial elements within each block, and with the average stimulus onset asynchrony. In light of these differences combined with the nonsocial Why/How condition, this version had a total runtime of 16 min, 35 s.  False-Belief Localizer  Participants performed the most recent version of the publicly available False-Belief Localizer (Dodell-feder et al., 2011; http://saxelab.mit. edu/tomloc.zip, version Sept. 7, 2011). Given that the task has been described extensively elsewhere, we only brieﬂy describe it here. The contrast is formed by comparing two conditions, both of which involve reading a short story and judging the veracity of brief statement about the events described in the story. Belief stories describe the events that lead one or more characters to form a false belief about the world, while Photo stories describe the events that lead a physical representation of the world (e.g., a photograph, map, or sign) to become outdated or misleading. Henceforth, we refer to the comparison of these conditions as the Belief/Photo contrast. Although we made no changes to the original stimuli, we modiﬁed the timing of the task so that presentation durations were self-paced within a ﬁxed time window. Prior to performing the task, participants were shown an example trial and were invited to ask questions before beginning. Total run time of the task was 8 min, 50 s.  Image acquisition  Image acquisition parameters differed only in the number of EPI volumes acquired for each task: 398 volumes were acquired for the Why/How contrast, while 212 volumes were acquired for the Belief/ Photo contrast.  Image analysis  The image preprocessing pipeline was identical to the one used in Study 1. Why/How model speciﬁcation differed only in the inclusion of covariates of no interest modeling responses to the non-social stimulus category. The model for the False-Belief Localizer task included effects for the two conditions of interest: Belief and Photo. Each trial was modeled as a variable epoch spanning the onset of Story presentation and the offset of the Judgment period. In addition to the nuisance covariates of no interest described in the methods of Study 1, we also included a single parametric regressor modeling the total duration of each block. This regressor ensures that the Belief N Photo contrast is not confounded with time on task.  To evaluate the claim that the Why/How contrast is distinct from the Belief/Photo contrast, we compared their group-level activation maps. To test for common areas of activation, we used their minimum statistic to test the conjunction null (Nichols et al., 2005). To test for statistically different levels of activation, we entered participants' contrast images for the effects of each condition for both tasks into a single, random effects analysis using a ﬂexible factorial repeated-measures ANOVA (within-subject factors: Why/How task, condition; blocking factor: subject). Within this model, we tested the Task-by-Condition interaction to determine regions that are differentially modulated in the two contrasts.  To supplement these univariate analyses, we employed an analytical strategy known as representational similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008) in order to evaluate the similarity structure of the multivariate patterns of activity that characterize the Why/How and Belief/Photo contrasts. Activity patterns were extracted from a mask of voxels showing a preferential association with prior neuroimaging studies of theory-of-mind and mentalizing. To create the mask, we used the automated meta-analysis tool Neurosynth (Yarkoni et al., 2011; http:// neurosynth.org/features) to download a reverse inference map that shows the likelihood that the term “mentalizing” was used in a study if activation was reported at a particular voxel. We used the term “mentalizing” because (a) it is used interchangeably with the phrase “Theory of Mind”, and (b) Neurosynth does not currently offer a map for the phrase “Theory of Mind”. When creating the mask, we included only those clusters larger than 75 voxels. Neurosynth was used to deﬁne our reference mask for three reasons. First, it is the most unbiased method available, based entirely on automated text mining of 5809 published neuroimaging articles. Two, it is the most transparent method available, in that the data is publicly available for download. Finally, it produces a map that is consistent with published meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies of ToM (Carrington and Bailey, 2009; Denny et al., 2012; Mar, 2011; Schurz et al., 2014; Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009). For each of the 10 participants, we extracted the t-statistic values within the mentalizing mask from the voxels achieving threshold in the previously described Why/How contrast estimated in the same session; the same Why/How contrast estimated in a second session; and their Belief/Photo contrast itself. Each of these sets of voxels could then be considered as a vector, and were correlated. The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient thus quantiﬁed, for each participant, the consistency of the multivariate activity patterns across the three contrasts. We then used a paired samples t-test on the Fisher z-transformed correlations to verify that the two Why/How contrasts were more similar to one another than either were to the belief/photo contrasts. We represented the similarity structure in two ways (Figs. 3B and C). Fig. 3B shows a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) showing the degree of pairwise dissimilarity among the three contrasts estimated for each of the ten participants: the Why/How contrast from Study 1 (rows/ columns 1–10; Why/HowS1); the same contrast from an earlier study (rows/columns 11–20; Why/HowS2); and the Belief/Photo contrast (rows/columns 21–30). The dissimilarity measure used is 1 minus the Pearson correlation (r) and ranges from 0 (perfect correlation) to 2 (perfect anti-correlation). Because the order of participants is the same across the three blocks of contrasts, the diagonals within each block represent within-subject pattern dissimilarities, while the offdiagonals represent between-subject dissimilarities. Also shown in Fig. 3C is a two dimensional representation of the similarity structure based on applying multidimensional scaling to the RDM. Each colored circle represents a single contrast image, and contrast images for the same participant are connected by dotted lines. The length of these lines corresponds to the dissimilarity of the multivariate patterns.  Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all analyses were interrogated using a cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) rate of .05 with a clusterforming voxel-level p-value of .001. For visual presentation, thresholded t-statistic maps are overlaid on the average of the participants' T1weighted anatomical images.  Results  Performance  For the Why/How Task, participants were again slightly more accurate in their responses when answering How (M = 92.59%, SD = 5.15%)  R.P. Spunt, R.

(B) Comparison of the multivariate (multivoxel) response patterns produced by the Why/How and Belief/Photo contrasts within the meta-analytically deﬁned regions of the Theory-of-Mind Network shown in Fig. 2a. This panel uses a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) to visualize the degree of pairwise dissimilarity among the response patterns produced by the three contrasts estimated for each of the ten participants: the Why/How contrast from Study 1 (rows/columns 1–10; Why/HowS1); the Why/How contrast from Study 2 (rows/columns 11–20; Why/HowS2); and the Belief/Photo contrast (rows/columns 21–30). The dissimilarity metric is 1 minus the Pearson correlation (r), where a value of 0 indicates perfect correlation; 1 indicates non-correlation; and 2 indicates perfect anti-correlation. Because the order of participants is constant across the three blocks of contrasts, the diagonals within each block represent within-subject pattern dissimilarities, while the off-diagonals represent between-subject dissimilarities.

In addition, participants were faster when answering How (M = 831 ms, SD = 128 ms) compared to Why (M = 901 ms, SD = 117 ms) questions, t(9) = 4.851, p = .001, 95% CI [37, 102]. This replicates the behavioral effects observed in Study 1.  For the False-Belief Localizer, accuracy did not differ across the Belief (M = 73%, SD = 21.108%) and Photo (M = 76%, SD = 15.056%) conditions, t(9) = −.758, p = .468. Similarly, response time (Story onset to Judgment) did not differ across the Belief (M = 14.381 s, SD = 3.42 s) and Photo (M = 13.608 s, SD = 3.812 s) conditions, t(9) = 1.719, p = .120. Despite the lack of differences across the conditions, the neuroimaging analysis of the False-Belief Localizer presented below control for variability in trial duration using the same procedures used in the analysis of the Why/How Task data.  Finally, we determine the extent to which performance was correlated across the three tasks. Although accuracy to Why trials was positively correlated across the two versions of the Why/How Task, r(8) = 0.670, p = 0.034, 95% CI [0.070, 0.914], neither was positively correlated with accuracy for Belief trials in the False-Belief Localizer (ps N .589). Similarly, although accuracy for How trials was positively correlated across the two versions of the Why/How Task, r(8) = 0.706, p = 0.022, 95% CI [0.138, 0.925], neither was positively correlated with accuracy for Photo trials in the False-Belief Localizer (ps N .641). This provides behavioral evidence for discriminant validity in the behavior being measured by the two tasks.  Comparison of the Why/How and Belief/Photo contrasts  Table 3 lists the results of the comparison of the Why/How and Belief/Photo contrasts. Only two regions were observed to be jointly activated by both tasks: left temporoparietal junction and posterior cingulate cortex. Of the total number of voxels activated above threshold by each contrast, this common activity accounted for only 11% and 9% in the Why/How and Belief/Photo contrasts, respectively. Moreover, when statistically comparing the magnitude of the two contrasts, a clear pattern emerges: whereas medial and orbital prefrontal regions responded to Why/How more so than to belief/photo, medial parietal and temporoparietal regions responded to belief/photo more so than to Why/How.  The above shows that the two tasks differ in the magnitude of the response in the putative ToM Network. Next, we examined the extent  to which they differ in the patterns of spatially distributed activity evoked in an independently deﬁned mask of regions associated with mental state inference in prior work as identiﬁed by the automated meta-analysis tool Neurosyth (Yarkoni et al., 2011). If the Why/How contrast produces a pattern of activity that diverges from the one produced by the Belief/Photo contrast, each participant's Why/How contrast should show a pattern of activity that is more similar to a previous Why/How contrast than to their Belief/Photo contrast. To evaluate differences in the pairwise similarities across the three contrasts, we used the Fisher's z-transformed Pearson correlation of the multivariate response pattern across the ToM Network mask. Whereas we observed no evidence for a correlation of the Why/How and Belief/ Photo contrasts (rmean = 0.02, rsd = 0.17), such a correlation was apparent across the two versions of the Why/How contrast (rmean = 0.72, rsd = 0.20), and the difference between these two sets of correlations was signiﬁcant, t(9) = 7.091, p b 0.001, 95% CI [0.478, 0.926]. Fig. 3B represents each participants' response pattern in two-dimensions using multidimensional scaling.

Study 3  The purpose of Study 3 was threefold. First, we sought to validate a more efﬁcient version of the Why/How Task by eliminating questions and photographs that did not elicit high response consensus in Study 1. Second, we sought to demonstrate in a new group of participants the reproducibility of the behavioral and neural effects observed in Studies 1 and 2. Third, we sought to demonstrate the feasibility of using the optimized Why/How Task, which has a total runtime of just 5 min, as a localizer task for deﬁning functional ROIs in individual participants.  Materials and methods  Participants  • Participants were a completely new set of twenty-one right-handed adults (10 males, 11 females; mean age = 27.62, age range = 19–38) recruited from the greater Los Angeles area. The procedures for recruiting, screening, consenting, and compensating these participants were identical to those used in Studies 1 and 2.  Why/How contrast  The version of the Why/How Task employed here was identical to the one used in Study 1 except for the following changes, all of which were intended to reduce the total runtime of the task. The total number of question blocks was reduced to 16 (see Table 1), and the number of photographs per block was increased to 8. Based on the pilot data used to select the items included in Study 1, for each block the consensus response was ‘yes’ for 5 photos and ‘no’ for the remaining 3. In addition, we introduced minor modiﬁcations to the timing of the task as depicted in Fig. 1. These modiﬁcations were justiﬁed by observation from Study 1 that participants were not only quite efﬁcient (mean RT ranged from 574 to 1141 ms) but exhibited near-ceiling accuracy rates (mean accuracy ranged from 86 to 100%). Collectively, these changes yielded a version of the task with a total runtime of 5 min, 12 s. The stimuli and MATLAB code for presenting and scoring the task can be downloaded at http://www.bobspunt.com/whyhow-localizer/.  Image acquisition  Image acquisition procedures differed only in the use of a multiband excitation sequence to acquire 3212 EPI volumes (acceleration factor = 4; slice thickness = 2.5 mm, 56 slices, TR = 1000 ms, TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 60°, matrix = 80 × 80, FOV = 200 mm).  Image analysis  Image preprocessing and model speciﬁcation aspects of the analysis  pipeline were identical to those described in Studies 1 and 2.  Results  Performance  We replicate the behavioral effects observed in Studies 1 and 2: Participants were more accurate in their responses when answering How (M = 95.76%, SD = 3.17%) compared to Why (M = 91.96%, SD = 3.93%) questions, t(20) = 3.302, p = .004, 95% CI [−6.192, − 1.398]. In addition, participants were faster when answering How (M = 611 ms, SD = 87 ms) compared to Why (M = 686 ms, SD = 108 ms) questions, t(20) = 5.625, p b .001, 95% CI [47, 102].  Brain regions modulated by the Why/How contrast  As shown in Fig. 2D and listed in Table 4, a whole-brain search conﬁrmed that the 5-minute version of the Why/How Task continues to  Reliability of single-subject localization  Finally, we sought evidence pertaining to the feasibility of using the 5-minute version of the Why/How Task as a localizer of functional ROIs in individual participants For each region identiﬁed in the whole-brain contrast, we determined the percentage of participants for which a cluster of at least 10 voxel extent could be identiﬁed after thresholding each participants' single-subject Why/How contrast using a cluster-level family-wise error rate of .05. As shown in Table 4, this criterion allowed us to detect activity in most regions in at least 80% of participants. This was true for regions both activated or deactivated in the Why N How contrast. This demonstrates the inter-subject consistency of the Why/ How contrast, and validates its use as an efﬁcient functional localizer. As described above, we have made this version of the task publicly available under the name Why/How Localizer.  Functional lateralization  As described in more detail in the Supplementary Materials, we used the pooled data from Study 1 and the present study (N = 50) to determine the extent to which the degree of lateralization present in the Why N How contrast is statistically reliable. This is motivated by the second problem identiﬁed in the Introduction, namely, that anatomical deﬁnitions of the ToM Network remain imprecise. If the regions associated with the Why N How contrast show a response that is reliably lateralized, this would further increase the precision of its anatomical deﬁnition. The results of this analysis are listed in Table S3: the network evoked by the Why/How localizer was strongly left-lateralized. Of all the cortical regions associated with the Why N How contrast, only the posterior cingulate cortex failed to show left hemisphere selectivity. The single region to show evidence of right hemisphere selectivity was in the posterior lobe of the cerebellum.  Discussion  Taken together, the three studies presented here validate the Why/ How contrast for functional MRI studies of ToM. In Study 1, we introduced an improved protocol for achieving the Why/How contrast and showed that it activates a largely left-lateralized network that converges both with our prior work (Spunt and Lieberman, 2012a,b, 2013; Spunt et al., 2010, 2011) and with meta-analytic deﬁnitions of the ToM Network. In Study 2, we showed that within the same set of participants, the network activated by the Why/How contrast is reliable across testing sessions, and is clearly distinct from the network activated by the only existing standardized protocol for investigating the neural bases of using ToM, the False-Belief Localizer (Dodell-feder et al., 2011; Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003). In Study 3, we showed that the network is reproducible in a completely new group of participants, demonstrated the feasibility of using the new Why/How protocol as an efﬁcient functional localizer at the single-subject level. Finally, across all studies, we found that the new Why/How Task yields reliable behavioral effects. Taken together, these ﬁndings validate a novel instrument for manipulating a distinct use of ToM and assessing both its behavioral and neural correlates.  We believe that this instrument helps solve the two problems with previous neuroimaging work on ToM that were identiﬁed in the Introduction. The ﬁrst problem regarded the fact that despite the enormous number of studies that have been devoted to investigating the neural bases of different uses of ToM (Carrington and Bailey, 2009; Denny et al., 2012; Lieberman, 2010; Mar, 2011; Schurz et al., 2014; Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009), there has been relatively little attention devoted to the evaluation and standardization of the behavioral methods used in these studies. We hope that the study presented here will help reverse this trend and ultimately deﬁne transparent criteria for evaluating the quality of the behavioral methods used in neuroimaging studies.  R.P.

All peaks survive a whole-brain search thresholded at a voxel-wise family-wise error rate of .05 and a cluster extent (k) of at least 10 voxels. The regions of interest (ROI) used to constrain the search for single-subject voxels were created by growing spheres (radius = 12 mm) around each peak observed at the group-level and intersecting the resulting spherical volume with the group-level t-statistic map thresholded using a voxel-wise p-value of .001. The single-subject columns display the percentage of subjects (of 21) for whom a cluster of at least 10 voxel extent could be identiﬁed in each ROI after thresholding the single-subject t-statistic image using clusterlevel correction at a family-wise error rate of .05.

The cause of this imprecision is no doubt partially attributable to the ﬁrst problem, in that the different tasks used to investigate ToM activate different regions of the brain (Gobbini et al., 2007; Schurz et al., 2014). Indeed, we found that with both univariate and multivariate measures, the Why/How contrast is remarkably distinct when compared to the Belief/Photo contrast (discussed further below). Of equal importance is our observation that the neuroanatomical correlates of the Why/How contrast are highly reliable, both within and across participants, and in our right-handed participants showed a reliable left-lateralization. Moreover, our data suggests that by using the publicly available Why/ How Localizer, future studies can localize this network in individual participant's in as little as 5 min.  This level of anatomical speciﬁcity is largely lacking from extant neuroimaging work on ToM, which has relied almost exclusively on qualitative reviews or large meta-analyses when deﬁning the boundaries of ToM. To be clear, our aim is not to claim that the network identiﬁed by the Why/How contrast is a precise representation of the ToM Network. On the contrary, we think that a central part of the problem is the generally well-accepted idea that there is a single network in the human brain that supports a monolithic ToM ability. This idea seems to have encouraged a disproportionate focus on what is common across the many faces of ToM, both in how it is operationally deﬁned and in where it shows up in the brain. The present studies demonstrate that, moving forward, increased attention will need to be paid to conceiving ToM not as a single ability, but as collection of abilities that may function differently depending on the person and the context.  Evaluating the new Why/How task: strengths and limitations  We believe the new implementation of the Why/How contrast has several notable strengths that make it a powerful instrument for  probing the neurobiological bases of social cognition. At the same time, we acknowledge its limitations.  The task permits use of complex, naturalistic social stimuli  As in the original implementation of the Why/How contrast, the manipulation is attentional in that the Why and How questions are asked of the same set of photographs. This permits use of complex, naturalistic nonverbal social stimuli while avoiding concerns about the innumerable differences that can emerge across such stimuli, such as differences in low-level visual properties, proportion of particular objects shown, or emotional meaning.  We note two caveats in our deﬁnition of the Why/How contrast as an attentional manipulation. The ﬁrst caveat regards the fact that although the photographs are invariant across the Why and How conditions, the reminder cues brieﬂy presented between each photograph naturally varied as a function of the question being asked. This was seen as a desirable task feature that effectively eliminated any working memory demands caused by having to remember the question for the duration of the block. Given that the reminder cues are presented very brieﬂy (350 ms in the Study 1 version; 300 ms in the Study 3 version), and that the results converge with previous Why/How studies using a pure attentional manipulation, we believe it is highly unlikely that these verbal stimuli provide a sufﬁcient explanation for the effects observed in the new Why/How contrast.  A second caveat regards the possibility that Why versus How questions differentially lead subjects to allocate attention onto, or to ﬁxate, particular features of the nonverbal stimuli. Eyetracking could explore the latter possibility (although it is unlikely to show large differences, given the relatively small visual angle subtended by the stimuli in the ﬁrst place). However, attentional issues are harder to isolate. In fact, we think it likely that differential allocation of attention onto particular features of the stimulus may be part and parcel of the differential demand of answering why versus how questions. Whether attention is  310  R.P. Spunt, R. Adolphs / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 301–311  differentially allocated to features of the images, or to associations we have for those features, surely at some level differential attention will need to come into play. Rather than a confound, we would suggest this could be a fruitful line of research in its own right.  The task constrains response content and measures performance  As described above, the original Why/How Task used open-ended Why and How questions to evoke covert responses to social stimuli. Although this method of responding has the desirable feature of being highly naturalistic, it prevents experimental control of response content and performance measurement. The evaluative response method used in the new Why/How contrast represents a signiﬁcant improvement in that it is designed to evoke well-normed consensus responses, and therefore yields accuracy and response time (RT) measures. In the present study, this allowed us to identify a reliable behavioral difference across Why and How questions on both accuracy and RT outcomes. With such well-characterized behavioral effects, we were able to conclusively demonstrate that performance-related variability does not provide a sufﬁcient explanation for the response in the cortical regions observed in the Why/How contrast (Table S2).  A potential limitation regards the fact that the accuracy of a given response is based solely on the consensus of an independently acquired group of healthy, English-speaking, American citizens. This is particularly true in the case of understanding answers to Why questions, which typically draw heavily on knowledge that is likely to be culturally specific. Given this, we clarify that the validity of the accuracy measurement assumes that the respondent has the cultural knowledge necessary for arriving at the answer that elicited consensus in the reference normative sample. While posing some degree of methodological limitation, this feature also opens the door for exciting variations on the task. For instance, one could compare consensus responses across different cultures. Or one could investigate responses in clinical populations who have atypical inferences, such as people with autism spectrum disorders (work currently ongoing in our laboratory). In all of these cases, one can reference the respondents' answer to the normative response, to a group-speciﬁc response (e.g., obtained from the participants in that study beforehand), and one could even derive individually idiosyncratic responses, allowing investigations of universals, culturally or group-speciﬁc processing, and individual differences.  The task has convergent validity  The new Why/How contrast activates a brain network that is convergent with the network typically observed in the original Why/How studies (Fig. 2B). Although suggestive, this is not conclusive evidence that the two versions are interchangeable manipulations of the same underlying process. Indeed, although the two versions are conceptually similar by design, they have obvious differences, the most notable of which is the method of eliciting responses. Given the substantial improvements offered by the new version, we certainly prefer it moving forward, but also suggest that investigating the nature of possible differences in processing demands evoked by the two versions is a worthwhile line for future research.  fact complementary, providing methods for targeting different uses of ToM, measuring different behavioral outcomes, and modulating different brain networks.  The task is ﬂexible  Although we have made the Study 3 version of the task publicly available as a standardized functional localizer, we believe it is worthwhile to highlight the adaptability of the task for a wide array of distinct research questions. Such questions fall into roughly three categories corresponding to variation in the stimulus being evaluated (e.g., facial expressions vs. hand actions, as in the present version); variation in the question being answered (e.g., questions about belief vs. motive); and variation in the person answering the question (e.g., clinical populations). Given the adaptability of the basic protocol, the existence of a standardized protocol, and a growing body of normative data using variants of the Why/How contrast, this task provides a rich opportunity for cumulative research on the neurobiological bases of a speciﬁc use of ToM.  Conclusion  We believe the Why/How contrast is a method for investigating a natural way in which human beings use their ToM to understand their own and other people's behaviors. It elicits an anatomically circumscribed and highly reproducible response in the healthy human brain. Although this response resembles the putative ToM Network, we intentionally avoid calling it by that name. Moving forward, we encourage the ﬁeld to relax its dependence on this misleading label that implicitly endorses the tentative view that ToM is a single ability implemented in a single brain network. There may well be some validity to this singular view of ToM, but even if so, it seems unreasonable to assume that its neural implementation and behavioral expression would appear the same across the many different tasks and measures used to study it. The Why/How Task is one such measure. We would hope that our study catalyzes similar efforts, not just for evaluating extant methods, but developing and validating new ones. The result will be a description of ToM that is as rich as the role it plays in human sociality.

References  The task has discriminant validity  We found that the Why/How contrast show very little overlap with the Belief/Photo contrast produced by the False-Belief Localizer, and that even within an objectively-deﬁned meta-analytic mask of the putative ToM Network, the two contrasts show no evidence of a correlation in their spatially distributed activity patterns. In parallel, response accuracy was not correlated across the two tasks. As such, the Why/How contrast demonstrably taps into a process, or set of processes, that are part of our broad set of abilities to think about the internal states of other people, but that are largely separate from those speciﬁcally isolated by the Belief/Photo contrast. Importantly, this does not demonstrate that the Why/How contrast is an alternative or improvement upon the Belief/Photo contrast.

The present study aims to further understanding of working memory in normal aging using a large cohort of healthy elderly in order to examine three separate phases of information processing in relation to changes in task load activation.  Using covariance analysis, increasing and decreasing neural activation was observed on fMRI in response to a delayed item recognition task in 337 cognitively healthy elderly persons as part of the CRESCENDO (Cognitive REServe and Clinical ENDOphenotypes) study.  During three phases of the task (stimulation, retention, probe), increased activation was observed with increasing task load in bilateral regions of the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobule, cingulate gyrus, insula and in deep gray matter nuclei, suggesting an involvement of central executive and salience networks. Decreased activation associated with increasing task load was observed during the stimulation phase, in bilateral temporal cortex, parietal lobule, cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex. This spatial distribution of decreased activation is suggestive of the default mode network.  These ﬁndings support the hypothesis of an increased activation in salience and central executive net works and a decreased activation in default mode network concomitant to increasing task load.

The working memory model comprises a ‘‘central executive” responsible for information ﬁltering and integration, and two sub-systems manipulating and temporarily maintaining verbal and visual information (the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad), and has been  212  C. Charroud et al. / Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 125 (2015) 211–223  validated by many decades of empirical clinical observation. It has become one of the principal targets for studies of both normal age-related cognitive changes and neuropathologies such as dementia and depression.  respectively  (Smith,  areas  left-hemisphere  Early animal research on the neuronal and neurotransmitter bases of working memory located it principally in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Fuster, 1973). Subsequent PET and fMRI studies in humans have conﬁrmed the central role of the PFC but have further indicated activation throughout the cortex, notably in parietal areas, with spatial and verbal stimuli recruiting principally right and Jonides, Marshuetz, & Koeppe, 1998). Moreover, it has recently been suggested that the PFC may be the principal area associated with information management, with more posterior areas, including the parietal cortex, possibly having a prominent role in information maintenance. This hypothesis has been based on ﬁndings that both areas showing increased interactivity during working memory tasks (Curtis & D’Esposito, 2003; Nee et al., 2013; Rottschy, Caspers, & Roski, 2013). Recent research aimed at differentiating the brain regions involved in working memory have principally used delayed recognition tasks such as Delayed Item Recognition (DIR) (Coltheart, 2006). These tasks enable the differentiation of the three phases of working memory: target/stimulation, delay/ retention and probe/response covering (i) information recording, allowing rapid conversion of visual (or auditory) space into phonological code, and initialization of the phonological loop whether the memorandum allow a verbalization, (ii) the consolidation of articulatory rehearsal, in order to reiterate the phonological loop and actively maintain the memory trace, (iii) retrieval of stored information and its use in decision-making processes.  Functional MRI studies of DIR tasks (Manoach, Greve, Lindgren, & Dale, 2003; Marvel & Desmond, 2010; Nystrom et al., 2000) have reported speciﬁc activation of several brain regions for each of the three phases of working memory functioning: parietal lobules, ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, deep gray matter nuclei, cingulate gyrus, temporal lateral cortex and occipital cortex during the stimulation and retention phase and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula and deep gray matter nuclei during the probe phase. (Cairo, Liddle, Woodward, & Ngan, 2004; Chen & Desmond, 2005). While previous research has principally focused on differentiating activation associated with speciﬁc working memory phases, more recent work has begun to explore the consequences on neural activity of increasing DIR task difﬁculty. To date, two studies (Ansado et al., 2013; Zarahn et al., 2007) of neural network activation (task load) associated with increased task difﬁculty, comparing older and younger healthy individuals found that older individuals demonstrate increased neural activation with increasing load for the same level of performance compared to younger adults. Two case control studies comparing healthy older and younger adults (Sambataro et al., 2010) and mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease subjects (Rombouts, Barkhof, Goekoop, Stam, & Scheltens, 2005) observed decreased neural activity with increasing DIR task difﬁculty in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, inferior parietal lobules and superior and inferior temporal cortex. These areas are described as part of the default mode network (Greicius & Menon, 2004), a network involved in judgment, retrieval and manipulation of episodic memory and semantic knowledge (Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss, & Menon, 2003), selfreferential processing (Gusnard & Raichle, 2001) and mind wandering (Christoff, Gordon, Smallwood, Smith, & Schooler, 2009). The principal shortcoming of previous studies of working memory in the elderly has been the small number of subjects, and given the heterogeneity of elderly persons in relation to health-related variables, it is not surprising that there has been considerable inconsistency in the ﬁndings.  The aim of the present research is to extend knowledge of the multiple and concomitant cognitive processes involved in the maintenance of normal working memory in healthy elderly persons by studying each phase of information processing in working memory in relation to increasing/decreasing task load activation. The study is carried out in a much larger elderly cohort than has previously been examined, thus reducing bias due to sample selection.  2. Methods  2.1. Cohort  The data were derived from the on-going prospective Montpellier-Three-City study (The 3C Study Group, 2003) in which 2259 volunteers (recruited from the electoral rolls), aged 65 years and older, underwent standardized neurological examinations in a dedicated clinical research facility. The clinical examinations were undertaken at baseline (1999–2001) and 2, 4, 7, 10 and 12 years. At 12-year follow-up, participants who were free of dementia and had a Mini Mental State Examination MMSE (Folstein, Folstein, & McHug, 1975) score over 24 were invited to undergo an MRI and complementary clinical examination as part of the CRESCENDO (Cognitive REServe and Clinical ENDOphenotype) study (n = 380). The clinical examination for CRESCENDO participants was carried out approximately 8 months before the MRI examination. Subjects were only able to participate if able to travel to the clinical center and did not have any contraindication for the MRI examination. The diagnosis of dementia was based on a 3-step procedure. First, trained psychologists administered a battery of neuropsychological tests detailed elsewhere (Akbaraly et al., 2009). Second, all the participants were then examined by a neurologist, Finally, an independent committee of neurologists reviewed all potential prevalent and incident cases of dementia to obtain a consensus diagnosis according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Similar procedures were performed at each phase over the 12-years of follow-up for incident dementia screening. Cases of AD were classiﬁed according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzhei mer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (McKhann et al., 1984) and cases of mixed/vascular dementia according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke – Association Internationale pour la Recherche en l’Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria (Román et al., 1993).  The study was carried out at the neuroradiology department of the Montpellier University Hospital Human Functional Imaging Institute (I2FH), France. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University-Hospital of Bicêtre, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Characteristics of the 380 CRESCENDO participants have been compared to the characteristics of dementia-free participants of the MontpellierThree-City study who underwent the 12-y follow-up examination but who were not included in the CRESCENDO study. Recorded clinical data were: laterality (Edinburgh handedness inventory), Body Mass Index, educational level, current lifestyle, MMSE and cardiovascular disease.  2.2. Delayed item recognition task  Working memory was assessed by a DIR task using letter stimuli (Sternberg, 1966), schematized in Fig. 1 (Zarahn et al., 2007). Each trial of the DIR task consisted of 3 phases: stimulation, retention and probe. The stimulation phase is based on the presentation over 3 s of an array of one, three or six capital letters (the number  C. Charroud et al. / Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 125 (2015) 211–223  213  Fig. 1. Schema of the Delay Item Recognition (DIR) task. Each trial of the DIR task included 3 phases: (1) stimulation phase: presentation over 3 s of one, three or six capital letters, (2) retention phase: presentation over 7 s of a blank screen and (3) probe phase: presentation over 3 s of one lowercase letter where subjects indicate whether or not the letter matched with the study array. An inter-trial interval consisting of the presentation of a blank screen over three seconds marked the beginning of each trial. Subjects underwent 3 runs each containing 30 trials (10 trials for each of the three set sizes: 1, 3 or 6 letters pseudo-randomly sequenced) with ﬁve true negative and ﬁve true positive probes per set.  of letters being the set size) the participants having been instructed to remember these letters. During the retention phase, participants were instructed to focus their gaze on the blank screen during 7 s and hold the stimulus items in mind. In the probe phase, a lowercase letter is shown in the center of the screen for three seconds, participants indicate by pressing a button whether or not the probe matched a letter in the study array (right index ﬁnger button press to indicate ‘yes’, left index ﬁnger button press to indicate ‘no’). An inter-trial interval consisting of the presentation of a blank screen for three seconds marked the beginning of each trial. In addition, 70 blank trials (presentation of a blank screen for 2 s) were pseudo-randomly interspersed between trials in each run to reduce the likelihood of neurophysiological responses predictive of the beginning of trials. As indicated in Fig. 1, participants underwent 3 runs each containing 30 trials (10 trials for each of the three set sizes: 1, 3 or 6 letters pseudo-randomly sequenced via a random-without-replacement scheme.) with ﬁve true negative and ﬁve true positive probes per set size. Participants were instructed to respond as accurately as possible. No feedback about performance accuracy was given during the scanning session.  DIR task performance is analyzed according to 3 phases representing (1) the encoding process during the stimulation phase; (2) maintenance processes during retention and (3) the retrieval process during the probe phase. The number of letters determines the level of stimulus difﬁculty, thus differentiating memory-load level. Before fMRI acquisition, participants were trained on at least 2 DIR runs of 30 trials each (the ﬁrst one of which was administered with feedback) on a computer with the help of a neuropsychologist. Vision correction was performed by an ophthalmologist using nonmagnetic glasses in the range of  5 to +3 with 0.5 diopter steps (MediGlasses, Cambridge Research Systems).  2.3. Magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition  Task stimuli were back-projected onto a screen located at the foot of the MRI bed using an LCD projector. Participants viewed the screen via a mirror located in the head coil. Task responses were made on a NordicNeuroLab system (Bergen, Norway, www.  nordicneurolab.com) and behavioral data were recorded on the task computer. Task onset was electronically synchronized with the MRI acquisition computer with the NordicNeuroLab SyncBox. Task administration and data collection (response time and percentage of correct responses) were controlled using publicly available code (https://github.com/steffejr/InterferenceLetterSternberg) developed using Psychotoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/PsychtoolboxDownload). Following the scanning session, DIR task performance (response time and percentage of correct responses) was recorded for each level of difﬁculty. MatLab software (The Mathworks Inc.; MA, USA, R2012a) was used for visual stimulus presentation and recording responses.  Whole brain functional MR images were acquired using a 3Tesla magnet (Skyra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel receive-only head coil. Three hundred sixteen volumes of BOLD Gradient Echo-echo planar images (GE-EPI) were obtained during the functional MRI Sternberg Task with the following imaging parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 20 ms, 39 axial slices, slice thickness 3 mm, slices order: interleaved, in plane resolution 2.39  2.39 mm2, no interslice gap, interleaved, ﬂip angle 90°. The slices covered the whole brain extending from vertex to the upper parts of the cerebellum. For all participants, high-resolution anatomical images were acquired using a 3D magnetizationprepared, rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1690 ms; TE = 2.54 ms; TI = 922 ms; Flip angle 9°, aligned with the corpus callosum; voxel size: 1  1  1 mm; with 176 slices. Magnitude and phase images of the magnetic ﬁeld were acquired with a gradient echo-echo planar (GE-EPI) sequence (TR = 436 ms, TE1 = 4.92 ms, TE2 = 7.38 ms, voxels size: 2.56  2.56  3 mm, ﬂip angle 60°).  2.4. fMRI data pre-processing  Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK, http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac. uk/spm/software/spm8/) (Ashburner, 2012) was used as implemented in MatLab (The Mathworks Inc.; MA, USA, R2012a) for image preprocessing and statistical analyses.  214  C. Charroud et al. / Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 125 (2015) 211–223  It included corrections of magnetic ﬁeld distortion, scan acquisition time difference and head motion. Co-registration to the individual anatomical image was then performed. The anatomical images were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid using a uniﬁed segmentation algorithm as implemented in the ‘‘New segment” function of SPM8. A customized template was created based on the gray matter segmentations using a Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) (Ashburner, 2007). Using this procedure, the anatomical images of each subject were normalized with the created template, and then a mean image of all normalized 3DT1 was performed. Hence functional images were spatially normalized to the 3DT1 mean image and spatially smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁlter with a full width at half maximum of 8 mm to accommodate inter-individual anatomical variability.  2.5. fMRI statistical analyses  2.5.1. Time-series modeling  The GE-EPI time-series were modeled in a ﬁrst level general linear model (Friston et al., 1994) with regressors representing the expected BOLD fMRI response (implicitly, relative to the blank intervals) to the stimulation, retention and probe phases of the task, separately for each block and set size (1, 3 and 6) (Fig. 1). Trials on which there was either an incorrect or no motor response from the participant during the probe phase were modeled separately and not included in the second level analysis. Realignment parameters have been added in the regression models to remove speciﬁc activation due to head movement (translations ‘‘right”, ‘‘forward”, ‘‘up” and rotations ‘‘pitch”, ‘‘roll”, ‘‘yaw”) and a 128 s high-pass ﬁlter was used to remove non-physiological slow signal shifts. Three rectangular functions of duration were used to model neural response: one in the stimulation phase (3000 ms), one in the retention phase (7000 ms) and another in the probe phase (3000 ms). Contrasts were estimated for each load level and phase of the task, using a ﬁrst level general linear model approach. These parametric maps serve as the dependent variables for the subsequent second level covariance analysis (Habeck et al., 2005).  2.5.2. Covariance analyses  Ordinal Trend Canonical Variates Analysis (OrtCVA) was performed for the entire cohort to identify a unique pattern of signal covariance, with expression varying with load (i.e. gradual difﬁculty of the task). This approach is similar to other regional covariance analysis techniques (i.e. Partial Least Squares). It identiﬁes a group-level covariance pattern of task-related brain regions having monotonic increasing (or decreasing) levels of brain activation with increasing task load. This method has been described elsewhere (Habeck et al., 2003, 2005).  A single covariance pattern represents one preferred direction in the vector space determined by the value of activation in each voxel of the image. Neural responses according to increase in difﬁculty for each subject can thus be represented as moving along this preferred direction with individual differences appearing as a change in the degree of this displacement. Displacement therefore indicates the degree of change in response to increase in difﬁculty. The aim is then to identify a pattern of covariance including the similarities between three difﬁculty levels for which the degree of expression may vary. Consequently, this approach does not focus on a particular region or on the activation of one condition of interest, but on changes in regional activation induced by increasing difﬁculty for each subject.  The ﬁrst step consists of a principal components analysis to identify the preferred directions of information; each component corresponding to a direction. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used to select the most relevant components and indicate  privileged directions of interest in the vector space. This criterion, based on the best bias-variance trade-off, can estimate the quality of each model relative to each of the other models (Burnham & Anderson, 2004) thus aiming to reduce the number of components and describe the data with the lowest possible number of components. The preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value. Finally, the covariance model corresponds to the linear combination of the selected principal components. The coefﬁcients of this linear combination are obtained by multiple linear regression with the coefﬁcients representing the best linear mean trend across the three levels of difﬁculty.  The objective of the OrtCVA method is to obtain one wholebrain mapping (at voxel level) whose activations increase and/or decrease with increasing difﬁculty of the task. The different weights of each voxel are assigned by the obtained linear model. A bootstrap estimation procedure is performed to assess this weight in each voxel of the entire group. A map of the group representing this weight is thus obtained and converted into a z score. For instance, if the weight of the voxel is denoted w and its standard deviation is s, the result is: z = w/s. By thresholding the map by a z-score (e.g. |z| = 2.33), the activation will be obtained with a speciﬁc one-tailed probability (e.g., p < 0.01) according to the assumptions of a standard-normal distribution. Thus, the absolute value of weight determines the slope of change. For example, a region whose weight is twice as large as another region indicates that the slope of the activation in this region is twice as high as another region. Positive voxel weights indicate an increased activation with increasing task load while negative voxel weights indicate a decreased activation with increasing task load. The end result of this analysis is a single group level covariance pattern of brain activity demonstrating monotonic changes with increasing task load for each phase of the DIR task. A threshold of |z| = 2.33 for each phase, corresponding to p < 0.01, is applied (Habeck et al., 2005; Moeller & Habeck, 2006).  The property of a monotonic increase/decrease of brain activity with increasing within-subject load is called an ‘‘ordinal trend” and quantiﬁed by repeated-measures F-statistics. It is represented by a p-value generated by a random permutation test. The goal of this test is to sample data at least 1000 times with a random subject/condition using the same set of principal components calculated in the ﬁrst estimation of the model. It provides an additional validation criterion to ensure that the observed covariance model corresponds to activation changes with increasing task load. This test can thus improve the sensitivity of the OrtCVA method without lowering its speciﬁcity.  Data quality control may also be carried out by reporting the number of subjects (number of exceptions) that do not follow the linear trend. When the number of exceptions is high, the linear trend is assumed to not be respected. In addition, the signiﬁcance of the obtained linear model is estimated by a permutation test whose result is a p-value. The aim of this permutation test is to switch subjects (1000 times) to assess the number of exceptions to the obtained linear model for each iteration. If the number of exceptions is lower than that the number of exceptions obtained in the ﬁrst model calculated, the signiﬁcance increases. Thus, the model will be considered signiﬁcant if p < 0.05. Finally, participants that deviate from a monotonic trend are detected and the analysis is not carried out if (1) this occurred for more than 30% of the entire group, (2) the random permutation test generated a p-level higher than 0.05.  In contrast, the analogous general linear model analysis (using SPM) involves voxel-wise analysis of hemodynamic response between task load. This approach is performed using orthogonal contrast for the linear trend which did not focus on the activation changes across load levels. The information relating to the variability of increasing task load between subjects is not taken into  C. Charroud et al. / Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 125 (2015) 211–223  215  account. The OrtCVA method is thus a more stringent validation method than the general linear model in determining pattern variation according to load (D’Esposito, Deouell, & Gazzaley, 2003; Zarahn, Rakitin, Abela, Flynn, & Stern, 2006). However, using the OrtCVA method, comparisons between phases and correlations with a parameter (age, performance. . .) cannot be investigated on brain activation with increasing task load (Moeller & Habeck, 2006).  2.5.3. Statistical analyses of behavioral measures  Kruskall–Wallis non parametric tests were used to compare mean response time and accuracy between each level of task difﬁculty. Signiﬁcance was set at 5%, and statistical analyses were carried out with the R software version 3.0.2. All p values reported were not corrected for multiple testing.  3. Results  3.1. Participant characteristics  Of the 380 CRESCENDO participants, 337 subjects have been included in the present analysis (35 participants did not complete the DIR task and 8 were removed due to head movements during acquisition). Characteristics of the participants are detailed in Table 1.  As expected, an increase in response time and a decrease in percentage of accurate responses were observed with increasing difﬁculty of the DIR task. Mean (SD) for response time was: m = 1.04 (0.23) s for letter 1, m = 1.26 (0.24) s for letters 3 and m = 1.50 (0.29) s for letters 6 (p < 0.0001, two-tailed Kruskal–Wallis test).

Laterality was assessed by the Edinburgh handedness inventory questionnaire. Education level was classiﬁed as low (5 years of schooling or less), medium low (6–9 years), medium high (10– 12 years), and high (more than 12 years). Cognitive deﬁcit was assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination (cut-off for possible dementia < 24). Delayed item recognition task performances (response time and accuracy) are reported in each level of stimulus difﬁculty determined by the number of letters (Letter 1, Letter 3 and Letter 6). Abbreviations: BMI, Body Mass Index; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MMSE, Mini Mental State Examination.  Percentage of accuracy responses were: m = 0.97 (0.05) for letter 1, m = 0.96 (0.07) for letters 3 and m = 0.86 (0.11) for letters 6 (p < 0.0001, two-tailed Kruskal–Wallis test).  3.2. Covariance analyses  OrtCVA analyses identiﬁed covarying increasing and decreasing activation associated with increasing DIR task difﬁculty for the three task phases. Examining individual covariance patterns, the majority of participants were observed to show montonic change in expression with increasing task load as assessed by the permutation tests (98% in the stimulation phase, 88% in the retention phase, 70% in the probe phase).  3.2.1. Increased activation associated with increasing task load  Changes in neural activation, increasing simultaneously with increasing task difﬁculty, presumably reﬂect more effort on the part of subjects to encode, maintain and retrieve information in memory. Across the three phases of the DIR task, brain regions with covarying increased activation are detailed in Fig. 2 and Table 2. During the stimulation phase, we observed bilateral increased activation in the cerebellum (declive and vermis), precentral gyrus and bilateral deep gray matter nuclei (lentiform nucleus and thalamus). During the retention phase, we also observed bilateral increased activation in the cerebellum (culmen, declive, vermis), lateral temporal cortex (left middle and superior gyrus) and bilateral deep gray matter nuclei (caudate nucleus). During the probe phase, we found bilateral increased activation in the fusiform gyrus and bilateral deep gray matter nuclei (lentiform nucleus and thalamus).  Furthermore, some activated regions were similarly observed during the three phases of the DIR task in bilateral frontal lobes (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomesial prefrontal cortex), in bilateral parietal lobes (inferior and superior lobule), bilateral cingulate gyrus and bilateral insula.  3.2.2. Decreased activation associated with increasing task load  Covarying decreasing neural activation in response to increasing task difﬁculty, possibly indicating networks that have to be inhibited to maintain an accurate response, was observed over the three phases of the DIR task. Brain regions showing decreased activation associated with increasing task load are given in Fig. 3 and Table 3. During the stimulation phase, bilateral decreased activation was observed in occipital lobes (fusiform gyrus), parietal lobes (superior and inferior lobules), frontal lobes (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus), lateral temporal cortex (middle and superior temporal gyrus), cingulate gyrus and insula. During the retention phase we observed decreased activation in the occipital lobes (bilateral lingual gyrus, bilateral cuneus, left fusiform, bilateral middle occipital gyrus and left inferior occipital gyrus), limbic system (bilateral amygdala, bilateral cingulate gyrus and left parahippocampal gyrus), bilateral middle temporal gyrus, bilateral superior parietal lobule and left medial frontal gyrus and in areas of deep gray matter nuclei (bilateral putamen and bilateral thalamus). During the probe phase we found decreased activation in the left medial frontal gyrus, bilateral lingual gyrus, bilateral superior and middle temporal gyrus, bilateral cingulate gyrus and bilateral insula.  4.

Regions with increased activation being statistically signiﬁcant (Z score P 2.33) are displayed on transverse slices (MNI space, MRIcroGL software, ch256 template) for (a) stimulation phase (b) retention phase and (c) probe phase of the DIR task. The label number is reported for each slice. The color bar indicates the Z score of activation. (a) During the stimulation phase, regions are activated bilaterally, in the cerebellum, frontal lobe (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomesial prefrontal cortex), parietal lobe (inferior and superior parietal lobules), lateral temporal cortex, insula, cingulate gyrus and in the deep gray matter nuclei (lentiform nucleus and thalamus). (b) During the retention phase, activation involves the same bilateral regions apart from lateral temporal cortex. (c) During the probe phase, activation is mainly seen bilaterally in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, in the superior parietal lobules, in the insula, in the cingulate gyrus and in the deep gray matter nuclei (lentiform nucleus and thalamus).

We found a covarying network of brain regions displayed increased expression associated with increasing task load regardless of the task phase: the bilateral dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobule, bilateral cingulate gyrus and bilateral insula. These ﬁndings conﬁrm previous observations in younger persons, that mobilization of the working memory system involves predominantly, but not exclusively, PFC areas, with concomitant decreased expression in posterior regions. We found decreased activation to be associated with increasing task difﬁculty predominantly the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobules, and cingulate gyrus for the stimulation phase. The spatial distribution of this network suggests similarities with the default mode network during the stimulation phase. Patterns of activation in the PFC were not strongly left-hemisphere dominant although a verbal stimulus was used, probably because short termmaintenance has not been conﬁned to the rehearsal mechanisms of the articulatory loop.  Previous studies using this task have been based on very small numbers (N < 40) and have principally focused on younger subjects (ie < 30 year-old) (Cairo et al., 2004; Chang, Crottaz-Herbette, & Menon, 2007; Chen & Desmond, 2005; Desmond, Gabrieli, Wagner, Ginier, & Glover, 1997; Habeck et al., 2003, 2005; Holtzer et al., 2009; Marvel & Desmond, 2010) or young vs healthy elderly subjects (Ansado, Oury, Nourane, Faure, & Joanette, 2012; Zarahn et al., 2007), and used differing numbers of items (1–8 items) and types of encoding stimuli; letters (Ansado et al., 2013; Bunge, Ochsner, Desmond, Glover, & Gabrieli, 2001; Habeck et al., 2005; Zarahn et al., 2006, 2007), shapes (Holtzer et al., 2009) or numbers (Adler et al., 2001; Portas et al., 1998) thus limiting comparisons between studies. Moreover, these studies have focused either on speciﬁc DIR task phases (Habeck et al., 2005;  Zarahn et al., 2006, 2007) or all phases together (Ansado et al., 2013; Bunge et al., 2001). It is thus not surprising that previous observations have been inconsistent.  In studies using tasks other than the DIR task, few have provided information focused on decreased networks, in either young subjects (Greicius & Menon, 2004), comparing young vs healthy elderly subjects (Sambataro et al., 2010) or comparing healthy elderly subjects to subjects with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease (Rombouts et al., 2005); no studies have to date speciﬁcally focused on elderly subjects. By assessing concomitantly increasing and decreasing activation as a function of increased load, and by exploring each phase of a DIR task in order to examine separately the different cognitive processes of working memory in a large and homogeneous sample of healthy elderly participants, this study has signiﬁcantly reﬁned and expanded knowledge of working memory-related networks in an age cohort particularly vulnerable to working memory changes.  Although the most fMRI studies examine right-handed subjects only, our sample was composed of right (91.7), left (3.6%) and mixed (4.7%) handed subjects. Studies have shown that the spatial distribution of neural networks is mainly symmetrical between left and right-handed subjects (Li et al., 2014; Pool, Eickhoff, Fink, & Grefkes, 2014; Pujol, Deus, Losilla, & Capdevila, 1999; Saenger & Barrios, 2012). Consequently, in our study, we have included all participants regardless of handedness to ensure that our sample may be more exhaustive and representative of the general population of healthy elderly subjects.  4.1.

We found increased activation simultaneously with the gradual increasing difﬁculty of the task in bilateral cerebellum, bilateral cingulate gyrus, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left superior parietal lobule during the stimulation phase; bilateral cerebellum, right cingulate gyrus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobule and left middle temporal gyrus during retention; and bilateral regions of ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula and left thalamus during the probe phase. These ﬁndings are in accordance with those reported by only two studies (Habeck et al., 2003; Zarahn et al., 2007) assessing task load neural networks activation associated with DIR task of increasing difﬁculty. Furthermore, we observed activation in bilateral cerebellum during stimulation and retention phases, as previously reported by Chen and Marvel (Chen et al., 2013; Marvel & Desmond, 2010) suggesting that regions are involved in rapid articulatory mechanism. The cerebellum may  the cerebellar  contribute to articulatory preparation and phonological storage processes during the stimulation phase and to refreshment of the phonological store during retention phase.  During memory tasks, previous studies have identiﬁed the involvement of both salience and central executive networks (Bressler & Menon, 2010; Fecteau, Bell, & Munoz, 2004; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Sridharan, Levitin, & Menon, 2008). These networks have been observed previously using resting-state fMRI (Bressler & Menon, 2010; Chen et al., 2013; Damoiseaux et al., 2006; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Seeley et al., 2007; Sridharan et al., 2008). Several studies (Bressler & Menon, 2010; Bunge et al., 2001; Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000; Chen et al., 2013; Koechlin & Summerﬁeld, 2007; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Müller & Knight, 2006) have suggested that the central executive network is involved in high-level cognitive control and attentional processes by showing that the central executive network is activated during maintenance of information in working memory and during decision-making processes. The DIR task, combining working memory and decision-making processes, may thus be assumed to recruit the central executive network. The spatial distribution of the central executive network has been well described in the literature and appears to implicate bilateral dorsolateral and dorsomesial prefrontal cortex and bilateral lateral pari Table 3 Decreased activation associated with increasing task load.

In our study, we have identiﬁed these regions in each phase of the task, with increasing activation simultaneously with the gradual increasing task difﬁculty (see Table 4).  In addition to the central executive network, the salience network has also been hypothesized to be involved in working memory, especially in cognitive processes involving monitoring,  decision-making, and cognitive control (Bunge et al., 2001; Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000; Chen et al., 2013; Crottaz-Herbette & Menon, 2006; Johnston, Levin, Koval, & Everling, 2007; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Seeley et al., 2007). The spatial distribution of this network in younger persons has been observed to comprise bilateral regions of the insula and cingulate gyrus (Crottaz-Herbette & Menon, 2006; Johnston et al., 2007; Uddin, 2015). These regions were observed in this elderly cohort to be implicated in each  220  C.

However, we identiﬁed some differences between our results and previous studies (Habeck et al., 2003; Zarahn et al., 2007). Concerning additional activation not described previously, we observed, during the stimulation phase, additional activation in bilateral insula, bilateral precentral gyrus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral cuneus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, right superior parietal lobule, left postcentral gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, bilateral superior temporal gyrus and bilateral lentiform nucleus. During the retention phase, we observed supplementary activation in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral insula, left cingulate gyrus, bilateral superior parietal lobule, bilateral caudate and left superior temporal gyrus. Finally, during the probe phase we observed additional activation in bilateral cingulate gyrus, bilateral fusiform gyrus, right lentiform nucleus, bilateral dorsomesial prefrontal cortex and bilateral superior parietal lobule. An explanation could stem from differences in age and performance of the groups included in previous studies. With regard to age, studies by Habeck et al. (2003) and Zarahn et al. (2007) included subjects who were younger than those in the present study. In both these studies subjects not surprisingly performed better (response time shortened by 100–400 ms).The present study has been sufﬁciently powered to take into account age and performance effects.  We may thus hypothesize, that previously observed differences in observed activation may be largely attributable to betweenstudy heterogeneity in age and performance. The DIR task being effortless for younger persons, they may be expected to succeed and increase activation with increased difﬁculty more than older  persons. This difference in activation could be related to the concept of neural efﬁciency in both groups.  On the other hand, previous studies (Habeck et al., 2003; Zarahn et al., 2007) identiﬁed regions that we were not able to reproduce. During the stimulation phase, previous work has identiﬁed activation in the right parahippocampus; during the retention phase, activation in the bilateral precentral gyrus; during the probe phase, bilaterally in the cerebellum. This could indicate a ceiling effect for increased neural activity in relation to increasing demands of the task. That is, irrespective of difﬁculty level, older individuals may reach a maximum neural activation level, which cannot then be further increased in response to task difﬁculty.  4.2. Decreased task load effect  Previous studies assumed that, increased activation in some brain regions occurs simultaneously with attenuation of activation in other regions, in order to perform the DIR task (Griebe et al., 2014; Mayberg et al., 1999; Simpson, Drevets, Snyder, Gusnard, & Raichle, 2001a; Simpson, Drevets, Snyder, Gusnard, & Raichle, 2001b). The attenuated networks have been implicated in memory processes or interfering thoughts such as conscious awareness. Consistent with the second objective of the present study, we have identiﬁed networks with decreased activation associated with the increasing difﬁculty of the DIR task, depending on the phase of the task.  During the stimulation phase, we observed bilateral decreased activation in the middle and superior temporal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, parietal lobes, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Previous studies (Amft, Bzdok, & Laird, 2014; Bastin et al., 2012; Bluhm et al., 2011; Broyd et al., 2009; Buckner, AndrewsHanna, & Schacter, 2008; Greicius & Menon, 2004; Li, Mai, & Liu, 2014; Sambataro et al., 2010) suggested that these regions are functionally connected in the Default Mode Network (DMN).  In the present study, the spatial distribution of regions with decreased activation suggests implication of the DMN. This ﬁnding is consistent with studies in which DMN has been shown to decrease during cognitive tasks, especially during passive sensory tasks (Greicius & Menon, 2004), verbal ﬂuency tasks (Dong et al., 2012), verb generation task (Persson, Lustig, Nelson, & ReuterLorenz, 2007) or visual encoding and non-spatial working memory tasks (Rombouts et al., 2005). DMN has never been reported in a DIR task and this is the ﬁrst study to highlight DMN decreased activation simultaneously with the gradual increasing difﬁculty of a DIR task during the stimulation phase.  4.3. Relationship between increased and decreased task load effect  In brief, when the difﬁculty of the DIR task increases, we observed simultaneously increased activation in salience and central executive networks and decreased activation in DMN (Fig. 4 and Table 4). Previous studies have suggested that the salience network serves to initiate dynamic switching between the central executive network and DMN (Bressler & Menon, 2010; Habeck et al., 2005; Menon & Uddin, 2010; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2012; Pochon et al., 2002).  4.4. Limitations of the present study  A limitation of the present study was our inability to explore the involvement of the cerebellum due to a limited acquisition ﬁeld. Furthermore, we analyzed increased and decreased activation associated with increasing task load on the basis of a linear model, in accordance with previous studies. However, some authors  C.

Task load related networks of the delay item recognition task. We suggest that neural networks implicated in working memory functioning in an elderly cohort are distributed in 3 distinct networks: salience and central executive networks which increased activation is associated with increasing difﬁculty of the DIR task and the default mode network which is related to task load decreased activation. Regions have been identiﬁed using Ordinal Trend Canonical Variates Analysis (OrtCVA) method and have been schematized on transverse slices (MNI space, MRIcroGL software, ch256 template). The central executive network (orange) is composed of (a) dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, (b) left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, (c) right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, (d) left parietal lobule and (e) right parietal lobule. The salience network (yellow) is composed of (f) left cingulate gyrus, (g) right cingulate gyrus, (h) left insula, (i) right insula. The default mode network (blue) is composed of (j) dorsomesial prefrontal cortex, (k) superior parietal lobule – precuneus, (l) left temporal lateral cortex, (m) right temporal lateral cortex, (n) left inferior parietal lobule and (o) right inferior parietal lobule.

Conclusion  Our results suggest that neural networks implicated in working memory functioning in an elderly cohort implicate two distinct networks: salience and central executive. Our results suggest an increased activation in salience and central executive networks and a decreased activation in DMN. Further research is required to determine whether disease-related modiﬁcations in these networks and their relation to cognitive reserve may explain the clinical differences observed between individuals.
