Fifteen healthy female volunteers were tested during a placebo and tryptophan depletion session in an event-related fMRI design. ATD improved performance during Stroop interference. Two effects of ATD on the BOLD response were found. Firstly, ATD increased the BOLD response in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (BA 32) when incongruent color words were compared with congruent color words in the first Stroop block the participants performed. Secondly, ATD increased the BOLD response in the left precuneus (BA 31) and cuneus (BA 18) during congruent color words. ATD did not affect the BOLD response accompanying emotional stimuli. However, we showed that ATD increased the interference of negative words on color naming. This finding was explained in terms of an emotional processing bias in favor of negative words, which leads to stronger interference of these words. In line with previous studies, the present study showed that a temporary reduction of 5-HT improved Stroop performance and changed the underlying brain activation pattern in healthy female participants. Moreover, we replicated our previous finding that ATD modulated the BOLD response in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during tasks that require cognitive control. D 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In a previous study, our group showed that ATD increased the response in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) to negative feedback preceding a switch in response strategy (Evers et al., 2005). Activation in the dmPFC associated with negative feedback has been related to performance monitoring and cognitive control (see Ridderinkhof et al., 2004 for a review). According to one theory (Holroyd and Coles, 2002), the dmPFC response to negative feedback is linked to phasic changes in the midbrain dopamine system related to outcomes that are worse than expected. According to a second theory, dmPFC activation is related to conflict monitoring which becomes necessary when two competing response tendencies become active at the same time (Botvinick et al., 2004). In our previous study (Evers et al., 2005), it was unclear whether the dmPFC response to negative feedback was associated with an outcome that was worse than expected or conflict monitoring. Therefore, the present study examined brain responses to conflict in the absence of negative outcome. This was done in a combined cognitive and emotional Stroop task.  The studies examining the effects of ATD on performance in a Stroop task have been inconclusive thus far. Some studies reported improved performance (Coull et al., 1995; Rosse et al., 1992; Rowley et al., 1997; Schmitt et al., 2000), whereas other studies did not show an effect of ATD on Stroop performance (Gallagher et al., 2003; Horacek et al., 2005; Sobczak et al., 2002). Horacek et al. (2005) showed that ATD increased the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left bilateral mediofrontal, anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during Stroop performance in healthy volunteers. A problem with this study is that performance was measured outside the MRI scanner. It is therefore not possible to judge whether the participants carried out the task correctly during scanning. The current study used an event-related design to study the effect of ATD on the BOLD response during Stroop interference. Performance and the BOLD signal were recorded simultaneously.  5-HT has also been related to emotional processing. Previous studies revealed that ATD impaired the processing of positive  E.A.T.

(2005) showed no effect of ATD on reaction times (RTs) and interference scores during an emotional Stroop task in currently depressed patients. In general, participants experience more interference from negative than from positive or neutral words (e.g. McKenna and Sharma, 1995) which can be explained by the higher threat caused by negative events in daily live (Mandler, 1975; Oatley and Johnson-Laird, 1987). Compton et al. (2003) showed that ignoring negative versus neutral words activated the bilateral occipito-temporal cortex and decreased the activation in the amygdala. Whalen et al. (1998) reported greater activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for negative versus neutral words. However, Compton et al. (2003) did not find brain activation differences between positive and neutral words. To our knowledge, the present study is the first study examining the effect of ATD on the BOLD response during an emotional Stroop task. To study the effect of ATD on cognitive Stroop interference and interference by emotional words, we designed a combined Stroop task in which congruent color (CC), incongruent color (IC), neutral (e.g. house, bean, coin), positive (e.g. proud, friend, smart) and negative (e.g. murder, bitch, death) words were presented in a semi-randomized order. Based on the studies discussed above, we hypothesized that (i) IC words cause more interference than CC words, (ii) IC words are associated with an increased BOLD response in the ACC, inferior frontal junction and middle frontal cortex (Laird et al., 2005) and (iii) ATD does not change or decreases Stroop interference and modulates the related BOLD response. With regard to the emotional Stroop part, we hypothesized that (i) RTs are higher for negative than for positive or neutral words because of the higher threat caused by negative events, (ii) the medial PFC, ACC and insula are activated during emotional words (for a review, see Phan et al., 2002) and (iii) ATD impairs performance on emotional words and affects the related brain activation.  inferior parietal cortex,  Materials and methods  Participants  Nineteen healthy female volunteers (aged between 19 and 33; mean age 22.3; SE of mean 0.7), mostly pregraduate students, were included in this study, which was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University Hospital. Participants were recruited by local advertisements. The health status of the participants was checked by a medical questionnaire, which was evaluated by a medical doctor. The participants received no medication at the moment of inclusion, had never used antidepressants or ecstasy, did not have a family history of affective disorder and were screened for MRI contra-indications. All participants gave written informed consent and were paid 75 euros.  Experimental design  amino acid (AA) mixture followed by a 4.5 h break. During this break, only low protein food and protein and caffeine-free drinks were consumed. After the break (between 2 and 8.30 p.m.), the participants were scanned while performing two blocks of an emotional Stroop task, each lasting about 9 min. Halfway through the scanning session, a structural scan was made, which lasted for about 10 min. Before the first test session, participants were trained in a dummy scanner.  Stroop task  The participants were instructed to report the color of the ink in which the presented words were printed by pressing one of four response buttons. Two fiber-optic response devices with two buttons were used. On the first response box, the left middle finger was used for blue, the left index finger for red. On the second response box, the right index finger was used for green, and the right middle finger for yellow. This color-response correspondence was written in small white letters on the bottom of the screen, along with each presented word. The participants were instructed to learn this correspondence by heart and to look at the bottom of the screen only if their memory failed. The task was programmed in E-Prime V1.0 (Psychology Software Tools, 2002). A word was presented every 2 s against a black background and stayed on the screen until a response was given. A black screen was shown between the response and the next stimulus. No feedback was given.  Participants completed two blocks of the modified Stroop task in each test session. Each block contained 40 CC, 40 IC, 24 positive, 24 negative and 24 neutral words, which were presented in a semi-randomized order (never the same color three times in a row). Each word type was presented equally often in each of the four colors. A test block started with 10 neutral words that were not included in the analysis. During the training session, the participants performed two Stroop blocks each containing 40 CC, 40 IC and 72 neutral words.  The following performance measures were used: mean RT and the number of errors for IC, CC, neutral, positive and negative words and interference scores. Interference scores for the cognitive Stroop express the extra time needed for IC compared with CC words ((RT for IC words   RT for CC words) / RT for CC words) as a percentage. As regards the emotional Stroop, interference scores were calculated for positive compared with neutral words and for negative compared with neutral words (Booij et al., 2005).  Acute tryptophan depletion  The present study used ATD to temporary lower 5-HT in the human brain (Young et al., 1985). The TRP  mixture (75 g) contained 4.1 g l-alanine, 2.4 g l-glycine, 2.4 g l-histidine, 6.0 g l-isoleucine, 10.1 g l-leucine, 6.7 g l-lysine, 4.3 g l-phenylalanine, 9.2 g l-proline, 5.2 g l-serine, 4.9 g l-threonine, 5.2 g ltyrosine, 6.7 g l-valine, 3.7 g l-arginine, 2.0 g l-cysteine and 2.3 g l-methionine. In the BAL mixture, 3.0 g TRP was added. The mixtures were prepared with 200 ml tap water.  Participants were scanned at the Maastricht University Hospital radiology department on two separate test days in an experimental and a placebo test session, counterbalanced according to a doubleblind crossover design. Participants arrived in the morning, after they had fasted overnight and eaten a low protein breakfast, and were given a tryptophan-depleted (TRP ) or a balanced (BAL)  Biochemical measures  Blood samples (10 ml) were taken before ingestion of the AA mixture and about 15 min before the start of the scanning session to determine the plasma TRP level and the TRP/~LNAA ratio ([TRP] / [tyrosine + leucine + phenylalanine + isoleucine +  250  E.A.T. Evers et al. / NeuroImage 32 (2006) 248 – 255  C (10 valine]). Blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 4 min, 4500 rpm). One hundred microliters aliquot of plasma was mixed with 8 mg sulfasalicyl acid and frozen at  80 C until determination of the AAs by high-performance liquid chromatography (Van Eijk et al., 1993).   Questionnaires  Mood  A short visual analogue version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) was used to assess mood (McNair et al., 1988). This questionnaire consists of 32 bipolar sets of adjectives, which measure five mood dimensions: anger, depression, fatigue, tension and vigor. The items were scored on a 10-point scale.  Adverse effects  Adverse effects, 31 items, were registered and scored on a 4point scale from (4). A total score was calculated by adding the scores on the individual items.  F no complaint at all  (0) to  _  F severe complaint  _  Statistical analysis  The effect of ATD on the RTs and the number of errors were analyzed (SPSS version 11.5 for Windows) using GLM repeated measurements with Trial Type (IC and CC, or neutral, positive and negative words) and Treatment (BAL or TRP ) as within subject factors and Order (TRP  or BAL mixture first) as between-subject factor. The effect of ATD on interference scores was analyzed using GLM repeated measures with Treat as within subject variable and Order as between subject variable. Plasma TRP level and the TRP/~LNAA ratio were analyzed using GLM repeated measurements with Time (t0 and t5) and Treatment as within subject variables and Order as between subject variable (Greenhouse – Geisser correction). Paired-sample t tests were used to compare baseline measurements. The effect of ATD on mood and adverse effects was analyzed using GLM repeated measurements with Time and Treatment as within subject variables and Order as between subject variable (Greenhouse – Geisser correction).  Image acquisition  Participants were scanned in a 1.5 T Philips scanner at  the Maastricht University Hospital. T2*-weighted gradient echo planer images (EPI) (TE = 27 ms) were acquired with BOLD contrasts. A whole brain acquisition consisted of 24 slices (slice thickness 5 mm; TR = 1.75 s; voxel size before normalization was 3.5  3.5  5 mm and after normalization 2  2  2 mm; no slice gap; matrix size 64  64  24; oblique transversal orientation; flip angle 90 ), and 220 volumes were acquired for each Stroop block. The stimulus presentation and the scanning were synchronized at the beginning of each run. High-resolution T1-weighted images for anatomical localization were made of each participant (voxel size 1  1  1 mm).  Image analysis  SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) was used for data processing. Preprocessing procedures included slice acquisition time correction (slice 12 as reference slice; TA = 1.68) and within subject realignment (Realign and Unwrap) using the first slice as a reference. Images from session 2 were then coregistered to the mean image from session 1 and thereafter spatially normalized to the standard Montreal Neurolog ical Institute (MNI) structural template (average of 152 T1 brains). Finally, the images were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian (8 mm full-width at half maximum) kernel and high pass filtered (128 s). A simple hemodynamic response was used as a covariate in a general linear model, and a parametric estimate was generated for each voxel for each trial type (correct and incorrect). Individual contrast images were taken to a second level analysis, in which t values were calculated for each voxel treating inter-subject variability as a random effect. The hemodynamic response function was modeled to the onset of the response.  The following contrasts were calculated to assess task effects (BAL data only): 1) IC words versus all other trial types, 2) CC words versus all other trial types, 3) IC minus CC words, 4) neutral words versus all other trial types, 5) positive words versus all other trial types, 6) negative words versus all other trial types, 7) positive minus neutral words, 8) negative minus neutral words. These contrasts were analyzed using whole brain analysis ( P-corrected cluster < 0.05). The following contrasts were calculated to assess the effect of ATD: 9) IC words in the TRP  compared with IC words the BAL condition (IC words  ATD), 10) CC words  ATD, 11) [IC minus CC words]  ATD, 12) neutral words  ATD, 13) positive words  ATD, 14) negative words  ATD, 15) [positive minus neutral words]  ATD, 16) [negative minus neutral words]  ATD, 17) all events (IC, CC, neutral, positive and negative words)  ATD.  The effect of ATD was analyzed using whole brain analysis ( Pcorrected cluster < 0.05). ROI analyses were executed for the IC words (contrasts 9 and 11) using the following ROIs: brain areas that showed increased activation after ATD during a Stroop task as revealed by Horacek et al. (2005): the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47; TAL: x =  24, y = 12, z =  16) and the right medial frontal gyrus (BA 10; TAL: x = 6, y = 52, z = 0). We use WFUPickAtlas tool (Maldjian et al., 2003) for ROI analysis. Tenmillimeter spheres were built around the center coordinates. The Talaraich Daemon was used to label the coordinates of the anatomical regions (http://ric.uthscsa.edu/TDapplet/).  Results  Fifteen volunteers were successfully tested. Of the original 19 included volunteers, two dropped out after the first session because of nausea and vomiting, one volunteer panicked in the scanner, and imaging data for one participant were lost due to technical problems. Nine participants started in the BAL condition and six started in the TRP  condition.  Biochemical results  Blood samples were not complete for five participants due to technical problems. Data are presented for ten participants. ATD lowered ( F(1,8) = 24.8; P = 0.001) the TRP plasma level by 80%. Mean TRP level on the BAL condition was 43.7 AM (SE = 1.8) at t0 and 132.0 AM (SE = 13.2) at t5. Mean TRP levels in the TRP  condition were 46.0 AM (SE = 3.1) at t0 and 9.2 AM (SE = 0.7) at t5. No significant difference in plasma TRP (T =  1.1; P = 0.3) was present at baseline (t0) between the BAL and the TRP  condition. ATD lowered ( F(1,8) = 13.6; P < 0.01) the TRP/ ~LNAA ratio by 91%. The mean ratio in the BAL condition was 0.12 (SE = 0.01) at t0 and 0.14 (SE = 0.01) at t5. The mean ratio in the TRP  condition was 0.12 (SE = 0.01) at t0 and 0.01 (SE =  E.A.T.

GLM analysis showed a main effect of Emotion on RT ( F(1,13) = 3.9; P < 0.05).

RTs for positive and neutral words did not differ. No effect of ATD on RTs was found.

GLM analysis showed a main effect of Trial Type for RT ( F(1,13) = 61.2; P < 0.001): participants responded slower on IC than on CC words. No main effect of ATD was found on RTs ( F(1,13) = 1.2; P = 0.30). Statistical analysis did not show an effect of ATD on the number of error on IC and CC words. GLM analyses revealed an effect of ATD on the interference score for IC words ( F(1,13) = 4.5; P = 0.057). Because of our a priori hypothesis that ATD does not change or decrease Stroop interference, it is allowed to test this hypothesis one-sided. We therefore concluded that ATD significantly de Cognitive Stroop  Task-related BOLD responses during the BAL condition are presented in Table 2. IC words (contrast 1) were associated with an increased BOLD response in the left inferior parietal cortex (BA 40), left middle frontal cortex (BA 46) and right superior temporal cortex (BA 22). CC words (contrast 2) increased the BOLD response in the left inferior parietal (BA 40) and the right inferior frontal cortex (BA 45). IC minus CC words (contrast 3) was associated with an increased BOLD response in a left inferior frontal cluster (BA 44/45).  Since previous research (Compton et al., 2003; Bush et al., 1998) suggested that ACC activation is especially prone to the effects of practice, we conducted a post hoc analysis and investigated the BOLD response associated with IC minus CC words in the ACC (TD label bilateral anterior cingulate as ROI) in  Table 2 Brain areas activated during the different words types in the BAL condition revealed by whole brain analysis  Hemisphere  MNI coordinates  T value  P-corrected cluster  Number of voxels  BA  IC words Inferior parietal cortex Middle frontal cortex Superior temporal cortex  CC words Inferior parietal cortex Inferior frontal cortex  IC minus CC words Inferior frontal cortex  Left Left Right  Left Right  Left Left  IC minus CC words first Stroop block ROI analysis Anterior cingulate cortex  Bilateral  Positive words Inferior temporal cortex  Negative words Postcentral cortex  Left  Left  ( 50,  34, 48) ( 34, 32, 34) (52, 14,  4)  ( 52,  34, 48) (58, 20, 2)  ( 40, 24, 26) ( 38, 10, 22)  6.23 5.80 4.97  6.44 5.14  6.89 5.62  0.021 0.001 0.027  0.012 0.046  0.002  (0, 36, 22)  4.83  0.044  ( 46,  26,  22)  5.72  0.012  ( 44,  32, 46)  5.56  0.015  CC = congruent color words, IC = incongruent color words, BA = Brodmann area.  190 324 179  212 152  279  27  203  223  40 9 22  40 45  45 44  32  20  2  252  E.A.T.

The analysis showed an increased BOLD response in the ACC (BA 32) associated with Stroop interference.  The effects of ATD on the BOLD response during the cognitive part of the Stroop task are presented in Table 3. No effect of ATD was found during IC words (contrast 9). ATD increased the BOLD response in the left precuneus (BA 31) and cuneus (BA 18) during CC words (contrast 10) (see Fig. 1). Whole brain analysis did not reveal ATD effects for contrast 11. To calculate the effect of ATD on IC minus CC words in the first Stroop block the participants performed, we first used a whole brain two samples (BAL or TRP ) t test in which the TRP  Stroop blocks performed first were compared with BAL Stroop blocks firstly performed. Whole brain analysis did not reveal significant effects of ATD. Secondly, an ROI analysis was conducted: a 10-mm sphere was build around MNI x = 0, y = 36, z = 22, which is the center coordinate of the task-related BOLD response in the first Stroop block. This analysis showed that ATD increased the BOLD response in the ACC (BA 32) in the first Stroop block the participants performed (see Fig. 2).  Emotional Stroop  Positive words (contrast 5) were associated with an increased BOLD response in the left inferior temporal cortex (BA 20) and negative words (contrast 6) with an increased BOLD response in the left postcentral cortex (BA 2) (see Table 1).

No effect of ATD was found on the BOLD response during emotional words (contrast 12 until 16) and overall activation (contrast 17).  Subjective measures  On the POMS questionnaire, no effect of ATD was found on the subscales for depression ( F(1,13) = 0.6; P = 0.5), anger ( F(1,13) = 1.3; P = 0.3), fatigue ( F(1,13) = 4.0; P = 0.1) and tension ( F(1,13) = 1.0; P = 0.3). A significant main effect of Time ( F(1,13) = 6.4; P < 0.05) and a significant interaction effects of Time * Group ( F(1,13) = 6.4; P < 0.05) and Treat * Time ( F(1,13) = 5.6; P < 0.05) were found for vigor: participants whose second session was the TRP  session felt less vigorous after ATD. No effect of ATD on physical complaints was found ( F(1,13) = 0.1; P = 0.7).  Discussion  The present study investigated the effect of ATD on performance and the BOLD response during a combined cognitive and emotional Stroop task. In the cognitive part of the Stroop task, we showed first that ATD increased the BOLD signal in the ACC when IC words were compared with CC words in the first block of the Stroop task. Secondly, ATD increased the BOLD response in the left precuneus (BA 31) and cuneus (BA 18) during CC words. At the behavioral level, ATD decreased the interference score for IC words. In the emotional part of the Stroop task, we showed that ATD increased the number of errors on negative words but did not change the BOLD response.  Cognitive Stroop  Largely in accordance with the results of a meta-analysis by Laird et al. (2005), we found an increased BOLD response in the left inferior parietal, middle frontal and the right superior temporal cortex related to IC words in the BAL condition. Interestingly, the current study did not find an increased BOLD response in the ACC during Stroop interference. A study carried out by Compton et al. (2003) also failed to find increased ACC activation during IC words. They suggested that this might be explained by practice effects and mention a study in their laboratory that showed increased ACC activation in the first, no ACC activation in the second and decreased ACC activation in the last third of a Stroop interference condition. Furthermore, Bush et al. (1998) showed that the relative difference in the ACC activity between the interference and the neutral conditions decreased as subjects learned the task. In the present study, the participants performed two blocks of the Stroop task during the practice session (80 IC  E.A.T. Evers et al. / NeuroImage 32 (2006) 248 – 255  253  Talbot and Cooper (in press) showed that ATD reduced the activation in the dorsal ACC (BA 32; MNI: x =  6, y = 38, z = 24) in healthy participants at rest. The present data confirm the suggestion of these authors that the dmPFC might be related to the effect of ATD on cognition in healthy participants. Obviously, more research is needed to examine the seemingly complex association between reduced 5-HT, the dmPFC and cognition.  ATD increased the BOLD response in the left precuneus (BA 31) and cuneus (BA 18) during CC trials. Previous ATD studies (Booij et al., 2005; Gallagher et al., 2003; Horacek et al., 2005; Schmitt et al., 2000; Sobczak et al., 2002) did not examine CC words since these studies used the three-card version of the Stroop task. The present study used a modified Stroop task designed for event-related fMRI in which both IC and CC words were presented. We were therefore able to study the interference (slowing) and the facilitation (speeding) effect of the color name. ATD increased the BOLD response in the cuneus (BA 18; part of area V2) and the precuneus (BA 31; part of area V4) during CC words. These areas are part of the parvocellular path, which is important in color perception (for a review, see Gegenfurtner and Kiper, 2003). The present study suggests that ATD increases the BOLD response in brain areas related to color perception during the reading of CC words. It is noteworthy that ATD did not affect the performance on CC words.  Emotional Stroop  In accordance with our hypothesis, we showed that participants reacted slower to negative than to neutral or positive words. Despite these differences in RTs, we did not find differences in BOLD response between these emotionally salient words. Compton et al. (2003) reported that multiple pilot studies in their laboratory indicated that emotion-related brain activation only showed in a blocked design. It is likely that the presentation of the emotional words in the present study was too short to change the emotional state of the participants. Participants might have been distracted by these words, as shown in the RT data, without showing brain activity related to this emotional state.  Booij et al. (2005) showed that ATD increased interference levels for positive words on an emotional Stroop task. This increase was found in the high-dose ATD condition (100 g), but not in the low-dose ATD condition (50 g). The present study used a 75-g AA mixture, which can be seen as a medium dose. This might explain why the increase in interference levels for positive words was present in our study but did not reach significance ( F(1,13) = 2.1; P = 0.17). Instead, the present study showed that ATD increased the number of errors on negative words. Unfortunately, Booij et al. (2005) did not report the number and kind of errors made during the emotional Stroop task. Studies that investigated the processing of emotional words in depressed patients (e.g. Lim and Kim, 2005; Rinck and Becker, 2005) are in line with our results. These patients often have an emotional processing bias in favor of negative words that are related to their relevant concerns (e.g. Nunn et al., 1997).  A limitation of the present study is that we used female volunteers only. Since previous studies showed that ATD affects females and males differently (Booij et al., 2002; Harmer et al., 2003), the results of the present study are representative for a female population only.  To conclude, the present study confirms the suggested role for 5-HT in response conflict. It showed that ATD improved Stroop  Fig. 2.

A post hoc analysis revealed that the ACC was activated when IC words were compared with CC words in the first Stroop block the participants performed. This result confirms the hypothesis that practice decreased the BOLD response in the ACC.  Post hoc ROI analysis revealed that ATD increased the BOLD response in the ACC (BA 32) when IC words were compared with CC words in the first Stroop block the participants performed. Since the ACC has been related to conflict monitoring and signaling the need for more cognitive control (Botvinick et al., 1999, 2004; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004; Kerns et al., 2004; Matsumoto and Tanaka, 2004), we hypothesize that the increased ACC activation triggered more cognitive control and thereby improved performance during Stroop interference. This hypothesis needs to be tested by future research. In line with these findings, Horacek et al. (2005) reported an increased BOLD response in the ACC (BA 23) after ATD during the interference condition of a Stroop task.  The finding of an increased response in the dmPFC is in line with a previous study (Evers et al., 2005) in which we showed that ATD increased the BOLD response in the dmPFC to negative feedback preceding a switch in response strategy. It should be noted, however, that the center of the area with increased activation was located more ventrally in the present study ([MNI: x = 0, y = 36, z = 22] vs. [MNI: x = 9, y = 39, z = 48]). Based on a review study by Ridderinkhof et al. (2004), which showed that activation related to conflict is not only found in the ACC (BA 24 and 32) but also more dorsally (BA 6 and 8), we would like to speculate that the increased dmPFC response that was found in both studies possibly reflects the same underlying cognitive process. The response to IC trials as well as the response to negative feedback preceding a switch in response strategy might be related to conflict monitoring. In contrast, our research group found that ATD decreased the response in the dmPFC (BA 8; MNI: x = 0, y = 46, z = 38) after a response error followed by negative feedback in a Go/NoGo task in healthy male volunteers (unpublished data).  254  E.A.T.

However, more research is needed to examine the association between low 5-HT, the dmPFC and cognition.

To better understand this conferred risk, we conducted an exploratory study comparing assaulted and non-assaulted girls' behavioral and brain responses during a trust learning task. Adolescent girls (14 assaulted, 16 nonassaulted) performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging task that manipulated the percentages of which three different faces delivered positive and negative outcomes. Analyses focused on comparing unexpected to expected outcomes. We found that assaulted adolescent girls demonstrated less behavioral slowing in response to unexpected negative social outcomes, or trust violations (i.e., when a presumably trustworthy face delivered a negative outcome), relative to control girls. Trust violations were also associated with less activation in anterior insular and anterior cingulate regions among the assaulted group compared to the control group. Furthermore, we found that the severity of participants' exposure to assaultive events scaled negatively with recruitment of these regions. These preliminary results suggest that assault victims may engage differential learning processes upon unexpected negative social outcomes. These ﬁndings have implications for understanding impaired trust learning and social functioning among assault victims.  & 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.  1.  Introduction  Assaultive violence exposure is a signiﬁcant problem among adolescents due to both its prevalence and its conferred risk for negative outcomes. The National Survey of Adolescents found a national prevalence rate of 47% for exposure to physical assault, sexual assault, or witnessed violence among adolescents aged 12–17 (Kilpatrick et al., 2000, 2003). Exposure to assaultive violence among adolescents is strongly associated with (1) an increased risk for mental health disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance use (Kilpatrick et al., 2000, 2003; Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2008; Danielson et al., 2009; Cisler et al., 2011b, 2011a, 2012) and (2) an increased risk for subsequent exposures to assaultive violence in later adolescence and adulthood (Cougle et al., 2009; Cisler et al., 2011b).  Betrayal trauma events, which are characterized by an assault that violates or betrays an extant interpersonal trust relationship between the perpetrator and victim, seem to pose a particular psychosocial risk. When they occur in childhood and adolescence,  n Corresponding author. Tel.: þ1 501 526 8343. E-mail address: jcisler@uams.edu (J.M.

All rights reserved.  these events are associated with a greater incidence of highbetrayal assaultive events in later life (Gobin and Freyd, 2009), suggesting a pre- or post-morbid deﬁcit in correctly evaluating (i.e., learning) trustworthiness of conspeciﬁcs and social situations and/ or adaptively responding to violations of trust. In support of this, prior studies have found that young adult women with prior exposure to interpersonal violence demonstrated higher thresholds for judging social situations as risky and reported less response effectiveness in risky social situations (Wilson et al., 1999; Gidycz et al., 2006; Yeater et al., 2010, 2011; Yeater and Viken, 2010). It has also been found that adults who retrospectively reported high betrayal trauma demonstrated greater errors in detecting violations to rules involving social exchange and/or safety precaution (DePrince, 2005). Collectively, these behavioral ﬁndings suggest that exposure to interpersonal or assaultive violence is associated with an impairment of cognitive processes that underlie social decisionmaking and that this impairment is a possible cognitive mechanism by which assault victims become predisposed to revictimization. The present study sought to further investigate this association between exposure to interpersonal violence and impaired social decision-making by using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) social contingency “trust” learning paradigm. This novel task manipulated the differential trustworthiness of same-sex  2  J.K. Lenow et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 223 (2014) 1–8  conspeciﬁc faces in order to observe and compare assaulted and non-assaulted girls according to their behavioral and neural responses to violations of social expectations.  Based on existing literature concerning social-cognitive differences among assault victims, we hypothesized that interpersonal assaultive violence exposure among adolescent girls would be associated with diminished behavioral and brain responses to social expectancy violations—that is, when a conspeciﬁc behaves contrary to what prior behavior would predict. Reduced reactivity to unexpected behavior could provide one possible mechanism through which prior assault exposure alters social decisionmaking processes to confer risk for future victimization. For this initial exploratory study, we focused here on adolescent girls, a potentially vulnerable population, given that (1) adolescence marks a time of increased social, cognitive, and neural development (Casey et al., 2005; Guroglu et al., 2009; Blakemore, 2012; Blakemore and Robbins, 2012; Crone and Dahl, 2012), making adolescence a critical time period during which assault exposure could impact these developmental processes, and (2) girls are at greater risk for mental health problems following trauma relative to boys (Danielson et al., 2009). Furthermore, based on an accumulation of cognitive and neurobiological research on reinforcement learning and prediction error processing (Behrens et al., 2007; Rushworth and Behrens, 2008; d'Acremont et al., 2009; Bossaerts, 2010; Harris and Fiske, 2010; Jones et al., 2011), we expected a network of coactivated brain regions including striatal, insular, anterior cingulate, and ventromedial prefrontal cortical regions to be activated for expectancy violations for controls and less active (relative to controls) among the assaulted sample, given our hypothesis of diminished reactivity to social expectancy violations.  2. Methods  2.1. Participant recruitment and assessment  Participants were recruited from the general community and from trauma specialty outpatient clinics. Exclusionary criteria for the study included major medical conditions, psychotic disorders, and internal ferromagnetic objects precluding MR scans. Thirty-six adolescent girls, aged 12–16, consented, fulﬁlled all inclusionary criteria for the study, and completed all study procedures. Six participants, however, were excluded from analyses due to excessive head movement causing intractable residual signal artifact in their functional imaging data. This reduced our effective sample size to 30 adolescent girls. See Table 1 for a complete description of demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample. Direct assaultive violence exposure was assessed via the trauma assessment section of the National Survey of Adolescents (Kilpatrick et al., 2000, 2003; Cisler et al., 2012), designed to assess both the incidence and characteristics of discrete types of physical assault, physical abuse, and sexual abuse. When the presence of a form of assault was afﬁrmed (i.e., an event had occurred meeting the criteria of physical or sexual abuse/assault), a series of more detailed follow-up questions were asked to further characterize the instance(s) of assault (e.g., the frequency, location, and identity of perpetrator). Participants' past and current mental health statuses were assessed using the K-SADS inventory (Kaufman et al., 1997) and their clinical and social functioning was measured through both self-rated and caregiver-rated assessments. Caregivers completed the Child-Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach, 1991), which provided measures of social problems, depression symptoms, and aggressive behavior. Participants completed the UCLA PTSD Index–Adolescent (Steinberg et al., 2004), which provided measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity. All participants' Verbal IQs were assessed via the Receptive One-word Vocabulary Test (Brownell, 2000).  We characterized assault exposure using two methods.  (1) We used a dichotomous assault exposure variable (i.e., assaulted vs. non-assaulted) to assess an effect of assault exposure per se. (2) To test for an effect of assault severity, we used a variable representing the severity of each participant's assault exposure history. While past epidemiological studies have used a scalar assault severity variable consisting of the sum of the different types of assaultive events to which the individual was exposed (Neuner et al., 2004; Kolassa et al., 2010b; Cisler et al., 2011b, 2012), in our sample the distribution of this scalar assault variable was right  Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample according to both dichotomous and ordinal assault categorizations.

To improve the normality of this distribution, we instead calculated an ordinal assault exposure severity variable to test for a linear relationship between assault exposure severity and dependent measures of interest. This variable was deﬁned as 0¼no assault exposures (n¼16), 1¼one or two exposures (n¼6), and 2¼three or more exposures (n¼8).  2.2.  fMRI task  All participants engaged in an identical social learning task in which they were given a hypothetical cache of money (initialized at $50). In each trial, $10 of their money was invested by the computer pseudorandomly to one of three neutral female faces (from the published NimStim facial stimuli set (Tottenham et al., 2009)). The face either kept the money ( $10) or returned twice as much (þ$20)  back to the participant. After each of the 96 trials, participants rated which face was the most trustworthy. Participants were instructed to track which face over the course of the entire experiment was the most trustworthy. Fig. 1 indicates two potential trial sequences. To manipulate the differential trustworthiness of the faces, each of the three faces, for the ﬁrst 48 trials, gave the money back to participants a predetermined percentage of trials, 80, 50, and 20%, respectively (e.g., face 1 gave participants' money back 80% of the time across the ﬁrst 48 trials). After the initial 48 trials, face 1 and face 3's percentages switched such that face 1 henceforth gave back only 20% of the time and face 3 80% of the time, thereby violating previously established behavioral expectancies and creating a high conﬂict epoch. The last 24 trials were excluded from analyses to focus on conﬂict and prediction error processing rather than reversal learning (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for more detailed behavioral analyses and further explanation for excluding of the last epoch). The trials in which face 1 (the overall most trustworthy face) took  Fig. 1. (a) An example trial sequence resulting in a negative outcome in which Face 3 takes the participant’s investment of money.

Lenow et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 223 (2014) 1–8  participants' money were modeled as unexpected negative outcomes, and the trials in which face 3 (the overall least trustworthy face) gave participants money back were modeled as unexpected positive outcomes. Conversely, trials in which face 1 gave participants money were modeled as expected positive outcomes, and trials in which face 3 took participants' money were modeled as expected negative outcomes. However, because the ﬁrst six trials at the beginning of the experiment occurred before expectations could have reasonably been formed and therefore represented a learning acquisition phase rather than an expectation phase, they were excluded from expectation analyses and modeled as a separate regressor. We excluded the ﬁrst six trials (as opposed to the ﬁrst ﬁve or seven, etc.) because they were counterbalanced across faces such that the ﬁrst six trials comprised the ﬁrst two trials of each face—an effort to conserve experimental power without compromising the validity of the experimental manipulations.  a measure of cognitive conﬂict (i.e., greater RT indicates greater conﬂict between prior expectancies and the observed outcome on the current trial).

Image acquisition and preprocessing  Imaging data were acquired using a Philips 3T Achieva X-series MRI system with an eight-channel head coil (Philips Healthcare, USA), with functional images acquired at a ﬁnal resolution of 3  3  3 mm3 with a repetition time of 2000 ms. See Supplementary materials for a detailed description of acquisition parameters and preprocessing steps.  2.4.  fMRI analyses  Explicit deconvolution was conducted to estimate the hemodynamic response function (HRF) for each individual participant at each voxel for each task condition, using regression with 7 cubic splines over the 12-s interval following the onset of each stimulus. The ﬁrst and last time point estimates were constrained to zero in order to ensure neurophysiologically plausible shapes of the HRF. This approach was used to account for the wide range of inter- and intra-individual variability of the HRF. The areas under the curve (AUC) of each individual's estimated HRFs were calculated using a numerical integration function and transformed into percent signal change to compare across voxels, task conditions, and participants (Urry et al., 2006; Greene et al., 2007; Borst et al., 2010).  Contrasts between different conditions were computed to compare relative percent signal change as a function of task manipulation. To test our social expectancy violation hypothesis, the contrasts of interest were those comparing unexpected and expected outcomes. Speciﬁcally, we tested for effects of unexpected relative to expected takes (i.e., trust violations), unexpected relative to expected gives, and unexpected relative to expected outcomes collapsed across both valences. We tested for relationships between assault exposure status and each contrast of interest using a series of whole-brain robust regression analyses (Wager et al., 2005), which provided t-tests of the beta coefﬁcient values for the control group (i.e., the intercept) and for the difference between the control and assaulted groups. Separate regression analyses were conducted for the dichotomous assault exposure variable and the ordinal assault severity variable. Using AFNI software (Cox, 1996), we set a corrected alpha level of po0.05 with clusterthresholding (Forman et al., 1995). In this procedure, we ﬁrst estimated the amount of spatial smoothing (from 3dFWHMx) in the residuals of the data (from 3dREMLﬁt). This estimate is then used in Monte Carlo simulations implemented in 3dClustSim (with 10,000 iterations), which demonstrated that a cluster size of 38 contiguous voxels surviving an uncorrected p-value of 0.005 would yield a corrected po0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Demographic results  There were no differences between assaulted and control groups on dimensions of age, IQ, and ethnicity. The assaulted group demonstrated higher rates of PTSD, alcohol abuse, substance use, and caregiver-rated aggressive, anxious-depressed, and socially problematic behavior (see Table 1).  3.2. Behavioral results  response  trustworthy  Participants'  trial-by-trial  choices (Supplementary Fig. 2) indicate, among assaulted and control subjects, a clear preference toward face 1 in the ﬁrst half of the experiment. In the epoch occurring directly after the reversal, subjects' responses are more volatile—lending support to our categorization of the third epoch as high conﬂict. Response times (RTs) during the response trials were also recorded and used as  3.3.  fMRI contrast results  3.3.1. Testing an effect of trust violations among controls  Given the novelty of the current study's task and the uniqueness of our sample, it is relevant to deﬁne normative brain activity among control adolescent girls during task contrasts in order to facilitate the interpretation of group comparisons. For the trust violation contrast (unexpected takes-expected takes), controls demonstrated activity in bilateral anterior insula (AI), perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and left visual cortex (Supplementary Fig. 2; see Supplementary Table 1 for more detailed descriptions of clusters). To test the effects of trust violations controlling for the effects of expectancy violations per se (i.e., in order to test the speciﬁcity of trust violation effects), we created a negative versus positive expectancy ([unexpected takes–expected takes] [unexpected gives–expected gives]). For this contrast (that is, for trust violations speciﬁcally), controls demonstrated activity in dmPFC (XYZ¼  2, 41, 18, peak t(28)¼3.67, cluster size¼50) (Supplementary Fig. 3).  violation contrast  3.3.2. Testing for between-group differences during trust violations When testing for differences in brain activation as a function of assault exposure per se (i.e., using the dichotomous assault variable to test for between-group differences) during unexpected–expected takes, we found clusters of lesser activity among the assaulted group in the perigenual ACC, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), and bilateral insulae (see Supplementary Table 1 for more detailed descriptions of clusters). We next tested for a linear effect of assault exposure using the ordinal assault variable (coded as 0¼no assaults, 1¼one or two assaults, 2¼greater than two assaults) for the same trust violation contrast. This yielded signiﬁcant clusters in pgACC and mPFC, bilateral AI, and left dorsal striatum that all negatively scaled with assault severity (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 1 for % signal change of clusters, stratiﬁed across ordinal labels, for which there was a signiﬁcant linear relationship). Performing the same analysis with a contrast collapsed across the valence of unexpected outcomes (i. e., unexpected takes combined with unexpected gives), we observed a signiﬁcant cluster in the right hippocampus that scaled negatively with assault exposure severity (XYZ¼23,  20,  13, peak t(28)¼  4.90, cluster size¼55) (Supplementary Fig. 5). Comparing the effects of negative versus positive expectancy violations to test for speciﬁcity of the unexpected outcomes (i.e., (unexpected–expected takes)–(unexpected–expected gives), we found a cluster in the dmPFC (XYZ¼8, 53, 18, peak t(28)¼  4.49, cluster size¼38) severity (Supplementary Fig. 3). We found no signiﬁcant ﬁndings of a priori theoretical interest for the unexpected–expected gives contrast.

This demonstrated a signiﬁcant indirect mediation effect of assault exposure on RT bias through altered left AI activity (indirect effect¼  184.69, 95% CI¼  332.72 to  36.67, Supplementary Fig. 6b).  3.5. Relationship with clinical variables among the assaulted group  Given that the assault group also differed from the control group in clinical symptoms (see Table 1), we conducted a subsequent exploratory analysis to test whether the altered brain responses identiﬁed among the assaulted group during the unexpected versus expected take contrast were related to clinical symptom severity (e.g., substance use, aggressive behavior) within the assault group only. We deﬁned regions of interest (ROIs) in the pgACC, right and left AI, and left IFG from clusters identiﬁed in the whole-brain regression analysis results using the ordinal assault variable. To correct for the number of hypotheses we tested, we used a False Discovery Rate (FDR) control (Genovese et al., 2002). Among the assaulted girls only, assault severity scores (i.e., the total number of assaultive events to which the individual was exposed (Neuner et al., 2004; Kolassa et al., 2010a, 2010b) were found to be negatively related to activity in both left and right AI (t (12)¼  3.38, pFDR-correctedo0.05; t(12)¼  3.38, pFDR-correctedo 0.05, respectively). Additionally, CBCL-rated aggressive behavior was negatively related to activity in the left IFG (t(12)¼  3.915, pFDR-correctedo0.05). Of the 14 assaulted participants, eight had either received psychological/psychiatric treatment in the past or currently; thus, we also used robust regression to examine the effect of treatment history on brain function within these ROIs. There was no difference between groups (treatment history vs. no treatment history) on activation within any of the ROIs (pFDR-corrected40.40).  4. Discussion  To the investigators' knowledge, this is the ﬁrst neuroimaging study of social learning among adolescent victims of assaultive violence. The results of this study demonstrate that (1) assault victims exhibit both reduced behavioral and brain responses to trust violations, (2) the greater the severity of assault exposure, the lesser the magnitude of these brain responses, and (3) this reduced brain activity mediated the reduced behavioral responses among the assaulted group. Additionally, that assaulted adolescent girls' reduced AI activity during trust violations was predictive of greater presence of mental health-related symptoms (e.g., aggressive behavior) suggests the clinical relevance of the current ﬁndings; speciﬁcally, these observations suggest that reduced brain activity during trust violations might be indicative of poorer clinical functioning. Improved mental health outcomes might be potentiated by cognitive behavioral interventions that speciﬁcally target social decision-making by, for instance, incorporating risk assessment and risk reduction techniques into therapies (Danielson et al., 2010, 2012).  In the context of biological psychiatry and clinical neuroimaging research, we believe the current study's ﬁndings emphasize the context dependence of clinically meaningful behavioral and neural differences among people who are at risk for or are diagnosed with psychopathology. For instance, anxiety disorders – and in particular PTSD – have been broadly associated with hyperactivity in cingulate and insular regions (Frewen et al., 2008; Pitman et al., 2012). Indeed, we found that in an overlapping sample as that of the current study assault exposure among adolescent girls was associated with greater activity, during an emotion-processing task, in a frontocingulate ‘salience' network  Fig. 2. Signiﬁcant clusters identiﬁed in whole-brain group-level regression analysis using the ordinal assault severity variable (coded as 0¼no assaults, 1¼one or two assaults, 2¼more than two assaults) during trust violations.

Statistical parametric map is thresholded at 2.75 to correct for multiple comparisons and overlaid onto a high-spatial-resolution anatomic image (i.e., N27 Colin template).  3.3.3. Regression with RT bias scores  RT bias scores (RT on unexpected trials minus RT on expected trials) as a continuous variable was also used as a regressor for the unexpected take versus expected take contrast, and we found a cluster in the left AI (XYZ¼  47, 11, 6, peak t(28)¼3.84, cluster size¼48) that scaled positively with greater RT bias scores (Supplementary Fig. 6a). To determine the voxels that signiﬁcantly scaled with both assault exposure severity and RT bias scores, we performed a conjunction analysis on the two statistical spatial maps revealing a common cluster in the left AI (XYZ¼  47, 17,  4, cluster size¼17).  3.4. Mediation analyses  Given the observations of (1) a relationship between assault severity and RT bias, (2) a relationship between assault severity and activity in the anterior insula, and (3) a scalar relationship between RT bias and activity in left AI during unexpected takes, we performed a mediation analysis for left insular activity using the clusters identiﬁed in the conjunction analysis above. This model tested whether altered recruitment of left AI operated as a mediating mechanism between assault and attenuated RT bias. Following the standard mediation model (Baron and Kenny, 1986), these analyses included paths A (the effect of the independent variable on the mediator), B (the effect of the mediator on the outcome controlling for the independent variable), and C (the effect of the independent variable on the outcome). To quantify these paths, assault exposure severity was regressed onto % signal change AUC estimates of clusters in the AI, and activity of the AI was regressed on RT bias scores after statistically partitioning out the effect of paths A onto paths B. The indirect effect of assault exposure severity on RT bias through left AI was calculated as the sum of the products of the A and B paths. To test the signiﬁcance of the indirect path, we implemented a bootstrapping method with  6  J.K. Lenow et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 223 (2014) 1–8  composed primarily of loadings in the anterior insular cortex and dorsal and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (Cisler et al., 2013). This suggests that the vulnerable population of assaulted adolescents do not demonstrate broad, uniform changes in brain activity but rather exhibit dynamic, context-sensitive or domainspeciﬁc changes. Furthermore, corresponding to the aforementioned differences in hyper- versus hypo-activity, there has been relatively widespread evidence that anxiety disorders, including PTSD (Cisler et al., 2011), are generally associated with greater cognitive conﬂict and emotional reactivity, particularly to negatively valenced events and stimuli (Bar-Haim et al., 2007). The current evidence of reduced conﬂict in response to trust violations among assault victims again demonstrates the importance of context in understanding function within core cognitive and neural mechanisms. Important to appreciate in examining these apparent discrepancies are the perhaps unique characteristics of the sample composition of the current study (as our sample was not strictly clinical but rather an at-risk sample that demonstrated speciﬁc characteristics in terms of age, sex, and trauma type) and experimental paradigm (as our study employed a cognitively complex task, the performance of which requires the coordinated recruitment of various cognitive processes). With these differences in mind, however, it seems the current results advocate for a more nuanced view of the neurobiological and cognitive substrates of assault exposure speciﬁcally and perhaps of psychopathology more generally.  In the reinforcement learning literature, studies have found that the magnitude of value prediction errors (i.e., discrepancies between predicted and observed outcomes) and risk prediction errors (i.e., discrepancies between predicted and observed outcome variance, or risk) predict activity in anterior cingulate regions (Behrens et al., 2007; Rushworth and Behrens, 2008) and the AI (Preuschoff et al., 2008; d’Acremont et al., 2009; Bossaerts, 2010), respectively. During our task, activity in these particular regions was negatively associated with both assault severity and negative RT bias scores and, critically, this relationship was observed during trials in which there would be both high value prediction errors (expectancy violations) and high risk prediction errors (increased outcome variance). Insofar as activation of AI and ACC during trust violation trials would be consistent with prior literature regarding the neural correlates of domain-general as well as domain-speciﬁc social prediction errors (Harris and Fiske, 2010; Jones et al., 2011), the reduced recruitment of these regions among assaulted girls supports the hypothesis that assaulted adolescent girls demonstrate attenuated prediction errors.  Although we cannot claim that the current study’s task, which notably used simulated faces instead of actual conspeciﬁcs, can clearly generalize to the more social cognitively complex concept of trust, we believe that at the very least the task engages similar cognitive processes as would underlie real-world social decisionmaking and therefore could serve as a reasonable proxy or laboratory analogue. Additionally, to the extent we are uncertain whether the task measures social-speciﬁc learning versus domaingeneral learning, we also cannot make ﬁrm inferences regarding whether the observed differences represent altered social-speciﬁc learning mechanisms. Nonetheless, these observed differences among assaulted girls may have clinically meaningful implications regardless of whether they are social-speciﬁc or domain-general. There are several potential explanations for the observed ﬁndings. One explanation is that assaulted girls have a preexisting negative expectancy bias such that they are biased toward expecting negative events and, in the context of the experiment, preemptively expect a negative outcome from the otherwise presumably trustworthy face 1. Accordingly, they would generate no prediction error when face 1 takes their money because this negative outcome was, either implicitly or explicitly, expected.  This expectancy bias could be an adaption of the assaulted girls in response to seemingly unpredictable, severely negative social outcomes (e.g., assaultive events). This general negative expectancy bias would still be compatible with the increased risk for revictimization observed among interpersonal violence victims. For example, it could be the case that chronic general negative evaluations of other conspeciﬁcs leads to difﬁculty in navigating complex social environments, such as discriminating between ‘safe’ and ‘unsafe’ conspeciﬁcs depending on situational contexts or dispositional characteristics. An alternative explanation is that assaulted girls could fail to assign salience, informational value, and/or signiﬁcance to unexpected negative behavior. This desensitization could also function as an adaptation to volatile social (familial, community) environments and a history of interpersonal trust violations (e.g., assaultive events perpetrated by family members and acquaintances, as were the cases for the current study’s entire sample). Future research should seek to more speciﬁcally characterize and localize the cognitive etiologies of these group differences. Despite the etiology, however, these data might provide a potential mechanism explaining the high rates of revictimization among assault victims. That is, the failure to generate a prediction error signal when a presumably trustworthy individual behaves in a socially negative manner (whether due to alterations in forming expectations or in prediction error processing) could potentially explain how a victim may fail to detect and avoid risky social situations. Indeed, past research has found that young adult women with victimization histories have higher thresholds for judging social situations as risky (Gidycz et al., 2006; Yeater et al., 2010; Yeater and Viken, 2010). However, because the current study’s ﬁndings among assaulted girls were demonstrated to be related to assault severity and the more severely assaulted girls by deﬁnition had been revictimized more frequently, it is not possible to infer causality between these two related ﬁndings. That is, the observed differences among assaulted girls could be a neurocognitive consequence of revictimization, a neurocognitive mechanism of revictimization, or a non-causally-related neurocognitive correlate of assault. Any of the three interpretations, however, is clinically relevant and might indicate a need to incorporate procedures to improve judgments of socially risky situations into treatments for trauma-related psychiatric conditions in order to reduce the likelihood of revictimization and improve clinical outcomes (Danielson et al., 2010, 2012).  4.1. Study limitations  While novel and promising in terms of recommending future research among victims of interpersonal violence, the current study is not without limitations. That all of the severely assaulted girls (ordinal label of 2) and none of the mildly to moderately assaulted girls (ordinal label of 1) were exposed to sexually assaultive events introduces an ambiguity as to whether effects observed as a function of assault severity were in part also due to sexual assault exposure. Although this possibility reduces the discriminative validity of the current study’s ﬁndings, it highlights a need to examine both main and interaction effects of different types of assault. Another potential limitation of the current study concerns the psychiatric composition of our sample (i.e., the uneven distribution of psychiatric diagnoses among the sample). What might be a limitation of the study’s internal validity, however, might also be – to the extent the sample represented a real-world population of assaulted adolescents who rarely demonstrate complex assault histories without also demonstrating complex psychological proﬁles including pre-, co-, and postmorbid psychiatric disorders – a strength of the study’s external validity and clinical relevance. Furthermore, the current exploratory study’s sample of assaulted adolescents was relatively small, highlighting the need for replication and extension in future studies.  J.K. Lenow et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 223 (2014) 1–8  7  The cross-sectional design of the study precludes inferences as to whether the observed differences associated with assault were caused by assault exposure or due to pre-existing characteristics among the assaulted group. Regardless of this inability to infer causality, prior research indicates that assaulted adolescents are a signiﬁcantly at-risk sample for mental health disorders (Kilpatrick et al., 2000, 2003; Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2008; Danielson et al., 2009; Cisler et al., 2011a, 2012) and revictimization (Cougle et al., 2009; Cisler et al., 2011b), and while this study cannot determine whether the observed differences were due to assault speciﬁcally, our results do suggest signiﬁcant behavioral and brain differences in this vulnerable population which can potentially help explain the increased risk observed in this population.  Notwithstanding the study’s limitations, the results support the hypothesis of diminished behavioral and brain responding to trust violations among adolescent female victims of assaultive violence.

However, the neuronal basis of psychopathy and its contribution to the prediction of criminal recidivism is still poorly understood. We compared structural imaging data from 40 male high-risk violent oﬀenders and 37 non-delinquent healthy controls via voxel-based morphometry. Psychopathic traits and risk of violence recidivism were correlated with gray matter volume (GMV) of regions of interest previously shown relevant for criminal behavior. Relative to controls, criminals showed less GMV in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and more GMV in cerebellar regions and basal ganglia structures. Within criminals, we found a negative correlation between prefrontal GMV and psychopathy. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between cerebellar GMV and psychopathy as well as risk of recidivism for violence. Moreover, GMVs of the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (SMA) were positively correlated with anti-sociality. GMV of the amygdala was negatively correlated with dynamic risk for violence recidivism. In contrast, GMV of (para)limbic areas (orbitofrontal cortex, insula) was positively correlated with anti-sociality and risk of violence recidivism. The current investigation revealed that in violent oﬀenders deviations in GMV of the PFC as well as areas involved in the motor component of impulse control (cerebellum, basal ganglia, SMA) are diﬀerentially related to psychopathic traits and the risk of violence recidivism. The results might be valuable for improving existing risk assessment tools. Ó 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Empirically developed risk assessment instruments provide a probabilistic estimate of the violence risk of a speciﬁed time period (Swets et al., 2000; Hanson and Howard, 2010). Risk factors that are unchangeable (e.g., school maladjustment, history of alcohol problems, age at index oﬀense) are commonly referred to as ‘static’. In contrast, ‘dynamic’ risk factors (e.g., impulsivity, unstable interpersonal relationships, lack of cooperation) assess the client’s treatment readiness and possibility of change. The Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG) for example is most commonly used by clinicians for assessing the static risk of violent recidivism of violent oﬀenders (Quinsey et al., 1998). In addition, the Violence Risk Scale (VRS) allows a prospective rating of static and dynamic risk of violence recidivism (Wong and Gordon, 2006). A recent meta-analysis found little variation among the mean eﬀect sizes of common actuarial or structured risk instruments (Campbell et al., 2009). Therefore, neuroscientiﬁc methods may have the potential to improve existing tools for prediction of violence recidivism (for a recent review, see Meixner, 2014). However, despite the recent growth of knowledge on structural and functional alterations in the brain of individuals, who commit violent crimes, the contribution to criminal law (e.g., questions of credibility, culpability, or prediction of future recidivism) is still low.  Psychopathy has been reported to be strongly associated with violence and criminal recidivism (Hare, 1991, 2003). It is a personality construct characterized by deﬁcits in interpersonal relations and aﬀective processes (e.g., fearlessness, callousness, failure to form close emotional bonds, dishonesty, deﬁcits in passive avoidance learning, and deﬁcient empathic responses) as well as antisocial and impulsive behavior (Hare and Neumann, 2008). The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) is a valid measure of psychopathy (Hare, 2003) and has been successfully introduced as an instrument for risk assessment (Hare et al., 2000). It comprises two factors reﬂecting emotional and interpersonal detachment (Factor 1) as well as antisocial behavior and parasitic lifestyle (Factor 2). Regarding the two-factor model emotional detachment is the key feature of psychopathy (Hare, 2003). There is an ongoing debate about the question, whether the predictive eﬃcacy of the PCL-R should be attributed more to Factor 1 or to Factor 2. In a recent  V. Leutgeb et al. / Neuroscience 308 (2015) 194–201  195  meta-analytic study (Yang et al., 2010) the authors questioned the predictive quality of Factor 1 for violence in men, as the subscale predicted violence only at chance level. In contrast, Factor 2 showed high predictive quality. A disruption of brain regions underlying moral thinking and feeling might be central for antisocial behavior (for a thorough discussion, see Glenn et al., 2012). In line with this notion, magnetic resonance imaging studies have found signiﬁcantly reduced gray matter volume (GMV) of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in patients with antisocial personality disorder (APD) and/or high levels of psychopathy which has been interpreted to lead to poor behavioral control (Raine et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2005; Mu¨ ller et al., 2008). Gregory et al. (2012) found reduced prefrontal GMV in oﬀenders with APD, who were classiﬁed as psychopaths, relative to oﬀenders with APD ‘alone’, and suggested that psychopathy represents a distinct phenotype. Moreover, psychopathy and persistent violence have also been associated with decreased gray matter in limbic and paralimbic areas such as the amygdala, the insula, the hippocampus, or the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (e.g., Boccardi et al., 2011; ContrerasRodrı´ guez et al., 2014; Yang and Raine, 2009; Ermer et al., 2012; de Oliveira-Souza et al., 2008). Existing results are somehow inconsistent, as Boccardi et al. (2011) reported enlargement of the lateral and central nucleus of the amygdala in oﬀenders relative to controls. Anyway, the notion that psychopathy is associated with fronto-limbic gray matter reductions and dysfunctions concerning moral sensibility and behavior seems to be widely accepted (e.g., de Oliveira-Souza et al., 2008; for a review, see Simpson, 2012). Despite the fact that the majority of studies found reduced structures in antisocial or psychopathic groups, there is evidence that some brain regions, like basal ganglia and cerebellar cortex, may actually be larger (Barkataki et al., 2006; Tiihonen et al., 2008; Glenn et al., 2012). In addition, there are reports of abnormalities in the supplementary motor area (SMA) in criminals with high PCL-R scores (Mu¨ ller et al., 2008). As those brain regions are associated with motor control and higher-order functions of motor cognition, structural deviations in samples aﬄicted with APD might explain  impulsivity and poor behavioral control as well as violence recidivism (Bari and Robbins, 2013; Picazio and Koch, 2015).  The current investigation was designed to compare structural imaging data of high-risk violent oﬀenders with non-delinquent controls. We expected enhanced GMV in criminals relative to controls in basal ganglia and cerebellar regions, as well as reduced GMV in prefrontal structures and (para)limbic areas (e.g., the amygdala). For psychopathic traits and risk of criminal recidivism we hypothesized positive correlations with GMV of basal ganglia and cerebellar regions as well as the SMA, and negative correlations with prefrontal and limbic areas (e.g., amygdala).  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Subjects  We investigated 40 male inmates from a maximumsecurity prison located in Graz (Austria) and 37 male, non-delinquent controls with comparable age (prisoners: M = 38.1 years, SD = 12.0; controls: M = 36.7 years, SD = 9.6; t(75) = 0.5, p = .589). To avoid group diﬀerences in overall intelligence, participants of the two groups were matched according to their educational level (years of education; prisoners: M = 11.4 years, SD = 1.9; controls: M = 11.6 years, SD = 1.4; t(75) =  0,6, p = .520). Moreover, the groups were matched according to their handedness (73 right-handed; four left-handed). All participating prisoners were high-risk violent oﬀenders (with one or more index convictions for violence). Sexual oﬀenders were not included in the sample. All participants were to be released to the term (which meant early community in the near their release/conditional sentence). psychiatric assessment and structured risk assessment was performed by experienced forensic psychologists or psychiatrists and actuarial instruments (see below). Clinically relevant symptoms of depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, as well as organic (e.g., hyper- or hypothyroidism) or  release or comprehensive  A  completion of  clinical  Table 1.

All participants provided written informed consent after receiving a full explanation of the test procedure. The study was in accordance with the Operational Guidelines for Ethics Committees That Review Biomedical Research (WHO, 2000) and had been approved by the ethics committee of the University of Graz.  Clinical assessments  Clinical rating-data and questionnaire scores for prisoners and controls are summarized in Table 1. For both groups, two independent raters ﬁlled out the Hare PCL-R, which is a reliable and valid measure of psychopathic traits in the prison system (Hare, 1991, 2003). The PCL-R consists of 20 items, which have to be rated on a 3-point-scale. It uses a semi-structured interview, case history information, and speciﬁc scoring criteria and consists of two factors (Hare, 2003). Factor 1 is comprised by the following two aspects: interpersonal (glibness/superﬁcial charm, grandiose sense of self-worth, pathological deception, conning/manipulative) and aﬀective (lack of remorse or guilt, shallow aﬀect, callous/lack of empathy, failure to accept responsibility for actions). Factor 2 is comprised by the following two aspects: lifestyle (need for stimulation/proneness to boredom, parasitic lifestyle, lack of realistic long-term goals, irresponsibility) and antisocial (poor behavioral control, early behavioral problems, revocation of conditional release, criminal versatility). Inter-rater reliabilities (Pearson’s correlations) for the sum score and subscales (Factor 1 and 2) of the PCL-R were suﬃciently high and ranged for prisoners from r = .80 to .88, and for controls from .81 to .96.  juvenile delinquency,  impulsivity,  Two scales, focusing on risk of violence recidivism, and thus on oﬀense history, were additionally ﬁlled out for the prisoners by two independent raters, but not for controls: we obtained the VRAG, which was developed to assess risk of violent recidivism (Rossegger et al., 2009). The scale contains 12 items reﬂecting static risk factors (e.g., age at index oﬀense, index victim injury, sex of index victim). VRAG scores allow assignment of an oﬀender to one of nine risk categories, ranging from one (lowest risk) to nine (highest risk). The inter-rater reliability (Pearson’s correlation) for the sum score of the VRAG was r = .99. The second scale was the VRS (Wong and Gordon, 2006). This scale was constructed for purposes of risk assessment and prediction. It integrates violence assessment, prediction, and treatment  and consists of six items forming a Static Factor and 20 items forming a Dynamic Factor. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale. Static variables, such as oﬀense history, remain unchanged regardless of treatment interventions. In contrast, dynamic variables such as interpersonal aggression or emotional control identify treatment targets linked to violence, and assess the client’s treatment readiness and possibility of change. The inter-rater reliabilities (Pearson’s correlations) for the subscales of the VRS were r = .99 for static variables, and r = .98 for dynamic variables.  All participants ﬁlled out  the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI; Schwenkenmezger et al., 1992). The inventory consists of six scales: Trait Anger (frequency of anger experience), Temperament (intense anger in response to mild provocation), Rejection (sensitivity to criticism), Anger-Out (disposition to express anger aggressively), Anger-In (disposition not to act out feelings of anger), Anger-Control (disposition to suppress feelings of anger). For this questionnaire, participants are asked to rate 44 items on 4-point scales that assess both the intensity of their anger at a particular time and the frequency that anger is experienced, expressed, and controlled.  MRI acquisition and VBM analyses  T1-weighted scans were acquired using a 3T Siemens Skyra with a 32-channel head coil (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The scanning parameters were as follows: voxel size: = 0.88  0.88  0.88 mm; 192 transverse slices, TE = 1.89 ms, TR = 1680 ms; TI = 1000 ms, ﬂip-angle = 8o.  thickness:  0.88 mm,  slice  of GMV. Anatomical  Brain imaging data were analyzed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging; http://www.ﬁl. ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/) including the VBM8 toolbox (revision 435; http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm) for voxel-based morphometry in order to gain voxel-wise comparisons scans were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid partitions. An optimized blockwise non-local means de-noising ﬁlter, a Hidden Markov Random Field approach, partial volume estimates, and normalization to MNI space by high-dimensional warping (DARTEL) with a standard template included in the VBM8-toolbox were used for pre-processing (ﬁnal resolution: 1.5 mm  1.5 mm  1.5 mm). A Jacobian modulation for non-linear normalization was applied to correct for diﬀerences in head sizes and to obtain brain volume. Smoothing was executed with a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm. Based on previous VBM studies with criminal, antisocial or psychopathic populations (Raine et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2005; Mu¨ ller et al., 2008; ContrerasRodrı´ guez et al., 2014; Barkataki et al., 2006; Tiihonen et al., 2008; Ermer et al., 2012) the following regions of interest (ROIs) were selected: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), OFC amygdala, insula, caudate nucleus, pallidum, putamen, cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, and SMA. For the present study we used ROIs from the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template. The ROIs were constructed with the WFU PickAtlas (version 2.4; Wake Forest Univer V.

Moreover, investigations showed increases in putamen volume in patients aﬄicted with APD (Barkataki et al., 2006). As they also observed this increase in violent relative to non-violent schizophrenics, the authors hypothesized a general involvement of this structure in violence. This seems plausible, as striatal structures have been found to be involved in impulsivity and poor behavioral control (Garavan, 2002). In line, our regression analysis within criminals revealed a positive relationship between antisocial behavior (Factor 2 of the PCL-R) and GMV of putamen and pallidum.  Another brain region that might have a relevant contribution to psychopathic traits is the cerebellum, due to its involvement in motor control (for a discussion, see Picazio and Koch, 2015). To our knowledge, there is one investigation that found larger GMV of the cerebellum in persistently violent oﬀenders with APD relative to  Fig. 2.

Within the current study, there was a very consistent positive relationship between predictors of violent crimes and cerebellar GMV. This was true for interpersonal and aﬀective problems associated with psychopathy (Factor 1 of the PCL-R), static risk factors and criminal relapse rates. Additionally, measures for temperament and expression of anger correlated positively with cerebellar GMV. Therefore, our data point to an involvement of the cerebellum in psychopathic traits and criminal recidivism. The enhanced cerebellar GMV in criminals relative to controls might be interpreted to explain heightened impulsivity and poor behavioral control. In line, our regression analysis within criminals revealed a positive relationship between antisocial behavior (Factor 2 of the PCL-R) and GMV of the SMA, a brain region that is also known to be involved in motor control and impulsivity (for a recent review, see Bari and Robbins, 2013). In addition, expression of anger was positively correlated with the volume of the SMA.  The cerebellum has also been reported to be critically involved in moral behavior and aggression and possess various anatomical connections, also with the PFC (see Turner et al., 2007; Fumagalli and Priori, 2012; Demirtas-Tatlidede and Schmahmann, 2013). Thus, it seems interesting that in line with several structural studies with anti-social (e.g., Raine et al., 2000; Tiihonen et al., 2008) or psychopathic (e.g., Yang et al., 2005; Mu¨ ller et al., 2008; Contreras-Rodrı´ guez et al., 2014) individuals we found reduced GMV in the PFC in criminals relative to controls. Structural and functional changes of the PFC are the best-replicated abnormalities across a wide range of antisocial groups and have also been  imaging methodologies (Glenn obtained with diﬀerent et al., 2012). The involvement of the PFC in higherorder executive functions can easily explain emotional deﬁcits, poor decision-making, and lack of behavioral control in violent oﬀenders. In line, the regression analysis of our data within criminals revealed a negative correlation between interpersonal and aﬀective problems associated with psychopathic traits (Factor 1 of the PCL-R; e.g., superﬁcial charm, a manipulative nature, and lack of empathy) and GMV of the dorsolateral PFC.  Lastly,  the current  investigation failed to detect reductions in GMV of (para)limbic areas in oﬀenders relative to controls. However, we found a negative relationship between dynamic risk factors for criminal relapse and gray matter of the amygdala. The amygdala is known to be crucial for emotional re-learning and conditioning (LeDoux, 2000). In fact, in an fMRI investigation psychopaths showed deﬁcient fear conditioning and reduced amygdala activation relative to healthy controls (Birbaumer et al., 2005). A deﬁciency to emotionally relate to neutral and biologically signiﬁcant events might be central in psychopathy. Our study suggests that there is an association between reduced amygdala volume and dynamic risk factors for violence. In contrast, we found a positive relationship between antisocial behavior (Factor 2 of the PCL-R) as well as criminal relapse rates and GMV of (para)limbic areas (OFC, insula).  Summing up the correlations between GMV and risk assessment scales, both factors of the PCL-R revealed a relationship to GMV in violent oﬀenders. Factor 2, reﬂecting antisocial behavior and parasitic lifestyle, was positively related to volumes of putamen, pallidum, and  200  V. Leutgeb et al. / Neuroscience 308 (2015) 194–201  the SMA. In contrast, Factor 1, reﬂecting the core features of psychopathy, revealed a positive relationship with the cerebellum and a negative relationship with the dorsolateral PFC. Thus, although the predictive quality of Factor 1 for violence in men has been questioned in previous investigations (Yang et al., 2010), our data provide support for a diﬀerential relationship between the core features of psychopathic personality traits and GMV. Thus, the association between cerebellar volume and Factor 1 of the PCL-R should be further investigated. In addition, risk of violence recidivism (VRAG, VRS) was positively related to cerebellar GMV and negatively related to amygdala volume.  in future investigations,  CONCLUSIONS  for criminality, and moreover,  if  far  still  to imprisonment. Science is  the PFC as well as areas Abnormalities in GMV of involved in the motor component of impulse control (cerebellum, basal ganglia, SMA) seem to be related to psychopathic traits and the risk of criminal recidivism in violent oﬀenders. It remains unclear, if the abnormalities are causal they are reversible. With respect to this and also as a limitation for the interpretation of group diﬀerences it has to be noted, that we did not control for childhood history (e.g., abuse or poverty) or history of alcohol and drug abuse prior from establishing neurobiological criteria as a contribution to ﬁnal decisions in the court (for a discussion, see Witzel, 2012). However, the integration of objective neurobiological criteria, and an understanding of the interaction of biological and psychological factors could provide a higher quality of risk assessment. In addition, understanding neurobiological correlates of mental disorders could be helpful for improving therapeutic interventions. Lastly, a neurobiological evaluation of treatment success in forensic psychiatry would be of great value for the decision if patients should be discharged, or not. Remedial eﬀorts in the treatment of psychopathy might be most eﬀective when implemented prior to the onset of severe antisocial behavior in teenage years (Anderson and Kiehl, 2014). Future studies should therefore focus on changes in regional brain structures associated with therapeutic treatment. Moreover, future investigations should explore the neuronal basis of the relationship between self-report measures of psychopathic traits and criminal behavior.

During anticipation of unpleasant symptoms, high fear participants reported more intense body symptoms and showed potentiation of the startle reﬂex. After this learning session, participants were taken into the fMRI where the same cues either predicted the occurrence of hyperventilation or normoventilation, although the task was never performed in the scanner. During anticipation of hyperventilation all participants showed an increased activation of anterior insula/orbitofrontal cortex and rostral parts of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dACC/dmPFC). Brain activation of high compared to low fear participants differed in two ways. First, high fear participants showed an overall stronger activation of this network during threat and safe conditions indexing stronger anxious apprehension during the entire context. Second, while low fear participants no longer responded with stronger activation to the threat cue after experiencing that the hyperventilation challenge did not follow this cue, high fear participants continued to show stronger activation of the network to this cue. Activation of the rostral dACC/ dmPFC was signiﬁcantly correlated with reported fear of somatic symptoms. These data demonstrate that anticipation of interoceptive threat activates the same network that has been found to be active during anticipation of exteroceptive threat cues. Thus, the current paradigm might provide an innovative method to study anxious apprehension and treatment effects in patients with panic disorder.  © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  reliably elicit a fear  Cues that predict the occurrence of a nociceptive event (e.g., a moderately painful electric shock) response characterized by increased autonomic arousal and defensive response mobilization as indexed by a potentiation of the startle reﬂex (Davis, 2000; Hamm and Vaitl, 1996; see for review Hamm and Weike, 2005). In humans, the pattern of fear responses elicited by such cues is identical irrespective of whether the individual directly learns that the cue is associated with the aversive event in a fear conditioning procedure or whether participants are just instructed that the nociceptive event will be presented during one cue (threat condition) but not during the other (safe condition) (Grillon et al., 1991; see for review Grillon and Baas, 2003). Findings from neuroimaging studies suggest that the neural networks involved in both fear conditioning and instructed  ⁎ Corresponding author. Fax: +49 3834 863790.

A conditioned stimulus that has previously been paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus in a fear conditioning experiment consistently activates a neural network involving the amygdala, the insula, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Büchel et al., 1998; LaBar et al., 1998; for a meta-analysis see Sehlmeyer et al., 2009). Likewise, if participants are instructed that one of two cues might be followed by an electric shock or by aversive pictures, this warning cue also consistently activates the insular cortex and the ACC (e.g., Chua et al., 1999; Kalisch et al., 2006a; Nitschke et al., 2006; Phelps et al., 2001, 2004). While some studies also found increased activation of the amygdala (particularly in the left amygdala) during instructed fear (Nitschke et al., 2009; Phelps et al., 2001) this ﬁnding was not always reported in other studies (Mackiewicz et al., 2006; Nitschke et al., 2006). One reason for these discrepant results might be that amygdala activation is often attenuated during later trials of cued shock anticipation (Phelps et al., 2001).  In a recent meta-analysis of 15 instructed fear studies Mechias et al. (2010) found consistent larger activation to the warning cue in the bilateral anterior insulae but also in a larger cluster including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the rostral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which the authors interpreted as an  858  K. Holtz et al. / NeuroImage 61 (2012) 857–865  index of increased threat appraisal of these warning cues. Interestingly, the same neural network is also activated if phobic student volunteers are instructed that a certain cue predicts the occurrence of the picture of a phobic object (Simmons et al., 2006; Straube et al., 2007). Stronger activation in the insular cortex was also found for patients with generalized social phobia during anticipation of public speaking (see Fredrikson and Furmark, 2003). Nitschke et al. (2009) found increased activation of the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex in patients with generalized anxiety disorder during anticipation of neutral and aversive pictures, suggesting that such anticipation of threat paradigms could be used as powerful tools to study neural networks of anticipatory anxiety in various anxiety disorder patients. While these paradigms using anticipation of exteroceptive threat stimuli (such as moderate pain stimuli or symptom-speciﬁc aversive pictures or situations) might be useful to study patients with phobias or generalized anxiety disorders these external threat conditions are not suitable to study patients with panic disorder. In fact, if patients with panic disorder are instructed that one of two cues will be followed by a moderately aversive nociceptive stimulus panic disorder patients do show increased autonomic arousal and a clear potentiation of the startle reﬂex, but this cued fear response is not larger than the defensive mobilization observed in non-anxious control participants (Grillon et al., 1994, 2008; Melzig et al., 2007). Such ﬁndings may not come as an absolute surprise, because a second key feature of panic disorder—aside from recurrent panic attacks—is anxious apprehension directed at those body symptoms that are associated with panic attacks (see Bouton et al., 2001). Accordingly, Melzig et al. (2011) recently demonstrated that individuals reporting high fear to unexplained somatic sensations (scoring high on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Peterson and Reiss, 1992) showed a signiﬁcant potentiation of the startle response during recovery from a hyperventilation challenge, i.e., a period during which various body symptoms were still perceived after the challenge. Moreover, even anticipation of such hyperventilation task results in an increase of autonomic arousal and a clear potentiation of the startle reﬂex in these panic prone individuals but not in those participants who scored low on this dimension (Melzig et al., 2008) providing a good model to study anticipatory anxiety in panic disorder patients.  The current study follows up on this research investigating the neural networks involved during the anticipation of such interoceptive threat cues. Surprisingly, there are only two previous fMRI studies that assessed neural responses during anticipation and provocation of panicogenic symptoms in healthy volunteers injecting the neuropeptide cholecystokinin in its tetrapeptide form (CCK-4) (Eser et al., 2009; Schunck et al., 2006). Pharmacological provocation of somatic symptoms resulted in a strong increase of reported panic symptoms compared to placebo injection and stronger activation in the ventral ACC, the insula, the cerebellum, and the temporal pole including the amygdala (Eser et al., 2009). No differences in brain activation were found in those volunteers who reported a panic attack during the pharmacological challenge and those who did not. Anticipation of CCK-4 injection resulted in a stronger activation of the dorsal ACC but no differences were found in neural responses between anticipation of CCK-4 and placebo, suggesting that the injection procedure might have been an aversive event irrespective of the pharmacological challenge (Eser et al., 2009). In the study by Schunck et al. (2006) anticipatory anxiety to CCK-4 could not be analyzed due to the limited number of high responders in this study. Thus instead of using a pharmacological challenge, the current study investigated anticipation of a hyperventilation challenge (to induce potentially threatening somatic symptoms) and used normoventilation as a non-aversive control condition. Moreover, we introduced the hyperventilation challenge outside of the scanner. So, the context of the scanner was not associated with the provocation of the panic symptoms, which may have produced aversive context conditioning that might have overridden the anticipation of a safe condition in the previous studies (like injection  of a placebo). Finally, to increase the probability of increased anticipatory anxiety to such interoceptive threat conditions we pre-selected our participants so that half of our sample reported high fear to unexplained somatic sensations as assessed by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; Peterson and Reiss, 1992) and the Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ; Chambless et al., 1984) while the other half of the sample scored low on these dimensions.  Materials and methods  Participants  About 250 students of the University of Greifswald were screened with a German version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; Peterson and Reiss, 1992). Those persons scoring either high or low (at least one standard deviation from the mean [M±SD=20±9]) on the ASI were contacted by telephone and screened for the following criteria: subjects should not be in treatment for psychological disorders and had to be free of any cardiovascular or respiratory diseases and seizure disorders. After this screening procedure 29 subjects agreed to participate in the study. From these individuals 15 participants (9 females) reported high fear of unexplained somatic sensations and 14 participants (10 females) reported low fear of body symptoms. Both groups were comparable with regard to their age M (Range) 23.6 (18–42) vs. 23.9 (19–37), t(27)=0.16, p=.88, and gender distribution, chi2=0.42, p=.52.  Participants completed several questionnaires for a more detailed sample characterization: the trait portion of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, 1983; German version: Laux et al., 1981), the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ; Chambless et al., 1984; German version: Ehlers et al., 1993a), and the Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ; Chambless et al., 1984; German version: Ehlers et al., 1993b). Participants reporting high fear of unexplained somatic sensations in the ASI and BSQ also reported greater trait anxiety and more agoraphobic cognitions (see Table 1), replicating previous ﬁndings (Melzig et al., 2009, 2011) also indicating that this analog sample parallels patients with panic disorder in their pattern of reported concerns (see McNally, 2002).  Stimulus materials  Two different colored slides were projected to a screen (1.50× 1.30 m) in front of the subjects. A red slide indicated a threat condition (a hyperventilation task might follow—interoceptive threat), a green slide indicated safety (no hyperventilation task will follow—safety). In order to maintain the inherent warning signal of red and to facilitate the association between the warning cue and the possible hyperventilation, colors were not randomized across subjects.  Hyperventilation task  The hyperventilation task was introduced as a “fast breathing exercise” that could induce somatic sensations like palpitations, sweating, dizziness, or feeling faint, but that these symptoms would disappear  Table 1 Means and standard errors of self report measures for participants reporting high and low fear of unexplained somatic symptoms.

During the 3 min hyperventilation task, tones of rising and falling pitch were presented via headphones prompting the participants to breathe in with rising and breathe out with falling pitch of the tone (see Melzig et al., 2008, 2011). Participants were thus led to breathe at a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (bpm). During the hyperventilation procedure, the respiratory rate as well as the CO2 of the expired air were monitored continuously by a Nellcor NPB-70 Capnograph (Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Pleasanton, CA) to ensure compliance with the hyperventilation procedure. To ensure that the hyperventilation task was executed properly and hypocapnia was obtained to provoke physical symptoms in all participants, visual feedback (different colored LEDs attached under the screen) was used to instruct the participant to breathe deeper (red LED) until a target petCO2 of 20 mm Hg was reached. Visual feedback (green LED signaled to “breathe more shallow”, no LED signaled to “keep breathing at a constant depth”) was also used to keep the low level of petCO2 during the entire hyperventilation task.  Startle stimulus  A 50 ms burst of white noise (95 dB[A] (rise/fall timeb1 ms) was generated by a Coulbourn S81-02 noise generator (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA) and presented binaurally via AKG K-66 headphones.  Symptom ratings  Participants rated the severity of the 14 panic symptoms, as listed in the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very intense) experienced (a) during the hyperventilation task and (b) during the anticipation period. Intensity of anxiety and tension experienced during hyperventilation and anticipation was also rated on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very intense). Finally, participants rated how unpleasant they felt during the hyperventilation and during viewing of the red and the green anticipation slide again using the same 10-point scale.  Procedure  During the ﬁrst part of the study a learning session was conducted in which participants went through three guided hyperventilation tasks. The learning session started with the presentation of the red warning slide for 3 min followed by the ﬁrst hyperventilation task as described above followed by a 3 min recovery period. After recovery, participants were instructed to rate the intensity of anxiety, tension, unpleasantness, and severity of symptoms during the hyperventilation task. Then, the green slide was presented for 3 min signaling the safe condition followed by a 3 min recovery period. Afterwards, participants rated symptom severity and feeling states during anticipation of threat (red slide) and safety (green slide). Following this learning phase participants were instructed that the colored slides were now presented for a shorter duration and that a hyperventilation task might follow after the red slide (instructed interoceptive threat condition) and that the green slide will deﬁnitely not be followed by a hyperventilation task. The red (R) and green (G) slides were presented for 18 s six times each, alternating with a 15 s presentation of a ﬁxation cross in two different pseudorandomized orders, (order 1: GGRRGRGRRGGR; order 2: RGGRGRGRGGRR), randomly assigned to the subjects and balanced out within and between the groups. Startle probes were presented either at 3, 8, or 11 s after the onset of the red and green slide (overall 12 startle probes were delivered). The 3 min hyperventilation task was introduced after the third and the sixth presentation of the red slide resulting in two additional hyperventilation tasks in this session. Again, each hyperventilation was followed by a 3 min recovery period after which participants rated the severity of the panic symptoms and anxiety intensity experienced during the preceding hyperventilation task. Ratings of symptom severity and anxiety intensity during anticipation of threat and safety were obtained at the end of the entire procedure. The upper panel of Fig. 1  shows the petCO2 levels during the three hyperventilation tasks, demonstrating that all participants included in the analysis were compliant with this procedure (see Fig. 1A) and even slightly improved with the repetition of the task. The lower panel of Fig. 1 depicts the rated intensity of the experienced panic symptoms during the hyperventilation procedure (see Fig. 1B), indicating that participants with high fear of unexplained somatic symptoms reported more severe panic symptoms than low fear participants. These group differences remained stable across all three hyperventilation tasks.  After this procedure subjects participated in the fMRI experiment at the Functional Imaging Unit of the Center for Diagnostic Radiology at the University of Greifswald as soon as the scanner was available (on average within the same month). After receiving a detailed introduction to the method of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), participants were again instructed that, paralleling the previous session outside the scanner, the red slide will signal that the hyperventilation task might follow while the green slide indicated safety (deﬁnitely no hyperventilation task). Participants were provided with the nasal canula that was used to measure expired CO2 in the previous session and were instructed that the rising and falling tone would be presented via loudspeakers to maximize the credibility that the red cue would indeed be followed by the hyperventilation task. In fact, the hyperventilation task was never performed in the scanner.  After these instructions, and signing informed consent, subjects rated their current tension and anxiety prior to the experiment on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no anxiety/tension at all) to 10 (extremely strong anxiety/tension).  Participants were then placed in the fMRI scanner. The experiment started with anatomical scans that took about 6 min. Each section of  Fig. 1. A. PetCO2 during the three hyperventilation tasks.

Holtz et al. / NeuroImage 61 (2012) 857–865  the experiment was introduced via intercom that allowed the experimenter to talk to the participant while he or she was lying in the scanner. The anatomical scans were followed by the experiment starting with the presentation of a ﬁxation cross followed by the red (R) and green (G) slides for 18 s each, alternating with a 15 s presentation of a ﬁxation cross exactly in the same order as during the learning session (except that the hyperventilation task did not follow the third and the last red slide). The slides were presented via a projector onto a screen outside the scanner that was placed about 2 m in front of the participants' eyes. Subjects looked at the screen by help of a mirror system in the scanner. The session ended with recording of 3D anatomical scans that took about 10 min. After leaving the scanner, participants again rated their anxiety and tension during the scanning procedure as well as after the scanning.  Before leaving the laboratory all participants were informed that the study was aimed at investigating whether fear of unexpected somatic sensations would be associated with the activation of speciﬁc neural networks.  Apparatus and data acquisition  To record the eyeblink component of the startle response, two electrolyte ﬁlled Ag/AgCl miniature surface electrodes (Marquette Hellige, Freiburg, Germany; Sensormedics, Yorba Linda, CA) measured the electromyographic activity (EMG) over the orbicularis oculi muscle beneath the left eye. The raw EMG signal was ampliﬁed by a Coulbourn S75-01 ampliﬁer using a 30 Hz high-pass ﬁlter and a Kemo KEM-VBF8-03 400 Hz low-pass ﬁlter (Kemo Limited, Beckenham, UK) and further digitized at 1000 Hz using a 12-bit A/D converter. Digital sampling lasted from 100 ms before until 400 ms after the onset of the acoustic startle stimulus. Before the scoring procedure started, a digital 60 Hz high-pass ﬁlter was applied to the raw EMG data off-line to remove eye movement artifacts.  MRI data were acquired using a 1.5 Tesla Magnetom Symphony system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) that was additionally equipped with an 8-channel headcoil. Prior to each session, ﬁeld homogeneity was optimized by using a shimming sequence. After aligning the images in a transversal direction parallel to the AC–PC line on the basis of a localizer scan a T1-weighted anatomical volume (TE 4.88 ms, ﬂip angle 40°, FoV 192 mm, matrix 256×256, voxel size 1×1×1 mm) was recorded. Then, the stimulus presentation was started, during which 137 volumes with 33 slices each (3 mm thick, 0.75 mm gap) were acquired using echo-planar images (EPIs; TR 3000 ms, TE 50 ms, ﬂip angle 90°, FoV 192 mm, matrix 64×64, voxel size 3×3×3 mm).  Data processing and analysis  The raw orbicularis oculi EMG was integrated off-line with a time constant of 10 ms and reﬂex eyeblinks were then scored using a computer program (Globisch et al., 1993) that identiﬁed the latency of blink onset in ms and peak amplitude in µV. All blinks occurring between 20 and 100 ms after startle probe onset and reaching their peak amplitude within 150 ms were scored as valid startle response trials. Trials showing clear movement artifacts or excessive baseline activity were rejected and deﬁned as missing trials. If no response could be detected in the deﬁned time window, the trial was scored as zero magnitude. Digital values were converted into μV. Baseline group comparisons of overall reactivity were conducted using the raw startle magnitudes. Blink magnitudes were standardized to correct for interindividual variability that was unrelated to the experimental conditions before statistical analyses of the effects of interoceptive threat were performed (as suggested by the guidelines for human startle eyeblink electromyographic studies, Blumenthal et al., 2005). This transformation could ensure an equal contribution of each participant to the analysis of the experimental conditions. Responses of each participant were transformed to z-scores (raw scores  for each participant were subtracted from that person's mean score divided by that person's standard deviation) and then converted into t-scores, i.e. 50+[z× 10].  For the statistical analyses, a mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for verbal report and startle eyeblink measures. For all analyses, Condition (anticipation of threat vs. safety) was entered as a within-subjects factor and Group (low vs. high fear participants) as a between-subjects factor. For the analysis of startle eyeblink, Block (ﬁrst vs. second half of the session) was entered as an additional within-subjects factor. Post-hoc t-tests were applied whenever a significant main effect was present. All statistical tests used a signiﬁcance level of p b.05 and were accomplished using SPSS 19.0.  The fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using the statistical parametric mapping software (SPM5, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK). The preprocessing included spatial realignment, co-registration, normalization into the MNI space, and spatial smoothing (FWHM 12 mm). A high-pass ﬁlter with a cut off of 128 s was used to correct for low-frequency components. Statistical analyses were performed using the general linear model (as implemented in SPM5). On the ﬁrst level, for each participant a design matrix was created using a canonical hemodynamic response function for the following conditions: threat and safety, each divided into two blocks (ﬁrst half of the experiment: mean of the red/green slides 1 to 3—and second half: mean of the red/green slides 4 to 6), as well as the ﬁxation cross period which all together constituted the regressors. The six movement parameters estimated during the realignment were introduced into the model as covariates to control for variance caused by head displacements. This resulted in the output of 12 beta-estimates (4 threat conditions (threat and safe periods each divided into ﬁrst and second half), 1 ﬁxation cross period, 6 movement parameters, 1 constant). Beta estimates of the 4 threat conditions, separately for low and high fear groups, were then taken to the second level full factorial model.  Contrast maps were created on the basis of simple t-contrasts (threat>safe; safe>threat) that were then analyzed for the entire sample. After the whole brain analysis, small volume corrected analyses were conducted for the regions of interest (ROI) (anterior insula, OFC, ACC, dmPFC) using masks provided by the “Automated Anatomical Labeling” software (AAL; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). The statistical threshold was set to p b0.05 (family wise error (FWE) corrected; Brown and Russell, 1997). MNI-coordinates of the highest activated voxels are reported in the Results section. For the between group analyses (high>low fear) and analyses regarding differences between the blocks (threat>safe ﬁrst half; threat>safe second half of the experiment), parameter estimates (betas of the full factorial model, 10 mm sphere) were extracted to SPSS 19.0 (SPSS for Windows, SPSS Inc.).1 Possible relations of personality traits (questionnaire scores) and brain activation were investigated using bivariate Pearson correlations (.05 level of signiﬁcance). ANOVAs and t-tests to check for group differences and effects in subjective report data were also accomplished using SPSS 19.0. In addition to the factors introduced in the analysis of startle response and symptom reports, the factor Time was entered as a within-subjects factor in the analysis of verbal anxiety and tension reports concerning the scanning procedure.

During anticipation of body symptoms, all participants reported more severe panic symptoms, higher anxiety, tension, and unpleasantness than during the anticipation of safety, Condition, F(4, 24)=29.15, p b.001. Again, high fear participants reported overall more anxiety than participants with low fear, Group F(4, 24)=5.63, p b.01. All means and statistical analyses of the verbal report data can be obtained from Supplementary Table 1.  Startle response magnitudes  Startle response magnitudes were signiﬁcantly potentiated when elicited during viewing of threat compared to safety signals, Condition, F(1, 27)=17.04, p b.001. Moreover, startle response magnitudes were signiﬁcantly larger for high compared to low fear persons, Group, F(1, 27)=4.64, p b.05. These group differences were more pronounced during the anticipation of interoceptive threat, t(27)= 2.23, p b.05, and only marginally signiﬁcant during safety periods, t(27)=1.90, p= .07 (see Fig. 2B).  fMRI session  Verbal report measures  High fear participants rated the scanner environment as more aversive than low fear subjects, Group, F(1, 26)=31.33, p b.001. Tension ratings, as well as anxiety ratings were signiﬁcantly higher for high fear compared to low fear participants prior to the fMRI experiment2 (tension: M (SD) =4.1 (2.2) vs. 1.1 (1.3); anxiety: M (SD) = 3.1 (2.2) vs. 0.7 (1.2) for high and low fear participants, respectively, t(26)=4.54, p b.001 and t(26)=3.60, p b.01, for tension and anxiety ratings respectively) and during the scanning procedure (tension: M (SD) =5.7 (2.3) vs. 1.5 (1.5); anxiety: M (SD)=3.9 (2.5) vs. 0.8 (1.5) for high and low fear subjects, respectively, t(26)=5.76, p b.001 and t(26)=3.94, p=.001, for tension and anxiety ratings respectively). Tension and anxiety ratings signiﬁcantly decreased after the scanning procedure, particularly in the high fear group (tension: M (SD)=1.1 (1.0) vs. 0.2 (0.6); anxiety: M (SD)=0.6 (1.1) vs. 0.1 (0.3) for high and low fear participants, respectively, Time, F(2, 52)= 41.69, p b.001.  fMRI data  Whole brain analysis  Fig. 3 depicts activated voxels for the contrast threat>safe in the whole brain analysis for the entire sample.

The only signiﬁcant activation going beyond the regions of interest in the whole brain analysis was a cluster in the right supramarginal/angular gyrus.  ROI analyses  ROI analyses supported the whole brain analysis. Processing of the cue that predicted the occurrence of the hyperventilation task was associated with signiﬁcantly increased activations in the anterior insula/orbitofrontal region (OFC) and rostral parts of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dACC/dmPFC) when compared to the activation elicited during processing of the safety cue (see Table 3).  Between group comparisons  Participants with high fear of somatic symptoms showed overall stronger activation in the right anterior insula/OFC during processing of the threat cue than did persons with low fear of somatic symptoms (all MNI coordinates as presented in Table 3; anterior insula/OFC R: Group, t(27)=2.38, p b.05. Activation was also stronger in the anterior insula/OFC L: Group, t(27)=1.95, p=.06 and rostral dACC/dmPFC: Group, t(27)=1.71, p=.10, marginally signiﬁcant). High fear participants also showed stronger activation in this network during processing of the safety cue compared to low fear participants (anterior insula/OFC R: Group, t(27)=2.18, p b.05, n.s. in anterior insula/OFC L and rostral dACC/dmPFC). Due to this increased activation during processing of the safety cue in the high fear participants the overall between group comparison of the activation differences between threat and safety cues was not signiﬁcant. Fig. 4A illustrates these overall between group effects in the different regions of interest.  During the learning session the hyperventilation task was delivered after the third threat cue. During the session in the scanner the third cue was not followed by the hyperventilation task. Therefore the activation during the ﬁrst three trials of threat and safety cues (block 1) was compared with the last three trials (block 2). Increased activation during processing of the threat cues compared to the safety cues was overall signiﬁcantly larger during the ﬁrst block compared to the second block, Condition×Block, Fs(1, 27)=8.37, 14.84, all ps b.05, for the anterior insula/OFC L and rostral dACC/dmPFC, respectively. This pattern of activation, however, differed between groups. While low fear participants showed signiﬁcant conditioning effects in these ROIs only consistently during block 1 of the experiment, but not during block 2, high fear participants continued to show increased activation of this network during processing of the threat cue throughout the entire experiment (see statistics in Table 4). Fig. 4B illustrates these group differences in the activation pattern for the rostral dACC/dmPFC.  862  K. Holtz et al. / NeuroImage 61 (2012) 857–865  Fig. 3.

Activation foci are overlaid on a T1 reference brain (position of the slice indicated above the image).  Correlation analyses  Correlation analyses between reports of fear of somatic symptoms as assessed by the BSQ and potentiation of activation during processing of the threat compared to the safety cues showed strongest associations between reported fear of somatic symptoms and increase in activation in the rostral dACC/dmPFC. As depicted in Fig. 5, the increase in activation (threat–safe) in the rostral dACC/ dmPFC was signiﬁcantly correlated with the participants' score in the Body Sensations Questionnaire, rPearson =.492, p b.01. Moreover, a signiﬁcant correlation between the BSQ scores and the increase in activation (threat–safe) in the anterior insula was observed during the second block of the experiment, rPearson=.387, p b.05.  Discussion  The present study investigated the neural network activated during anticipation of a hyperventilation task. We found increased activations of the anterior insula/OFC and the rostral dACC/dmPFC during processing of cues that predicted the occurrence of a hyperventilation task that reliably evoked somatic symptoms in all participants. Increased activation of this neural network, however, was more sustained in high fear compared to low fear persons. High fear participants also showed clear fear potentiated startle and reported more severe panic symptoms during anticipation of body symptoms. Moreover, these individuals reported higher tension prior to and during the fMRI session. Correlation analyses supported the association between the fear of somatic symptoms—as assessed  Table 2 Signiﬁcant activations during threat vs. safe condition in the whole sample (whole brain analysis) with MNI coordinates and cluster size (kE).

Neural network activated during the anticipation of interoceptive threat  Cues that predicted the occurrence of a hyperventilation task activated a neural network involving the anterior insula/orbitofrontal cortex and rostral parts of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Increased activations of the dACC/dmPFC and the insula have formerly consistently been found during anticipation of electric shock or aversive pictures (for review see Mechias et al., 2010), suggesting that anticipation of unpleasant somatic symptoms activates the same neural network that is activated during the anticipation of exteroceptive threat. Interestingly, no increased activation of the amygdala was found during the anticipation of interoceptive threat. In the current experiment, participants were instructed that a hyperventilation challenge would follow one but not the other cue, and increased activation of the amygdala have not consistently been found under these instructed fear conditions. Accordingly, while activation of the amygdala has been reported during the pharmacological challenge (Eser et al., 2009), no amygdala activation was found during the anticipation of injection of CCK-4 in this study. Together with the data of the current experiment this pattern of results supports recent learning theory perspectives on the etiology of panic disorder that clearly separates between panic attacks as an acute ﬁght–ﬂight response (presumably involving the activation of the amygdala) and the emotional state anticipatory anxiety characterized by hypervigilance of somatic symptoms and anxious apprehension (Bouton et al., 2001; Mineka and Zinbarg, 2006). Moreover, increased activation of the insular cortex has been associated with increased awareness of somatic symptoms (Critchley et al., 2004). Accordingly, increased activation in the anterior insula during anticipation of hyperventilation would also support the hypothesis of increased hypervigilance during anxious apprehension of unpleasant somatic symptoms.  In the context of instructed fear paradigms Mechias et al. (2010) reported activation in the dmPFC, as a region involved in the  Table 3 Signiﬁcant activations during threat vs. safe condition in the whole sample (ROI analyses).

Correlation of BSQ score and rostral dACC/dmPFC activation (mean parameter estimates from the cluster (10 mm sphere) of maximum activation during threat> safe).  the current study, the stronger activation in the supramarginal gyrus during threat but not during safety might be related to the activation of a motor program that is involved in the action tendency to escape. The activation of a neural network that is typically found during anticipation of aversive events (Chua et al., 1999; Nitschke et al., 2006; Straube et al., 2007) is in line with this interpretation.  High vs. low fear of somatic symptoms  Brain activation of participants reporting high fear of somatic symptoms differed from the activation of participants with low fear in two ways. First participants reporting high fear of somatic symptoms showed overall stronger startle potentiation and stronger activations in the anterior insula/OFC and the rostral dACC/dmPFC both during the threat and (in insula/OFC) the safe conditions compared to the controls. These data suggest that these participants showed overall higher anxious apprehension in the experimental context compared to the low fear group. The verbal report data are in line with such an interpretation. High fear participants reported more tension and anxiety prior to and during the experimental procedures. Thus, although the activation of the anterior insula/OFC and the rostral dACC/dmPFC was stronger during anticipation of hyperventilation as compared to the safe condition in both groups, high fear participants showed an overall sensitization effect. These data are in line with a recent study from Nitschke et al. (2009) who found that patients with generalized anxiety disorder showed generally increased ACC activation during the anticipation of both aversive and neutral pictures, suggesting the same sensitizing effect of the context in this group of patients. Furthermore, those patients who showed the strongest pretreatment activation in this area also showed the strongest reduction in reported anxiety and worries after treatment. Second, low fear participants showed modest startle potentiation and stronger activation of the network described above during processing of the threat compared to the safety cue in the ﬁrst block (trials 1–3) suggesting that the hyperventilation task might also be slightly aversive for low fear participants. Indeed the quite strenuous hyperventilation  Fig. 4. A. Activation in ROIs during safe and threat conditions.

Especially the region around rostral dACC/dmPFC has been found to be activated during anticipatory anxiety in several studies (Kalisch et al., 2005, 2006b). The peak activation at 3/42/27 very closely corresponds to the coordinates reported by Kalisch et al. (2005, 2006a) that were derived from different imaging studies on anticipatory anxiety (Kalisch et al., 2006b; Mechias et al., 2010; Raczka et al., 2010). In line with this research, high fear participants displayed increased activation in the rostral dACC/dmPFC during a task in which unpleasant body symptoms were anticipated.  The increased activation of the right supramarginal gyrus has previously been reported by Schienle et al. (2005) who presented fearrelevant stimuli to patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder.

Holtz et al. / NeuroImage 61 (2012) 857–865  challenge was designed to induce somatic symptoms in all participants, and low fear participants also experienced unpleasant somatic symptoms. Moreover, previous data from our laboratory clearly showed that low fearful participants also report experiencing unpleasant somatic symptoms—albeit less intense than high fear participants—during the anticipation of the hyperventilation challenge (Melzig et al., 2008). After the third presentation of the threat cue, activation during threat no longer differed from that evoked by the safe cue suggesting that anticipatory anxiety waned in low fearful participants. In contrast, the high fear group continued to show fear potentiated startle and stronger activation during processing of the threat cue in the anterior insula/OFC and the rostral dACC/dmPFC. Anxious apprehension of somatic symptoms during the threat cue was maintained even though participants did not experience any further hyperventilation challenge. These data again support clinical data from Grillon and colleagues who found that patients with panic disorders show an overgeneralization of their defensive response mobilization and a reduction in safety learning (Grillon et al., 2008; Lissek et al., 2010).  Although the breathing patterns of high and low fear participants were identical during the hyperventilation challenge high fear participants reported more intense panic symptoms during this task, suggesting that high fear participants evaluated these somatic symptoms as much more threatening. The increased co-activation of the anterior insula/OFC and the rostral dACC/dmPFC during the anticipation of such symptoms in high fear participants might index the neural network involved in such appraisal process. Correlation analyses support such interpretation.  Correlations between brain activation and self report measures  Scores in the BSQ—a questionnaire that measures the person's anxiety concerning somatic symptoms and how much these bodily symptoms are interpreted as threatening—correlated signiﬁcantly with an increase in activation during threat compared to safe in the rostral dACC/dmPFC. The rostral dmPFC is consistently activated during instructed fear paradigms suggesting that this area might be involved in the conscious appraisal of threat (see Mechias et al., 2010). Participants who evaluated somatic symptoms as more threatening showed stronger activation of this region during processing of cues that predicted the occurrence of such symptoms. Moreover, positive correlations between the BSQ scores and the anterior insula during the second half the experiment also support previous data from Melzig et al. (2008), demonstrating that participants with high fear of somatic symptoms also show increased autonomic arousal as indexed by elevated skin conductance responses during the anticipation of such symptoms.  Conclusions  In the current experiment, participants learned that one of two cues was associated with a hyperventilation challenge that successfully evoked unpleasant somatic symptoms in all participants. Presenting these cues later, in a scanner environment, to the same individuals reliably activated a neural network in the brain including the anterior insula/OFC and the rostral dACC/dmPFC, a network that has been reported frequently in other instructed fear studies using exteroceptive aversive stimuli. Although the anticipation of unpleasant somatic symptoms activated this network in all participants, high fear persons showed an overall stronger activation in this network, indicating an increased sensitization probably evoked by the unpleasant experimental environment. The increased anxiety and tension ratings obtained from these participants support such interpretation. Moreover, high fear participants maintained the increased activation during anticipation of the somatic symptoms throughout the entire experiment despite that the hyperventilation challenge was no longer required, suggesting that increased anxious apprehension of somatic symptoms is associated with  the activation of this network. The signiﬁcant correlation of rostral dACC/dmPFC activation, that plays a major role in conscious threat appraisal and the explicit evaluation of threat (Etkin et al., 2011; Mechias et al., 2010; Raczka et al., 2010), with a trait measure of fear of somatic symptoms substantiates the assumption that the current paradigm might be an innovative method to study anxious apprehension of unpleasant somatic sensations in clinical samples like patients with panic disorder or somatoform disorders.

Introduction  The effects of task conditions on brain activation to emotional stimuli are poorly understood. In this event-related fMRI study, brain activation to negative and positive words (matched for arousal) and neutral words was investigated under two task conditions. Subjects either had to attend to the emotional meaning (direct task) or to non-emotional features of the words (indirect task). Regardless of task, positive vs. negative words led to increased activation in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, while negative vs. positive words induced increased activation of the insula. Compared to neutral words, all emotional words were associated with increased activation of the amygdala. Finally, the direct condition, as compared to the indirect condition, led to enhanced activation to emotional vs. neutral words in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest valence and arousal dependent brain activation patterns that are partially modulated by participants’ processing mode of the emotional stimuli.  © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.  Although there is increasing evidence for the role of several brain areas in the processing of emotional stimuli, the effects of task conditions and speciﬁc emotional aspects of stimuli on brain responses is a matter of debate. One line of research concerns the brain areas, which are involved in the processing of valence and arousal of emotional stimuli and the modulation of brain activation by the task-dependent attentional focus of subjects (e.g. [1,2]).  In general, there is increasing evidence for an involvement of several brain regions in the processing of emotionally salient stimuli regardless of its valence. Thus, several functional imaging studies found similarly strong activation of the amygdala to unpleasant and pleasant pictures [3–5], negative and positive words (e.g. [6–8]) and other kinds of negative and positive emotional stimuli [9,10]. These ﬁndings are in line with the hypothesis that the amygdala is involved in the processing of arousal or general relevance of stimuli [11]. The amygdala seems to be involved in modulating the vigilance level and memory functions concerning relevant stimuli [12,13]. In addition to the amygdala, other regions have been described being activated predominantly by arousal of stimuli such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [14,15]. These areas are implicated in emotional–cognitive interactions, including the general aware ∗ Corresponding author: Tel.: +49 3641 9 45 154; fax: +49 3641 9 45 142.

In contrast to these regions, activation of other areas has been shown to depend more strongly on the valence of stimuli. Thus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) seems to be more strongly responsive to positive valence (e.g. [14,24]) and the insula to negative valence (e.g. [4,6,25]).  However, activation to emotional stimuli depends on experimental conditions. Several studies showed that task conditions modulate the effect of valence on brain activation, particularly in the amygdala [4,19,23,26]. For example, threat-related vs. neutral or positive pictorial stimuli lead to greater amygdala activation during implicit as compared to explicit emotional tasks [1,19,20,23,27,28]. Furthermore, a previous study suggested increased amygdala activation to negative vs. positive pictures (matched for arousal) when subjects attended to a matching task in the foreground of the pictures [1]. In another study, fearful facial expressions elicited stronger amygdala activation than happy facial expressions during distraction from faces while the reversed effect was evident when subject’s attention was focused on faces [26]. These studies provided evidence that negative pictures lead to stronger amygdala activation than positive pictures when attention is distracted from the emotional content of pictures, which might be due to prioritized detection of danger in the environment [29]. Effects of task conditions on brain activation to emotional stimuli have been also found for other brain areas. Explicit emotional tasks seem to increase activation to emotional stimuli in the DMPFC, ACC, and insula (e.g. [15,20]), for example, emotion discrimination of emotional faces [19] or emotional evaluation of complex visual  T. Straube et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 222 (2011) 66–72  67  scenes [30]. Thus, brain responses to emotional stimuli seem to be neither a simple function of stimuli valence nor of arousal. Speciﬁc experimental conditions, such as modulation of spatial, feature- or emotion-based attention, can modulate the relation between brain activation and emotional stimuli.  While brain activation to pictorial stimuli with positive and negative valence such as faces and complex emotional scenes has been repeatedly investigated by functional neuroimaging studies (e.g. [1,15,30–34]), there are only a few imaging studies on the processing of negative vs. positive emotional words (e.g. [6–8,35,36]). In contrast to most pictorial stimuli, emotional words represent highly symbolic emotional stimuli that acquire personal signiﬁcance during ontogenetic learning [37]. However, words are also associated with a strong modulation of brain activation [37–40]. Thus, it can be expected that emotional words represent powerful emotional cues which evoke brain activation in emotion-related brain areas. Hamann and Mao [7], for example, reported comparable amygdala activation to positive and negative words during a passive viewing condition in a block design fMRI study. The authors proposed that the amygdala response is only determined by the strength of emotional arousal. Lewis et al. [36] presented emotional words and asked subjects to indicate whether the words described the subjects themselves. This study found that the activation of the amygdala correlated with stimulus arousal and activation in subregions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) correlated with stimulus valence. Recently, increased activation of the amygdala to positive vs. negative adjectives during passive viewing has been reported [8]. Notably, there is only one study that investigated the effect of task conditions (emotional vs. non-emotional evaluation of words) on neural correlates of processing negative and positive words in healthy subjects to date [6]. However, in this study, a speciﬁc category of emotional words indicating the word’s social relevancy was used. Positive and negative words were not matched for arousal and behavioural data were not reported, making the interpretation of the ﬁndings of this study somewhat difﬁcult. Nevertheless, results showed that arousal led to activation of the amygdala independently of the task condition and negative valence correlated with activation of the insula.  The current event-related fMRI study was aimed at a detailed investigation of the role of task conditions on neural correlates of processing emotional words. Subjects were exposed to carefully matched neutral, negative, and positive words while solving a direct and indirect task with respect to the emotional meaning of the words. The direct task required an explicit decision on the valence of words by the participants. In the indirect task, subjects had to identify the case of the word, which involves some degree of meaning-based evaluation of the words, but no explicit attention to emotional relevance. Notably, this task needs more attention to word meaning than other implicit tasks, such as lexical decision (word or non-word; e.g. [35,41]). Comparing the direct and the indirect task should speciﬁcally isolate the effect of attention to emotional meaning of words without confounding factors. In particular, this study investigated, based on ﬁndings with pictorial stimuli, the hypotheses that negative words, compared to positive words, induce increased amygdala activation speciﬁcally in the indirect task, that valence should differentially modulate activation in the VMPFC and the insula, for the latter region most pronounced during the explicit condition, and that the direct vs. indirect condition should be associated with increased activation to emotional stimuli in dorsal midline prefrontal regions.  2. Methods and materials  2.1. Subjects  Eighteen healthy subjects (16 females; mean age: 21.5, range: 18–28 years) participated in the study. All participants were right-handed university students with  normal or to normal corrected vision and native speakers of the German language. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Jena and written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the experiment.  2.2. Stimuli and procedures  Word stimuli consisted of 20 negative, 20 positive, and 20 neutral words (in each emotional category 12 nouns, 3 adjectives, and 5 verbs), which were matched for numbers of syllables and word frequency of German language (COSMAS II database, http://www.ids-mannheim.de/cosmas2/). Words were chosen according to the valence and arousal ratings of 23 subjects who did not participate in the fMRI experiment. Based on Likert scales varying between 1 and 9 (for valence: 1 = most negative, 9 = most positive; for arousal: 1 = no arousal, 9 = highest arousal), mean valence of the chosen words was 2.46± 0.18 (negative words), 7.25± 0.18 (positive words), and 5.02± 0.06 (neutral words) and mean arousal was 5.34± 0.27 (negative words), 5.46± 0.43 (positive words), and 2.18± 0.13 (neutral words). Thus, negative and positive words were matched for arousal. There was a balanced distribution of stimuli per word class across stimulus valence but with different number of stimuli per word class. Furthermore, a second independent sample (n = 18) rated the words for concreteness, since concreteness per se may modulate neural responses (e.g. [42,43]). Concreteness is related to concrete concepts such as “apple” or “table” compared to words describing abstract concepts such as “love” or “peace”. Values differed between 1 and 9, with 1 indicating abstract and 9 indicating concrete words. Analysis of ratings showed comparable concreteness ratings across valence [F(2,59) = 1.27, p > 0.05]: 6.24± 0.27 (negative words), 5.84± 0.37 (positive words), and 6.58± 0.34 (neutral words). During scanning, these 20 positive, 20 negative, and 20 neutral stimuli were presented twice each run in random order via a backprojection screen onto an overhead mirror. Each word was presented for 1000 ms in capital letters to avoid an easy discrimination of word class (see indirect task). Additionally, 40 null events (a ﬁxation cross indistinguishable from the ﬁxation cross presented during the inter-stimulus intervals [44]) were randomly intermixed into the sequence of stimuli. Stimulus onset asynchrony between two succeeding word stimuli was 4470 ms. The same words were presented under two task conditions (one condition per run). In the direct task, subjects were asked to determine the emotional valence (positive, negative, or neutral) of the presented word. In the indirect task, subjects had to decide whether the word represented a noun, an adjective, or a verb. For judgement, subjects pressed one of three buttons of an optic ﬁber response box with either the index or the middle ﬁnger of the right hand or the index ﬁnger of the left hand. Accuracy and response time of judgements were recorded using Experimental Runtime System (ERTS) software (Version 3.29; BeriSoft Corporation, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). The order of tasks and assignment of response buttons to the response alternatives were counterbalanced across subjects. After the fMRIsession, participants rated the words using a nine-point Likert-scale to assess the valence (1 = ‘very negative’ to 9 = ‘very positive’) and arousal (1 = ‘not arousing’ to 9 = ‘very arousing’) of each single word. Behavioural data were analyzed by means of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS (Version 17; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A probability level of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant. All data are expressed by mean± SEM (standard error of mean). Due to technical problems, reaction times and accuracy as well as valence and arousal ratings from two participants could not be analyzed.  2.3.  fMRI  In the 1.5 T magnetic resonance scanner (“Magnetom Vision plus”, Siemens Medical Systems), two runs were measured using a T2* weighted echo-planar sequence (TE = 50 ms, ﬂip angle = 90◦, matrix = 64× 64, FOV = 192 mm, TR = 2.98 s). Each run comprised 246 volumes of 30 axial slices (thickness = 3 mm, gap = 1 mm, in plane resolution = 3 mm× 3 mm). To minimize susceptibility artifacts in inferior parts of anterior brain areas the volumes were acquired with a tilted slice orientation [45]. Additionally, a high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical volume was recorded. Preprocessing and analysis of functional data were performed using the software Brain Voyager QX (Version 1.6; Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). To ensure that steady-state tissue magnetization was reached, the ﬁrst four volumes of each run were excluded from analysis. The volumes were realigned to the ﬁrst volume in order to minimize effects of head movements on data analysis. Further data preprocessing comprised a correction for slice time errors and spatial [8 mm full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel (FWHMK)] as well as temporal (high pass ﬁlter: 5 cycles per run; low pass ﬁlter: 2800 ms FWHMK) smoothing. Anatomical and functional images were co-registered and normalized to the Talairach space [46]. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression of the signal time course at each voxel including a correction for serial correlations. The expected blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal change for each event type (=predictor) was modelled by a canonical hemodynamic response function. Within- and between-group statistical comparisons were conducted using a mixed effect analysis, which considers inter-subject variance and permits population-level inferences. In the ﬁrst step, voxelwise statistical maps were generated and the relevant, planned contrasts of predictor estimates (beta-weights) were computed for each individual. In the second step, a random effects group analysis of these individual contrasts was performed. Analysis was conducted in speciﬁc regions of interest (ROI). The following ROIs were chosen based on the studies and ﬁndings described in the introduction  68  Table 1 Performance data.  T.

The anatomical ROIs were deﬁned according to our previous studies (e.g. [4,19,37]) using Talairach daemon software [47,48]. Statistical parametric maps resulting from voxelwise analysis were considered statistically signiﬁcant for clusters that survived a correction for multiple comparisons. We used the approach as implemented in Brain Voyager [49], which is based on a 3D extension of the randomization procedure described by Forman et al. [50]. Firstly, voxel-level threshold was set at p < 0.005 (uncorrected). Thresholded maps were then submitted to a ROIbased correction for multiple comparisons. The correction criterion was based on the estimate of the maps spatial smoothness and on an iterative procedure (Monte Carlo Simulation) for estimating cluster-level false-positive rates. After 1000 iterations, the minimum cluster size threshold that yielded a cluster-level false-positive rate of 5% was applied to the statistical maps.  3. Results  3.1. Behavioural data  Accuracy, i.e., the number of correct responses, was high during the indirect task (see Table 1 for descriptive data) and did not differ signiﬁcantly between the three valence categories [F(2,30) = .09, p > 0.05].

For the reversed contrast, stronger activation in the right anterior insula to negative vs. positive words was  found (coordinates of peak voxel [x, y, z]: 37, 6, 14; t(17) = 3.28; cluster size: 1353 mm3; p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons; see Fig. 2).  3.2.3.

We only found increased activation in the DMPFC in the direct vs. indirect task (coordinates of peak voxel [x, y, z]: 0, 55, 20; t(17) = 4.00; cluster size: 682 mm3; p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons), which is mainly caused by increased activation to the arousing vs. neutral words during the direct task (see essentially the same signiﬁcant cluster for the interaction of task and arousal described above; see also Fig. 3).  4. Discussion  In the present study, we used event-related fMRI to examine brain activation to emotional words under different emotional task conditions. Regardless of task, positive vs. negative words led to increased activation in the VMPFC, while negative vs. positive words caused increased activation in the insula. Compared to neutral words, both negative and positive words caused increased activation in the amygdala. Finally, the direct condition vs. the indirect condition led to enhanced activation during the processing of emotional words in the DMPFC and the ACC.  The ﬁndings for the main effect of valence are in accordance with previous ﬁndings. A main effect of valence with increased activation to positive vs. negative stimuli was found in the VMPFC in several studies, even though this effect was mostly demonstrated for pictures [14] or for conditioned stimuli [51]. Here, we show that compared to negative words, positive words increase activation in the VMPFC. This is independent of the speciﬁc task or informationprocessing mode. The VMPFC activity is strongly associated with  control of appetitive behavior, processing of safety signals and of rewarding information (e.g., [52–54]). Activation to positive words might be associated with these functions of the VMPFC.  The insula showed stronger activation to negative words. Although the insula is not only involved in the processing of negative stimuli, a preferential role in processing negative stimuli has been suggested (e.g., [4]). Based on the role of the insula in interoception [17], current theories hypothesize that the insula is involved in emotional experience, particular in situations of realized dangers [4,17,19–21,55–57]. The right insular cortex, especially the anterior part, represents arousal states of the organism and seems to integrate various sources of interoceptive information [56]. The current study provides evidence that also symbolic negative verbal cues activate the insula, suggesting that these cues might modulate the representation of bodily states. Although previous studies suggested increased insula activation during explicit vs. implicit emotional processing of pictorial stimuli (e.g. [20,27]), the current study found no modulation of activation as a function of task requirements. This observation suggests that the activation of the insula is independent of whether attention is explicitly focused on the emotional meaning of words or not, at least with the kind of task manipulation used in this study. Future studies using tasks that distract attention from the words might investigate the limits of the insular activation.  Furthermore, emotional to neutral words caused stronger activation of the amygdala regardless of stimulus valence and task conditions. As described in the introduction, there is an ongoing debate whether valence, arousal, or other aspects of emotional stimuli, such as relevance, are relevant for the magnitude of amyg T. Straube et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 222 (2011) 66–72  71  dala activation [3,4,9,10,19,20,58–62]. Several studies are in line with the hypothesis that the amygdala decodes arousal of stimuli regardless of valence ([6,9,10,58,60]; but see [63,64]). However, recent studies provided evidence that activation of the amygdala and other emotion-relevant brain areas might vary according to an interaction of valence and speciﬁc experimental tasks [1,26]. For example, we found stronger amygdala activation to negative vs. positive pictorial stimuli when the emotional stimuli were not task-relevant [1]. These results suggest a critical role of the amygdala for the rapid and automatic processing of aversive pictorial stimuli, while more detailed processing of stimuli may modulate initial valence-speciﬁc effects.  For word stimuli, Hamann et al. [60] showed comparable amygdala activation to positive and negative words during a passive viewing condition in a block design fMRI study. The authors proposed that the amygdala response is only determined by the strength of emotional arousal. Other authors reported increased activation to positive vs. negative adjectives during passive viewing [8]. In an event-related fMRI study by Cunningham et al. [6], subjects had to solve either an explicit (good–bad decision) or an implicit emotional task (lexical decision). Similar to the results of the present study, the authors also did not ﬁnd any (taskdependent) effect of valence (bad or good words) on amygdala activation. It has to be noted that other tasks which distract attention not only from further emotional evaluation of words but from the semantic context or even from the words by means of foreground tasks (for studies with pictorial stimuli see [1,20]) or spatial distraction [65,66] might reveal other ﬁndings. An optimal attentional load might be a prerequisite to elicit valence-speciﬁc brain activation [67]. Further studies are needed to investigate these questions in more detail.  In the present study, emotional vs. neutral stimuli led to increased activation in the DMPFC and ACC during the direct task as compared to the indirect task. These areas have been proposed to be involved in cognitive–emotional interactions, including selfreferential emotional processing [30,32,33]. Thus, these areas are more involved in explicit emotional judgements, while subcortical areas such as the amygdala have been proposed to mediate bottom-up processing of emotional stimuli [1,66]. Several studies showed increased dorsal medial prefrontal activation during emotional vs. non-emotional judgements concerning emotional stimuli [15,19,30,32,33]. This brain region is implicated in highlevel appraisal processes and has been shown to be involved in the assessment of the emotional signiﬁcance of stimuli and situations [15,18,19,68–71]. Our ﬁndings support this notion, since explicit attention to the emotional meaning of words, which means appraisal of emotional signiﬁcance, increased activation in the DMPFC and the rostral ACC.  A possible limitation of the current study is the fact that the repeated presentation of the same list of words may have weakened the differences between tasks, since once participants had attended to the case or emotion or the words, they may have automatically done so again upon its second presentation. Future studies might counterbalance, for example, different sets of words across participants. Furthermore, future studies might use manipulations of spatial or feature-based attention to investigate further the role of attention in the neural processing of emotional words. The inclusion of self report measure (mood, state or trait anxiety) might also reveal interactions between task, the induced attentional focus and brain activation to stimuli with positive vs. negative valence. Furthermore, the lack of task effects on activation in the amygdala and insula is in contrast to several previous studies using other stimuli. Words, as compared to other stimuli, may differ in elicited arousal or the automaticity of attentional allocation. Future studies should investigate these points by directly comparing brain and behavioural responses to different stimulus types.  In conclusion, using event-related fMRI, we revealed that regardless of experimental conditions positive vs. negative words led to increased activation in the VMPFC. For the contrast negative vs. positive words increased activation in the insula was found. Compared to neutral words, both negative and positive words caused increased activation in the amygdala. Finally, the direct condition, as compared with the indirect condition, led to enhanced activation to emotional vs. neutral words in the DMPFC and the ACC. These results suggest that the pattern of brain activation in response to stimuli with different valence and arousal quality is partially modulated by task conditions.

These sensations are atypical, arising from sub-dermal receptors, and their neural encoding is not well known. In this fMRI study, subjects were stimulated at acupoint PC-6, while rating sensation with a custom-built, MR-compatible potentiometer. Separate runs included real (ACUP) and sham (SHAM) acupuncture, the latter characterized by non-insertive, cutaneous stimulation. FMRI data analysis was guided by the on-line rating timeseries, thereby localizing brain correlates of acupuncture sensation. Sensation ratings correlated with stimulation more (p b 0.001) for SHAM (r=0.63) than for ACUP (r=0.32). ACUP induced stronger and more varied sensations with signiﬁcant persistence into no-stimulation blocks, leading to more run-time spent rating low and moderate sensations compared to SHAM. ACUP sensation correlated with activation in regions associated with sensorimotor (SII, insula) and cognitive (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)) processing, and deactivation in default-mode network (DMN) regions (posterior cingulate, precuneus). Compared to SHAM, ACUP yielded greater activity in both anterior and posterior dmPFC and dlPFC. In contrast, SHAM produced greater activation in sensorimotor (SI, SII, insula) and greater deactivation in DMN regions. Thus, brain encoding of ACUP sensation (more persistent and varied, leading to increased cognitive load) demonstrated greater activity in both cognitive/evaluative (posterior dmPFC) and emotional/interoceptive (anterior dmPFC) cortical regions. Increased cognitive load and dmPFC activity may be a salient component of acupuncture analgesia — sensations focus attention and accentuate bodily awareness, contributing to enhanced top-down modulation of any nociceptive afference and central pain networks. Hence, acupuncture may function as a somatosensory-guided mind–body therapy.  © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  Acupuncture therapy originated in China over 2500 years ago, but its mechanisms of action are not well understood. Acupuncture involves puncture of the skin with a thin, solid shaft needle. Subsequent manipulation of this needle can then be accomplished by twisting the needle handle between two ﬁngers. The associated sub-dermal trauma serves to stimulate nerve receptors both directly and indirectly through mechanical coupling via the connective tissue surrounding the needle (Langevin et al., 2002). The sensations induced by acupuncture needling are one of its unique characteristics. These sensations, sometimes referred to as deqi (Kong et al., 2007a; Park et al., 2002; Vincent et al., 1989), include aching, numbness, tingling, and even warmth, encompassing several different psycho ⁎ Corresponding authors.

Importantly, the attainment of these sensations in a clinical setting has been linked in many traditional Chinese medicine texts (Cheng, 1996) with successful therapeutic outcomes. Deqi sensation produces greater local blood ﬂow at the needle site compared to simple needle insertion (Sandberg et al., 2003). Furthermore, experimental studies have found correlation between the intensity of different acupuncture sensations and subsequent analgesia (Kong et al., 2005). The brain correlates of acupuncture sensation might suggest how and why this sensation is connected to therapeutic outcome — a connection that is currently unknown.  The varied sensations evoked by acupuncture may arise following distinct combinations of afferent signaling. For instance, Wang et al. used electrophysiology to associate different sensations (“numbness,” “distention,” and “soreness”) to different ﬁber types (II, III, and IV respectively) (Wang et al., 1985). Moreover, as acupuncture sensations arise from deeper receptors located in fascia and/or muscle tissue, they are likely to have different somatosensory qualities and thus a relatively greater “novelty” compared to the  1056  V. Napadow et al. / NeuroImage 47 (2009) 1055–1065  more pedestrian sensations elicited by tactile stimulation of cutaneous receptors. While brain response to acupuncture likely plays an important role in therapeutic outcome, the speciﬁc neural correlates of acupuncture sensation have not been evaluated in an explicit manner.  Neuroimaging of acupuncture stimulation using functional MRI (fMRI) has been typically performed using a block design. The needle, inserted prior to the scan, is stimulated continuously for a duration ranging from 30 sec to 2 min during several ON blocks, interspersed between several OFF, or no-stimulation rest blocks. When using this block design as a general linear model (GLM) regressor to the fMRI data, an underlying assumption is that mechanoreceptor and nociceptor-associated afference, as well as the conscious perception and evaluation of is coincident with needle stimulation. However, recent studies have begun to question the equivalence of stimulation with sensation in block-design acupuncture experiments (Ho et al., 2008). As fMRI response to acupuncture has been found to necessitate conscious (awake) perception of the stimulation (Wang et al., 2007), the neural correlates of acupuncture sensation are likely to be important to brain processing during acupuncture.  this afference,  Exploring the neural correlates of sensation has been previously accomplished with percept-related fMRI — a technique wherein the subject performs on-line rating of sensation with the aid of visual guidance. The rating timeseries is then used to form GLM regressor(s) to the concurrently collected fMRI data. This approach has been used successfully to ﬁnd the neural correlates of prickle sensation (Davis et al., 2002), as well as the brain regions encoding both thermal and spontaneous pain in chronic pain patients (Baliki et al., 2006).  In our study, we have employed percept-related fMRI to evaluate the neural correlates of acupuncture sensation. We hypothesized that acupuncture sensation would persist into OFF-blocks following the stimulation ON-block, and that this persistence would be more robust for real (both cutaneous and deep receptors), compared to sham (cutaneous only) acupuncture. We further hypothesized that inherently atypical acupuncture sensations would evoke different ratingassociated brain response compared to that associated with sham acupuncture, which is characterized by more conventional cutaneousderived afferent input.  Methods  Subjects and experimental design  Fifteen (15) healthy, right-handed (Oldﬁeld, 1971) adults (8 female, 21–33 years of age) received both real manual acupuncture (ACUP) and sham acupuncture (SHAM) in one experimental session. Subjects were recruited via ﬂiers/newsletters adhering to MGH guidelines for distribution at neighboring academic institutions and hospitals. Subjects were screened to assure their safety and compatibility with MRI recording. All participants in the study provided written informed consent in accordance with the Human Research Committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital.  Both ACUP and SHAM runs consisted of a block design with ﬁve 30second stimulation blocks (ON), interspersed between six 30-second rest blocks (OFF). The total time for the block-design run was 5.5 min (Fig. 1). The order of ACUP and SHAM was pseudo-randomized across subjects to mitigate order effects. These two runs were also separated by structural and rest fMRI scans which ensured at least 25 min between successive stimulations. While adequate washout for acupuncture is unknown, sensation ratings taken before needle insertion (real or sham) in the latter stimulation scan conﬁrmed that subjects experienced no lasting sensations from the former stimulation scan. On-line acupuncture sensation was rated throughout both runs (see below).  All acupuncture was performed by the same licensed (and experienced) acupuncturist at acupoint PC-6 on the left forearm. This acupoint, which is on the volar aspect of the forearm, is 2 cun (approximately 5 cm) proximal to the transverse wrist crease, between the tendons of the palmaris longus and ﬂexor carpi radialis muscles. This point has been used clinically for cardiac conditions, as well as to control nausea and vomiting. It was chosen for this study due to its location overlying the median nerve and noted sensitivity, thus making it a good candidate to study interesting acupunctureinduced sensation patterns. For ACUP, acupuncture was performed by ﬁrst inserting a non-magnetic (pure silver), 0.23 mm diameter, 30 mm long acupuncture needle (Asahi Industry, Inc., Kawaguchi, Japan) into PC-6 to a depth of approximately 1.5 cm. During stimulation, the needle was manually twirled (∼ ±180°) approximately at 0.5 Hz.  Fig. 1. Experimental protocol. (A) A MR-compatible handheld potentiometer and rating dial was employed for on-line rating of acupuncture sensation. (B) Stimulation location (PC6) for both real (ACUP) and sham (SHAM) acupuncture. (C) The fMRI block-design paradigm consisted of alternating 30 s stimulation with 30 s rest blocks for both ACUP and SHAM. n.b. ﬁgure in (B) was modiﬁed from a image in ‘WHO Regional Ofﬁce for the Western Paciﬁc, 2008, WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Paciﬁc Region, Manila’.  V. Napadow et al. / NeuroImage 47 (2009) 1055–1065  1057  For SHAM, needle insertion was ﬁrst simulated by briskly poking the skin over PC-6 with a 5.88 von Frey monoﬁlament passed through a needle guide tube (similar to the one used for ACUP). During the scan run, the acupuncturist performed non-invasive cutaneous stimulation over the acupoint (tapping at 0.5 Hz) using the same monoﬁlament. Subjects were acupuncture-naive and were informed that there would be “different forms” of acupuncture during fMRI. Subjects lay supine in the scanner with their vision of distal body regions blocked by the MRI head coil, preventing them from viewing the intervention occurring at their periphery. SHAM aimed to control for both tactile stimulation of cutaneous somatosensory receptors over the acupoint, as well as the cognitive processing induced by subjects expecting “acupuncture” stimulation. Hence, the “speciﬁc effect” in ACUP that is not controlled for by SHAM is the stimulation of deep (sub-dermal) somatosensory receptors by the “invasive” acupuncture needle. Furthermore, non-insertive sham acupuncture stimulation is typically used as a placebo control in many acupuncture clinical trials; thus using this control in our study is warranted and relevant to the ﬁeld.  Psychophysical sensation data collection and analysis  During each scan run (on-line) as well as after (retrospective), subjects were asked to rate the sensation induced by ACUP and SHAM stimulation. For on-line rating, subjects were not informed about the block-design paradigm in the experiment, and were instructed to rate the sensation continuously throughout the entire run. On-line rating was accomplished by the use of a custom-built MR-compatible handheld potentiometer and rotating knob connected to a visual display projecting an intensity scale. While the potentiometer knob was set to traverse the entire rating range with minimal thumb/index ﬁnger twisting, sensitivity was limited by a ﬁnite fMRI-induced noise ﬂoor in the signal. The device was held in the dominant right arm, opposite to the acupuncture-stimulated arm. The visual feedback consisted of a 100 point visual analog scale (VAS), which contained only the following guidewords: “none” corresponding to 0, and “unbearable” corresponding to 100. Intermediate guidewords also included “mild,” which corresponded to a value of 20, “moderate,” which corresponded to 50, and “strong,” which corresponded to 80. Potentiometer response was acquired at 200 Hz with a laptop running Labview software (Labview 7.0, DAQCard 6024E, National Instruments, Austin, Texas).  For retrospective psychophysical data collection, following the ACUP and SHAM portions of the scan session, subjects were presented with a 10-point VAS and were asked to rate the intensity of different sensations they felt during the active stimulation run. The rated sensations were commonly associated with the experience of deqi (i.e. aching, soreness, pressure, heaviness, fullness, warmth, cool, numbness, tingling, and dull pain).  Several analyses of the on-line ratings were performed. Spearman correlation coefﬁcients were calculated to investigate the relationship between the on-line sensation ratings and the block design (which matches needle stimulation). A spectral analysis of the ratings time series was performed (MATLAB, Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) to compare the power spectral density (PSD) between ACUP and SHAM. Timeseries were ﬁrst linearly detrended to remove any DC offset. We then calculated power within the stimulation frequency band (0.0166±0.003 Hz), corresponding to our stimulus block design (30 s OFF and 30 s ON), as well as a low frequency band (0.001–0.0136 Hz) below the stimulation band. The PSD of both frequency bands was normalized by dividing by the total power (up to the ﬁrst harmonic of the stimulation frequency, or 0.03 Hz). We also calculated the time that subjects spent rating minimal (0–10), low (10–40), moderate (40–70), and high (70–100) intensity sensations. Comparisons between ACUP and SHAM were performed using a paired Students' t-test, signiﬁcant at alpha b0.05. The rating  time series were also used as regressors in the fMRI GLM analysis (described below).  We performed both a prevalence and intensity analysis for retrospective sensations. A sensation was counted as present if the intensity was greater than 0.5. Subjects were also asked to assess the intensity of throbbing, sharp pain (this sensation is not considered to be characteristic of deqi), and anxiety/relaxation. The anxiety/ relaxation scale ranged from very anxious (5) to fully relaxed (−5), with a zero (0) value signifying neither anxious nor relaxed. Additionally, subjects were asked to assess the extent of “spreading” that may have occurred for any of the listed sensations. A modiﬁed version of this procedure has been successfully used by our group in the past to assess psychophysical response in conjunction with neuroimaging (Hui et al., 2005; Napadow et al., 2005). In order to quantify the total intensity of deqi experienced we used the MGH Acupuncture Sensation Scale Index (MASS Index (Kong et al., 2007a)). This index attempts to balance breadth and depth of sensations as well as the number of different sensations chosen by the subject. The MASS Index and individual sensation intensities were compared between stimulation groups using a paired t-test, signiﬁcant at p b0.05 (SPSS 10.0.7, Chicago, Illinois). Furthermore, frequency counts of speciﬁc sensations were compared between stimulation type with a Pearson Chi-squared test, signiﬁcant at p b0.05. An omnibus test (Fisher's combined probability test) was used to test if the commonality of sensations elicited by ACUP differed from that elicited by SHAM. These data were also used in a previous report correlating acupuncture sensation with acupuncture effects on resting state connectivity (Dhond et al., 2008).  Imaging data collection and analysis  FMRI Data were acquired using a 3 T Siemens Tim Trio MRI System (Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) equipped for echo planer imaging with a 12-channel head coil. During scanning, subjects remained in the supine position with their heads immobilized by cushioned supports. Subjects wore earplugs throughout the experiment to attenuate MRI gradient noise. Structural scans consisted of a T1-weighted anatomical (TR/TE = 2.73/3.19 ms, ﬂip angle = 7°, FOV=256×256 mm; slice thickness=1.33 mm) and a multi-echo ﬁeldmap scan (f.a.=55°, TR/TE1/TE2=500/3.38/5.84 ms). Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional imaging was performed using a gradient echo T2⁎-weighted pulse sequence (TR/ TE=3000/30 ms, ﬂip angle=90°, FOV=200× 200 mm, 48 coronal slices, slice thickness = 3.0 mm with 0.6 mm interslice gap, matrix=64×64, 110 time points for a total of 5.5 min). Image collection was preceded by 5 dummy scans. Coronal slices were used to minimize susceptibility artifact (gradient distortion) in subcortical limbic regions (Ojemann et al., 1997).  Data analysis was performed using a combination of analysis packages including FSL (FMRIB's Software Library) and AFNI. Functional data were pre-processed to correct for magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneities caused by magnetic susceptibility differences in neighboring tissues within the head (FSLFUGUE) and motion corrected to compensate for any head movements using a linear (afﬁne) transformation procedure (FSL-FLIRT). Brain extraction was performed on functional data using FSL-BET while skull stripping of structural data for alignment utilized Freesurfer software. Functional data were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 5 mm; and high-pass temporal ﬁltering (f =1/330 Hz) was also performed.  Single-subject fMRI and structural data analysis  Statistical parametric mapping at the single subject level was completed via a generalized linear model (GLM) by using FMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT, FSL). The explanatory variable utilized in the general linear model (GLM) analysis was deﬁned by the on-line  1058  V. Napadow et al. / NeuroImage 47 (2009) 1055–1065  sensation rating time series convolved with a canonical gamma function (SD= 3 s, mean lag=6 s). The on-line rating sensation was re-scaled to fall within the range of 0 to 1 (from the initial rating of 0 to 100). For comparison, we performed a separate, more traditional GLM analysis using the block design as explanatory variable. As our difference map results (see below) did not contain signiﬁcant subcortical response, the resulting parameter estimates associated with both analyses were used in both a volumetric and surface-based group analysis, which provides better ﬁdelity for cortical response.  In order to perform a surface-based group analysis, structural T1weighted MPRAGE images from each subject were processed by the Freesurfer software package, which was used to generate a model of the cortical surface through intensity normalization, skull stripping, segmentation, and tessellation of the gray/white matter interface surface (Dale et al., 1999). This reconstructed cortical surface was inﬂated using spring force and metric-preserving terms. The tessellated surface was also projected onto a unit sphere (spherical space), using algorithms that minimize metric distortions, thereby parameterizing the surface into a spherical-based coordinate system (Fischl et al., 1999).  Group fMRI data analysis  Surface-based group analysis was completed using the Freesurfer software package. The cortical surface of each subject brain was normalized to an average brain template by maximizing alignment of the folding patterns in a spherical representation, a process that provides accurate group-averaged statistical analysis over surface elements from topologically homologous regions in the brains of different subjects. Parameter estimates and their variance from each subject were mapped to surface space with a 0.5 projection fraction  (half the distance between gray/white boundary and pial surface). Group maps for both ACUP and SHAM were generated with a onesample t-test under mixed effects estimation (weighted least squares). A Difference map contrasting ACUP and SHAM was also created under a mixed effects model using a paired t-test. As sensation intensity was found to be signiﬁcantly greater for ACUP compared to SHAM (see Results), the mixed effects model controlled for the mean sensation intensity calculated across the entire time series, using a covariate of no-interest. This difference map helps control for brain activity associated with cutaneous stimulation, placebo effects, and with performing a motor/rating task, as this task was performed for both ACUP and SHAM, and would be subtracted off in the difference map. Resultant statistical parametric maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using a Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations) combining node-wise and cluster-wise probability thresholding. Signiﬁcant clusters were retained with cluster-wise probability threshold of 0.05.  The volumetric group analysis for subcortical regions was performed by transforming subject level parameter estimates and their variance into MNI space, and performing single-sample and paired t-tests using a mixed effects model (FLAME, FSL). The results were corrected for multiple comparisons using Gaussian Random Field theory. Signiﬁcant clusters were retained with cluster-wise probability threshold of 0.05.  Results  All 15 subjects were able to complete both stimulation runs, however one subject was excluded from further fMRI GLM analysis because their on-line rating for SHAM was near zero (2.8+1.9, μ±σ, on a scale of 0–100).  Fig. 2. (A) In a single subject, SHAM induced on-line sensation that followed the stimulation paradigm more closely than for ACUP, where sensation was even noted to peak during a rest block.

Psychophysics results  Both on-line rating and retrospective psychophysical data were collected. While notable inter-subject variability existed, particularly for ACUP (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2), on-line acupuncture sensation timeseries demonstrated different patterns between ACUP and SHAM stimulation runs (Fig. 2). The SHAM (Spearman's r= 0.63) rating time series correlated better with the stimulation block design (p b0.001) compared to ACUP (r =0.32, Fig. 2-B). Furthermore, while SHAM showed greater power (p b0.05) within the stimulation frequency band, ACUP showed greater power (p b0.05) within the low frequency band (Fig. 3). This result was partly due to increased sensation persistence into the no-stimulation rest block following the stimulation block for ACUP compared to SHAM (Fig. 2–C). However, some subjects had more unusual patterns of sensation response — occasionally with even more sensation during no-stimulation blocks than during stimulation blocks (Fig. 2–A, Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). As a result, subjects spent more of the ACUP scan run rating low (10–40, p b0.005) and moderate (40–70, p b0.05) sensations, than during SHAM (Fig. 4). In contrast, during SHAM, subjects spent signiﬁcantly more time (p b0.001) rating minimal or no sensation (0–10),  Fig. 4. Cognitive load was inferred from the amount of time subjects spent rating different sensation intensities. For ACUP, subjects spent more of the scan run (330 s total) rating both low (10–40) and moderate (40–70) sensations than for SHAM. In turn, subjects experiencing SHAM spent more time rating minimal to no sensation (0–10). No difference was found for strong sensations. n.b. error bars represent standard deviation. ⁎⁎⁎p b 0.001, ⁎⁎p b 0.005, ⁎p b 0.05.  compared to ACUP. There was no difference in the time spent rating strong sensations (p N0.1).  Retrospective sensation ratings using the MASS scale were also collected and revealed different qualities and intensity of sensation (Fig. 5). The MASS Index, a measure of overall sensation intensity, was greater for ACUP compared to SHAM stimulation (paired t-test, p b0.01). Interestingly, our on-line data corroborated this result, as average on-line rating intensity was greater (p b0.05) for ACUP (29.2±11.3) than for SHAM (20.7±14.0). Additionally, MASS Index was correlated with average on-line rating intensity (ACUP: r =0.79, p b0.001; SHAM: r=0.74, p b0.005). Speciﬁc MASS sensations were also different, in intensity (0–10 scale) and prevalence, between the two stimulation runs. ACUP demonstrated greater intensity than SHAM for the following sensations: soreness (ACUP: 2.7±2.6, μ±σ; SHAM: 1.3±1.8; p b0.05), aching (ACUP: 3.8±2.5; SHAM: 1.3 ±1.8; p b0.005), Fullness (ACUP: 1.5±2.1; SHAM: 0.3±0.5; p b0.05), dull pain (ACUP: 4.2±1.9; SHAM: 1.3±1.8; p b0.001), and spreading (ACUP: 2.2±2.6; SHAM: 0.6±1.0; p b0.05). Interestingly, SHAM (−1.2±2.4) was associated with greater (p b0.05) relaxation compared to ACUP (0.2 ± 2.3). However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the intensity of sharp pain (ACUP: 3.5±2.7; SHAM: 4.0±3.1) or throbbing (ACUP: 2.4±2.5; SHAM: 1.2 ±2.1), sensations which have not been associated with deqi (Hui et al., 2007). In regard to sensation prevalence, an omnibus test (Fisher's combined probability test) found that ACUP and SHAM also differed in the types of sensations elicited (p b0.001). The prevalence of “aching” (ACUP: 86.7% of subjects, SHAM: 40.0%, p b0.01), “fullness” (ACUP: 46.7%, SHAM: 13.3%, p b0.05), and “dull pain” (ACUP: 93.3%, SHAM: 40.0%, p b0.005) was found to be greater for ACUP. It should also be noted that while sharp pain was reported for both ACUP and SHAM, when debriefed, most subjects who reported sharp pain described this sensation as only transient, occurring typically at the start of stimulation.  fMRI results  Group maps of the main effect for percept-related fMRI demonstrated many similarities between ACUP and SHAM (Figs. 6, 7, Tables 1, 2). The sensation elicited by both stimulations was associated with activation in areas implicated in sensorimotor processing: bilateral SI, SII, posterior parietal (angular (angG) and supramarginal (SMG) gyri), anterior and posterior insula, supplementary motor area (SMA), and precentral gyrus (more left than right hemisphere).

In our data, deactivation was found in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Deactivation outside of the DMN was also found in medial occipital (visual) areas and right central sulcus (BA 3a). Higher cognitive areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, consistent with BA 9, 10, 44, 45, 46), were also modulated (mostly activated) bilaterally by both forms of stimulation. For ACUP, activation was also seen in the dorsomedial  prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). For SHAM, activation was also seen in the caudate, putamen, cerebellum, and regions associated with sensorimotor processing, such as the posterior middle cingulate cortex (pMCC), and lateral occipital complex (LOC). Deactivation in defaultmode regions also included the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and hippocampal formation.  A group difference map contrasting ACUP and SHAM was completed in order to better control for cutaneous tactile, placebo, and motor/rating task effects, as these aspects would play a role for both modes of stimulation. The ACUP-SHAM difference map noted several important differences between ACUP and SHAM (Fig. 8,  Fig. 6. Percept-related fMRI main effect group map for ACUP. Percept-related fMRI using on-line sensation rating yielded activation in sensorimotor processing regions (SII, angG, insula, precentG) and deactivation in default-mode regions (e.g. PCC).

Table 3). Clusters with signiﬁcant positive Z-scores could arise from either greater ACUP activation, or greater SHAM deactivation. The inverse is true for clusters with signiﬁcant negative Z-scores. With this caveat in mind (and dissociated by group %-change for each cluster in Table 3), SHAM induced greater activation in sensorimotor processing regions including bilateral SI (BA 2), SII, and LOC. SHAM sensation was also correlated with greater activation in the left anterior insula. Furthermore, SHAM also induced greater deactivation in defaultmode regions including PCC (both dorsal and ventral), precuneus, vmPFC, IPL, and parahippocampus. Greater deactivation was also induced by SHAM in a medial parietal paracentral region, MTG/STG, and cuneus. However, ACUP induced greater activation in the dlPFC, and both the cognitive/evaluative (posterior) and emotional/interoceptive (anterior) subregions of the dmPFC, as anatomically and functionally parcellated by Amodio and Frith, as well as Steele and Lawrie (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Steele and Lawrie, 2004).  Comparing the above percept-related results to a more traditional analysis using the stimulation block design, some similar trends were noted in that SHAM induced greater activation in sensorimotor processing regions and deactivation in default-mode regions (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, the block-design group map for ACUP also demonstrated deactivation in the vmPFC and sub-genual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), while there was no activation in the dmPFC (which was activated in the percept-related analysis for ACUP). The block-design group map for SHAM was very similar to the perceptrelated analysis, which was not surprising as SHAM ratings were signiﬁcantly more similar to the block design than were ACUP ratings.  Discussion  Our study applied percept-related fMRI to evaluate the neural correlates of an important component of acupuncture therapy — the sensation elicited by needle manipulation. We contrasted real ACUP with a non-insertive SHAM, and found that the sensations elicited by ACUP were qualitatively more complex, persisted after cessation of  1062  V.

Furthermore, while substantial similarities existed in brain response to ACUP and SHAM, notably activation of the sensorimotor system and deactivation of the DMN, important differences were also found. Speciﬁcally, while SHAM sensation was associated with greater activation in sensorimotor-linked areas and greater deactivation in the DMN, ACUP sensation was associated with greater activation in higher cognitive areas: dlPFC and both the emotional/interoceptive (anterior) and cognitive/evaluative (posterior) subregions of the dmPFC. We suggest that this latter ﬁnding may be key to understanding acupuncture sensation processing in the brain, and offers clues to how the induced sensation might lead to therapeutic response.  Somatosensory sensations are a unique characteristic of acupuncture therapy. Many different styles of acupuncture attempt to elicit sensations during treatment, as they are classically thought to be linked with successful therapeutic outcomes (Cheng, 1996). When sensation was used to guide fMRI data analysis, ACUP sensation (and not SHAM) was linked with activation in both the anterior and posterior subregions of the dmPFC. Previous reviews have associated the former with emotional and interoceptive processing, and the latter with evaluative processing needed to translate a perception into  a motor rating (behavioral) response (Amodio and Frith, 2006). While both ACUP and SHAM would require this evaluative processing, we believe that activity for ACUP was more pronounced due to the increased cognitive load required to rate the more complex sensations. This hypothesis is in agreement with indirect measures of cognitive load — i.e. subjects rating ACUP spent more run-time rating low and moderate sensations, and less time rating minimal/nil sensations compared to SHAM. Similarly, Kong et al. (2006b) found that low and moderate pain stimuli are actually more effective than strong pain stimuli in activating the evaluative network. On the other hand, greater ACUP interoceptive processing (and likely emotional and autonomic response (Park et al., 2007)) is attributed to greater anterior dmPFC response. The dmPFC is known to connect to lower level autonomic outﬂow regions such as the PAG (An et al., 1998) and hypothalamus (Ongur et al., 1998) in monkeys, and has been associated with parasympathetic outﬂow in humans (Napadow et al., 2008). Greater emotional and interoceptive processing is likely due to the atypical stimuli coming from deeper, sub-dermal receptors, compared to the more commonly activated cutaneous mechanoreceptors stimulated by SHAM. We suggest that focused bodily attention following acupuncture serves as a therapeutic mechanism for some conditions, similar to other mind-body therapies (e.g. Feldenkreis therapy, t'ai chi ch'uan) that enhance bodily awareness and have been applied for chronic pain conditions known to be linked with psychological dissociation, such as chronic pelvic pain (Haugstad et al., 2006) and ﬁbromyalgia (Gard, 2005). In other words, acupuncture can function as a somatosensory-guided mind–body therapy.  Other potential cognitive mechanisms for acupuncture action also exist, and may have been accentuated by our percept-related fMRI approach, which effectively united a cognitive rating task with a somatosensory perception task. For instance, previous studies have found that rating pain, versus passively experiencing pain, enhances activation in most pain-matrix regions. These would include both dlPFC and dmPFC (Schoedel et al., 2008), and the enhancement is likely due to more focused attention and evaluation of the perceived pain sensation. This effect is consistent with our ﬁndings — i.e. while the sensation was different between ACUP and SHAM, it may be the re-evaluation of this sensation that is even more important. In addition to dmPFC, ACUP also activated dlPFC to a greater extent than SHAM. Interestingly, this region is modulated by different forms of placebo analgesia (Kong et al., 2006a; Petrovic and Ingvar, 2002; Wager et al., 2004). One aspect of acupuncture analgesia likely involves cognitive mechanisms which may also be present in placebo interventions, and acupuncture sensation may serve to enhance this particular aspect. It should be noted that acupuncture sensation rating served to focus attention on the stimulus, leading to enhanced activation in sensorimotor as well as higher brain regions, as compared to that noted in past non-rating studies from our group (Dhond et al., 2007; Hui et al., 2005; Napadow et al., 2005). Importantly, cognition is known to strongly inﬂuence pain (for review see Villemure and Bushnell (2002)). For instance, focused attention on pain up-regulates, while distraction down-regulates pain perception (Arntz et al., 1991). In fact, an fMRI study found that distraction leads to decreased activity in most pain-matrix regions, a phenomenon attributed to increased activation of anterior dmPFC, pgACC, and periaqueductal gray brain regions (Valet et al., 2004). Another potential mechanism for acupuncture analgesia could then involve distraction from ongoing nociceptive afference. In many styles of acupuncture, the acupuncturist commonly asks the patient whether or not needle manipulation was perceived, what the sensation felt like, etc. While such feedback is used by the acupuncturist to adjust their needle manipulation, it also draws the patient's awareness to the needle site, piquing their attention. Furthermore, many acupuncture styles use acupoint locations far away from the pain source and, at least for some localized chronic pain conditions, acupuncture  V.

Using on-line sensation rating, SHAM induced greater activation in sensorimotor processing regions (SI, SII, insula, LOC) and greater deactivation in default-mode regions (e.g. PCC, vmPFC, parahipp). However, ACUP induced greater activation in cognitive-evaluative (posterior dmPFC, dlPFC) and emotional-interoceptive (anterior dmPFC) cortical brain regions. n.b.

Many recent clinical trials of acupuncture for chronic pain conditions have reported effectiveness of both real and different forms of sham acupuncture above and beyond a usual care control (Cherkin et al., 2009; Moffet, 2009; Park et al., 2008). Our fMRI results, while demonstrating interesting differences in important brain regions, also demonstrate a noted similarity between ACUP and  SHAM in the brain networks modulated by the stimulus-associated sensation. In other words, whether deep or cutaneous receptors are being stimulated over an acupoint, there is sensorimotor network activation (including insula response), and DMN deactivation. Future studies should evaluate whether acupuncture sensation and activity in these networks, as induced by deep or cutaneous stimulation on or away from classical acupoints, is associated with eventual clinical outcomes. We have suggested that some bodily locations may simply  Table 3 Summary of percept-fMRI difference map (ACUP-SHAM).

However, our study's noted similarities in brain response between ACUP and SHAM (over the same skin location) may help explain the equivalence of real and sham acupuncture in the clinical trials mentioned above, and suggests that somatosensory-based sham controls, particularly over classical acupoints, may not be the most appropriate placebo control for future trials of acupuncture.  While some cognitive mechanisms for acupuncture action were accentuated by percept-related fMRI, our approach also introduced certain implications for the interpretation of results vis-à-vis past acupuncture fMRI studies. Speciﬁcally, compared to our current results, past studies noted not just less sensorimotor activation (as noted above), but also more prominent deactivation in subcortical and limbic brain regions for ACUP stimulation (Hui et al., 2000; Hui et al., 2005; Napadow et al., 2007; Napadow et al., 2005). The paucity of subcortical response to ACUP in our study was surprising. Several possible explanations exist. Firstly, while overlaying a cognitive task (rating) over acupuncture stimulation may have contributed to less pronounced deactivation; we did note qualitatively more prominent deactivation in our data when using the block design as GLM regressor. Hence, deactivations in subcortical regions may be due to subconscious processing during needle stimulation, which may be diminished by top-down inﬂuences from higher cortical regions responsible for evaluating needle sensation. Another possibility is that acupuncture at the acupoint used (PC-6) produces less prominent limbic deactivation — a hypothesis in agreement with the only other published fMRI report of PC-6 stimulation (Yoo et al., 2007), which noted no deactivations. On the other hand, our percept-related fMRI study demonstrated persistence of ACUP sensation into the nostimulation rest block following needle manipulation. This persistence, if present for other acupoints as well, could have affected past block-design fMRI analyses noting subcortical deactivation, as there might have been a mismatch between stimulation and afference (and sensation). This factor may also contribute to the noted inter-subject variability in fMRI response and heterogeneity of past studies (Dhond et al., 2007; Kong et al., 2007b).  We also found that SHAM sensation was associated with more prominent activation of sensorimotor brain regions (SI, SII, LOC) compared to ACUP. However, ACUP elicited stronger sensation intensity (by both average rating intensity and retrospective MASS Index) compared to SHAM. This paradox can be explained by the fact that during SHAM, subjects spent more run-time rating minimal/nil ratings. In contrast, rating ACUP sensation may be associated with greater cognitive load, as sensation intensity gradually increased throughout the run and subjects spent more run-time rating mild and moderate sensations. Thus, the SHAM sensation was easier to rate, with more discrete transitions between existent and non-existent somatosensory perception — a ﬁnding further substantiated by the signiﬁcantly less power found in lower frequencies of the ratings power spectrum. This sharper transition likely resulted from more certainty in rating and allowed brain activity in sensorimotor areas to return to a “basal state” during rest blocks. This, in turn, resulted in greater dynamic range and more signiﬁcant activation in the sensorimotor system for SHAM. In addition, an interesting (and previously not noted) somatosensory processing region demonstrating activation in SHAM, and not ACUP, was the LOC. This area has been associated with brain processing of both visual and tactile shape recognition (Amedi et al., 2002) — a quality typically evaluated by cutaneous receptors, which were likely more readily activated by SHAM. Other activated somatosensory areas included SI and SII. These regions have been noted in past studies to be more prominently activated for tactile stimulation compared to real acupuncture (Hui et al., 2000). We also found greater SHAM activation in the STG, a  multimodal sensory area receiving input from the posterior insula (Hackett et al., 2007), which was also activated in this study. Furthermore, the pMCC, which was activated in SHAM, interacts with postero-lateral parietal regions in orienting the body in response to somatosensory stimuli (Vogt, 2005).  A similar explanation as above (for sensorimotor regions) likely also holds for greater DMN deactivation for SHAM. Speciﬁcally, greater cognitive load spread throughout the ACUP scan run and less distinct transitions between existent and non-existent sensation likely led to less pronounced deactivation of DMN brain regions such as the PCC, vmPFC, and parahippocampus. In other words, there was signiﬁcantly less time during ACUP runs when focus on an external stimulus could be switched off in preference for internal mentation, unfocused external monitoring, or any other functions attributed to the DMN (Buckner et al., 2008). However, it should also be mentioned that ACUP has been found to enhance resting connectivity in the DMN following the cessation of needle stimulation (Dhond et al., 2008), and future studies should attempt to link this lasting inﬂuence on the DMN with brain response to active stimulation.  Several limitations to our approach should be discussed. Firstly, in addition to the overlay of a cognitive task on top of a somatosensory task, percept-related fMRI is also associated with a motor task — i.e. the right-handed rating of sensation using our MR-compatible potentiometer device. Hence, some of our fMRI results may have been inﬂuenced by brain networks needed to execute this motor task. Particularly, activation in contralateral M1 and SI (left precentral and postcentral gyri) and deactivation in ipsilateral SI (right BA 3a) for both ACUP and SHAM (though greater in SHAM) was likely due to the execution of the motor aspect of sensation rating. Similarly, brain response in the cuneus and other visual areas of the medial occipital lobe are likely due to the visual feedback inherent to the rating task. These limitations have been noted in the past, and our analysis used a control condition (SHAM) to attempt to subtract off or minimize the motor/rating and visual aspects of the task. Furthermore, we (and others, see Baliki et al., 2006; Davis et al., 2002) believe that these disadvantages are outweighed by the advantages of collecting, analyzing, and using on-line ratings to guide fMRI data analysis, which uniquely allows for the direct inference of the neural correlates of sensation.  In conclusion, percept-related fMRI demonstrated that sensations elicited in real ACUP are qualitatively more complex, more persistent, and vary more appreciably between individuals, compared to SHAM. Furthermore, while both ACUP and SHAM elicited sensation associated with activation of the sensorimotor system and deactivation of the DMN, important differences were also found. SHAM sensation was associated with greater activation in the sensorimotor system and greater deactivation in the DMN compared to ACUP, a consequence of more distinct transitions between existent and non-existent sensation. However, an increased cognitive load for subjects rating ACUP sensations led to greater activation in the dlPFC, and both the emotional/interoceptive (anterior) and cognitive/evaluative (posterior) subregions of the dmPFC. This latter ﬁnding may be a salient component of acupuncture analgesia — sensations focus attention and accentuate bodily awareness, contributing to enhanced top-down modulation of nociceptive afference and central pain networks.

Introduction  Affective   mentalizing   involves   the   integration   of  various   social   signals   in   order   to  infer   the   affective states   of   others.   Previous   neuroimaging   studies   have   shown   that   the   medial   prefrontal   cortex,   the precuneus/posterior   cingulate   cortex,   and   the   temporo-parietal   junction   constitute   the  core   affective mentalizing   network.   However,   the   relative   contributions   of   these   regions   to  affective   mentalizing   remain unclear.   We   used   functional   magnetic   resonance   imaging   to  investigate   which   of  these   nodes   are   involved in   the   integration   of   two   social   signals:   emotional   tears   and   facial   expressions.   We   assumed   that   this   integration   would   produce   a  supra-additive   effect,   indicated   by   greater   activity   than   the  sum   of   the   effects   of the   individual   social   signals.   Female   subjects   rated   the   sadness   of  faces   with   either   tears   or   tear-like   circles,   and   either   sad   or   neutral   expressions.   We   observed   the   supra-additive   effect   in   the   medial   prefrontal cortex   and  precuneus/posterior   cingulate   cortex   but   not   in   the   temporo-parietal   junction.   These   results indicate   that   the   medial   prefrontal   cortex   and   precuneus/posterior   cingulate   cortex   play   an   important role   in   integrating   tears   and   facial   expressions   during   affective   mentalizing.  ©   2015  The   Authors.

Social  cognition  involves  psychological  processes  that  allow humans  to  make  inferences  about  other  people.  Among  such  processes,  affective  mentalizing  (or  cognitive  empathy)  is  deﬁned  as the  process  of  inferring  another’s  affective  state  (i.e.,  “I  understand  how  you  feel”)  (Perry  and  Shamay-Tsoory,  2013).  Previous neuroimaging  and  lesion  studies  have  identiﬁed  a  number  of brain  regions  involved  in  affective  mentalizing  (Frith  and  Frith, 2003;  Samson  et  al.,  2004;  Saxe  and  Powell,  2006;  Mitchell, 2008;  Shamay-Tsoory  et  al.,  2009;  Atique  et  al.,  2011;  CorradiDell’Acqua  et  al.,  2014).  Among  these  regions,  the  medial  prefrontal cortex  (mPFC),  the  precuneus/posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC), and  the  temporo-parietal  junction  (TPJ)  are  considered  the  core  ∗ Corresponding  authors  at:  Division  of  Cerebral  Integration,  National  Institute   for  Physiological  Sciences,  Okazaki  444-8585,  Japan.

However,  the relative  contributions  of  these  nodes  to  affective  mentalizing  are not  well  understood.  One  possible  way  to  clarify  the  relative  contributions  of  these nodes  is  to  examine  the  brain  regions  that  are  involved  in  integrating  multiple  social  signals  to  infer  another’s  affective  state.  Here, we  deﬁne  the  integration  as  a  process  in  which  social  signals  are combined  to  infer  the  most  likely  affective  state.  In  the  ﬁeld  of multisensory  research,  if  two  different  types  of  social  signal  are integrated  in  a  region,  it  is  expected  not  only  to  be  activated  by each  separately  (convergence),  but  also  to  show  interaction  effects between  them  (Calvert  et  al.,  2000;  Raij  et  al.,  2000;  Stevenson  et  al., 2009).  Previous  neuroimaging  studies  have  consistently  found  that the  mPFC  contains  information  about  another’s  emotional  state, regardless  of  whether  the  social  signals  involved  facial,  body,  or vocal  expressions  (Peelen  et  al.,  2010),  or  whether  they  involved facial  expressions  or  situational  information  in  the  absence  of  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neures.2015.07.005 0168-0102/©  2015  The  Authors.

Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43   33  observable  expressions  (Skerry  and  Saxe,  2014).  These  ﬁndings indicate  that  the  mPFC  plays  a  key  role  in  representing  others’ affective  states  at  the  abstract  level  by  receiving  information  about distinct  social  signals.  However,  each  type  of  social  signal  was   presented  separately  in  previous  studies,  so  it  has  remained  unclear whether  the  mPFC  is  involved  in  the  integration  process.  Even  less  is  known  about  the  role  of  the  PCC  and  TPJ  in  the integration  of  social  signals.  In  particular,  the  function  of  the  PCC in  mentalizing  is  not  well  understood;  hence,  little  attention  has been  paid  to  its  role  in  integrating  social  signals.  Furthermore,  the function  of  the  TPJ  in  mentalizing  has  been  controversial  (Decety and  Lamm,   2007;  Mitchell,  2008;  Scholz  et  al.,  2009;  Cabeza  et  al., 2012),  and  its  role  in  the  integration  of  social  signals  has  not been  clariﬁed.  For  instance,  Peelen  et  al.  (2010)  showed  that  a region  adjacent  to  the  TPJ  also  contains  information  about  another’s emotional  state  across  different  types  of  emotional  expression (face,  body,  and  voice).  However,  a  subsequent  neuroimaging  study by  Skerry  and  Saxe  (2014)  utilizing  facial  expressions  and  situational  information  (e.g.,  social  exclusion)  showed  that  the  TPJ did  not  represent  another’s  emotional  state  at  an  abstract  level; more  speciﬁcally,  their  work  showed  that  a  classiﬁer,  which  was trained  to  discriminate  the  valence  of  one  social  signal  within the  TPJ,  did  not  successfully  classify  that  valence  for  the  other social  signals.  Understanding  another  person’s  affective  state  based on  situational  information  is  critically  different  from  interpreting emotional  expressions  (produced  by  the  face,  body,  and  voice),  in that  situational  information  can  be  interpreted  in  multiple  ways and  presents  an  ill-posed  inverse  problem  (e.g.,  a  person  might feel  happy  or  sad  when  he  or  she  is  separated  from  others).  Thus, understanding  situational  information  in  a  socially-appropriate manner  requires  knowledge  of  the  social  event  (e.g.,  that  separation  from  others  should  be  considered  a  sad  event;  Barbey  et  al., 2009;  Krueger  et  al.,  2009).  Thus,  we  anticipate  that  the  TPJ  plays a  minor  role  in  the  integration  of  social  signals  that  involve  social event  knowledge.  Given  this  background,  we  focused  our  investigation  on  the  integration  of  two  social  signals  from  facial  stimuli:  tears  and  facial expressions.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  neither  the  neural  mechanisms  underlying  the  processing  of  tears  as  social  stimuli  nor  the neural  bases  of  the  integration  of  tears  and  facial  expressions  has been  identiﬁed.  Emotional  tears  appear  to  be  unique  to  humans  and are  of  considerable  interest  in  the  ﬁeld  of  evolutionary  psychology (e.g.,  Murube  et  al.,  1999;  Provine  et  al.,  2009;  Balsters  et  al.,  2013). Like  social  situations,  understanding  another’s  affective  state  from tears  is  an  ill-posed  inverse  problem,  because  tears  can  be  shed  in response  to  many  different  emotions  (e.g.,  anger,  happiness,  and sadness;  Murube  et  al.,  1999).  Therefore,  tears  are  similar  to  social situations  in  that  they  require  social  event  knowledge  in  order  to achieve  the  most  appropriate  interpretation.  In  the  absence  of  contextual  information,  humans  tend  to  interpret  tears  as  a  symbol  of sadness  (i.e.,  the  tears  effect;  Provine  et  al.,  2009),  possibly  because such  an  interpretation  is  the  most  socially  appropriate.  As  the  mPFC can  represent  others’  emotions  at  an  abstract  level  across  different  social  signals  (Peelen  et  al.,  2010;  Skerry  and  Saxe,  2014),  we predicted  that  it  would  be  involved  in  integrating  tears  and  facial expressions.  The  present  study  used  functional  magnetic-resonance  imaging (fMRI)  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  the  mPFC,  but  not  the  TPJ,  integrates  tears  and  facial  expressions  during  the  evaluation  of  others’ sadness.  We   also  explored  the  role  of  the  PCC  in  this  integration process  without  a  speciﬁc  hypothesis.  We   manipulated  two  factors:  tears  (tears,  tear-like  control  objects,  and  no  object)  and  facial expressions  (sad  and  neutral).  We   initially  tested  our  assumption that  the  core  mentalizing  network  is  activated  by  the  presence  of tears,  and  then  examined  whether  this  network  shows  interaction effects  between  tears  and  facial  expressions.  We   predicted  that  the  mPFC  would  show  a  supra-additive  effect,  providing  evidence of  the  integration  of  information  on  tears  and  facial  expressions (Meredith  and  Stein,  1983;  Calvert  et  al.,  2000;  Raij  et  al.,  2000; Stevenson  et  al.,  2009).  In  other  words,  these  regions  should  show stronger  activation  in  response  to  a  sad  facial  expression  with  tears than  the  sum  of  the  activity  in  response  to  individual  presentations of  a  sad  facial  expression  without  tears  and  a  neutral  facial  expression  with  tears.  By  contrast,  we   predicted  that  the  TPJ  would  not show  the  same  effect.  2.  Materials  and  methods  2.1.  Subjects  Sixty-one  healthy  subjects  aged  18–44  years  (mean  age  =  22.1 years;  standard  deviation  [SD]  =  4.7  years)  participated  in  the  study. We  recruited  only  female  participants  because  they  tend  to  react to  crying  people  with  more  sympathy  and  support  than  males (Cretser  et  al.,  1982).  All  subjects  were  right-handed  according  to the  Edinburgh  Handedness  Inventory  (Oldﬁeld,  1971).  None  of  the volunteers  had  a  history  of  symptoms  requiring  neurological,  psychological,  or  other  medical  care.  All  subjects  gave  written  informed consent.  The  study  was  approved  by  the  ethical  committee  of  the National  Institute  for  Physiological  Sciences  of  Japan.  Thirty-eight subjects  participated  in  the  main  fMRI  experiment.  The  rest  of  the subjects  (n  =  23)  participated  in  a  separate  experiment  to  deﬁne  the regions  of  interest  (ROIs).  None  of  the  subjects  participated  in  both experiments.  2.2.  Data  acquisition  fMR   images  were  acquired  using  a  3T  scanner  (Verio;  Siemens Erlangen,  Germany)  with  a  32-element  phased-array  head  coil. Tight  but  comfortable  foam  padding  was  placed  around  each  subject’s  head  to  minimize  movement.  T2*-weighted  gradient-echo echo-planar  imaging  (EPI)  was   used  to  obtain  the  functional  images. The  sequence  parameters  were  as  follows:  repetition  time  (TR), 3000  ms;   echo  time  (TE),  30  ms;   ﬂip  angle,  83◦;  39  slices  of  3.0  mm thickness  with  a  17%  slice  gap,  which  covered  the  entire  cerebral and  cerebellar  cortices;  ﬁeld  of  view,  192  mm;   and  in-plane  resolu× tion,  3.0  mm    3.0  mm.   Oblique  scanning  was  used  to  exclude  the eyeballs  from  the  images.  For  anatomical  imaging,  a  T1-weighted three-dimensional  (3D)  magnetization-prepared  rapid-acquisition gradient  echo  (MP-RAGE)  sequence  was   obtained  (TR  =  1800  ms; TE  =  2.97  ms;   ﬂip  angle  =  9◦;  ﬁeld  of  view  =  250  mm;   and  voxel dimensions  =  0.9  mm   ×   1.0  mm).  ×   0.9  mm   2.3.  Stimuli  We  used  six  types  of  face:  those  portraying  sad  facial  expressions with  tears,  with  tear-like  circles,  and  without  tears;  and  those  portraying  neutral  facial  expressions  with  tears,  with  tear-like  circles, and  without  tears  (Fig.  1A).  Stimuli  were  produced  as  described below.  2.3.1.  Stimuli  production  We   followed  the  same  procedure  as  Provine  et  al.  (2009)  to produce  the  stimuli.  We   initially  obtained  90  images  of  faces  with tears  (Tears  images)  from  the  online  image  archives  Flickr  (www. ﬂickr.com)  and  Google  (www.google.co.jp).  We   limited  our  search to  images  of  female  adults  in  order  to  eliminate  gender  differences between  the  subjects  and  stimuli.  In  addition  to  facial  images,  we also  collected  45  landscape  images  from  Flickr  to  use  as  controls.  We   removed  the  tears  from  the  90  face  images  using  photoediting  software  (Adobe  Photoshop,  Adobe  Systems  Inc.,  San  Jose, CA)  and  deﬁned  them  as  NoTears  images.  We   then  produced  new  34   H.K.  Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43  Fig.  1.  Experimental  design.  (A)  Task  designs.  We  adopted  a  within-subjects  factorial  design  with  two  factors:  Tears  and  Facial  expression.  We  extended  the  task  design  of Provine  et  al.  (2009)  by  including  two  levels  of  facial  expressions  (Sad  and  Neutral)  and  three  levels  of  Tears  (Tears,  Circles,  and  NoTears).  Note  that  due  to  copyright  issues these   are  schematics  rather  than  the  actual  stimuli.  (B)  Task  schedule.  We   used  conventional  block  designs  in  which  three  trials  of  the  same  condition  (with  different  pictures) were   repeated  three  times  in  a  block  (18  s).  The  order  of  conditions  was   pseudo-randomized.  In  each  trial  (6  s),  the  subject  viewed  the  face  picture  for  3.5  s  and  evaluated  the extent  of  sadness  of  the  person  for  2.5  s.  images  by  adding  gray  circles  to  the  NoTears  images,  resulting  in  the Circles  images.  The  location  and  the  number  of  gray  circles  in  the Circles  images  were  matched  with  the  location  and  number  of  tears in  the  original  (Tears)  images.  We   did  not  include  natural  objects on  stimuli  (e.g.,  scars  or  saliva)  in  order  to  match  the  locations  of stimuli  and  to  avoid  any  possible  interpretation  of  affective  states (e.g.,  the  observed  person  is  hungry  because  of  saliva  on  the  face). Collectively,  we  created  three  sets  of  facial  images  (comprising  270 images  in  total):  90  Tears  images,  90  NoTears  images,  and  90  Circles images.  The  mean  differences  in  size  and  perceived  brightness  of the  images  for  each  condition  were  minimized  using  photo-editing software  (Adobe  Photoshop,  Adobe  Systems  Inc.,  San  Jose,  CA).  We  further  categorized  each  set  of  images  into  two   subsets (sad  and  neutral)  based  on  their  facial  expressions.  Eight  females, who  did  not  participate  in  the  fMRI  experiment,  rated  the  intensity of  sadness  in  the  images  on  a  visual  analog  scale  (VAS)  ranging  from  0  (“not  sad  at  all”)  to  100  (“extremely  sad”).  Initially,  we used  the  VAS  scores  from  the  same  eight  subjects  to  classify  the 90  NoTears  images  into  45  images  of  “sad”  expressions  and  45 images  of  “neutral”  expressions.  Then,  the  Tears  and  Circles  images were  categorized  into  “sad”  and  “neutral”  images;  the  images  for each  facial  expression  were  identical  except  for  the  presence  of tears  or  circles.  In  total,  we  produced  seven  types  of  image:  sad facial  expressions  with  tears  (Sad  Expression  +  Tears  [ST]  images), sad  facial  expressions  without  tears  (Sad  Expression  [S]  images), sad  facial  expressions  with  circles  (Sad  Expression  +  Circles  [SC] images),  neutral  facial  expressions  with  tears  (Neutral  +  Tears  [NT] images),  neutral  faces  without  tears  (Neutral  [N]  images),  neutral faces  with  circles  (Neutral  +  Circles  [NC]  images),  and  landscape images  (Baseline  [B]  images)  (Fig.  1A).  Fig.  1  shows  schematic  drawings  of  representative  stimuli  due  to  copyright  issues.  Each  image was  used  only  once  in  each  experiment.  H.K.  Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43   35  2.3.2.  Stimulus  presentation  Stimuli  were  back-projected  via  a  liquid  crystal  display  (LCD) projector  (CP-SX12000;  Hitachi,  Ltd.,  Tokyo)  onto  a  translucent screen  located  at  the  rear  of  the  scanner.  The  horizontal  and  vertical  viewing  angles  of  stimuli  were  5.3◦ and  7.4◦,  respectively.  The subjects  viewed  stimuli  via  a  mirror  placed  above  the  head  coil.  We used  Presentation  software  to  display  visual  stimuli  and  record  the subject’s  response  (Neurobehavioral  Systems,  Inc.,  San  Francisco, CA).  2.4.  Task  design  and  procedure  A  two-factor  within-subjects  factorial  design  was  used,  with  two levels  of  Facial  Expressions  (Sad  and  Neutral)  and  three  levels  of Tears  (Tears,  NoTears  and  Circles)  (Fig.  1A).  In  addition  to  these six  conditions,  we  included  a  baseline  (B)  condition,  during  which subjects  observed  landscape  images.  We   employed  a  conventional  block  design  (Fig.  1B)  with  ﬁve runs.  Each  run  consisted  of  the  ﬁrst  12  scan  volumes,  followed  by 23  blocks  that  lasted  for  18  s  (6  volumes  per  block),  and  the  ﬁnal × 6  volumes  (12  volumes  +  [23  blocks    6  volumes]  +  6  volumes  =  156 volumes  per  run).  Each  block  included  one  of  the  seven  task  conditions,  and  each  condition  was  repeated  three  times  (21  blocks). Each  block  included  three  trials  of  the  same  condition,  and  each × trial  lasted  6  s  (3  blocks    5  runs  =  45  trials  for each  condition  in  total).  The  order  of  the  conditions  was  pseudorandomized  in  each  repetition.  In  addition,  we  included  two  blocks of  the  rest  condition:  one  between  the  last  block  of  the  ﬁrst  repetition  of  a  condition  and  the  ﬁrst  block  of  the  second  repetition;  and the  other  between  the  last  block  of  the  second  repetition  and  the ﬁrst  block  of  the  third  repetition  (2  rest  blocks  +  21  task  blocks  =  23 blocks  in  total).  ×   3  trials  per  block   In  each  trial,  an  image  was  presented  for  3.5  s,  followed  by  the presentation  of  a  visual  analog  scale  (VAS)  for  2.5  s.  The  subjects used  the  VAS  to  evaluate  the  extent  of  sadness  of  the  presented facial  stimuli.  The  subjects  manipulated  a  two-button  response × box  (HHSC-2    2,  Current  Designs,  Inc.,  Philadelphia,  PA)  with  their right  hand  to  specify  the  location  of  the  vertical  line  on  a  VAS  (the index  ﬁnger  moved  the  line  to  the  left,  and  the  middle  ﬁnger  moved the  line  to  the  right).  The  VAS  scale  consisted  of  a  white-colored horizontal  bar  with  each  end  indicating  the  minimum  (i.e.,  not  sad at  all)  and  the  maximum  (i.e.,  extremely  sad)  of  the  intensity  of sadness  expressed  by  the  image.  The  end  of  the  minimum  and  maximum  was  counterbalanced  across  the  subjects.  In  the  baseline  (B) condition,  the  subject  was  asked  to  move  the  VAS  to  any  position they  wished.  All  of  the  subjects  performed  several  practice  trials in  order  to  familiarize  them  with  the  task  and  to  ensure  they  were able  to  utilize  the  VAS  easily.  2.5.  Imaging  data  processing  The  ﬁrst  six  volumes  of  each  fMRI  run  were  discarded  for  stabilization  of  the  magnetization,  and  the  remaining  150  volumes  per run  (a  total  of  750  volumes  per  participant)  were  used  for  analysis.  Image  processing  and  statistical  analyses  were  performed  using the  Statistical  Parametric  Mapping  (SPM8)  package  (Friston  et  al., 2007).  The  images  were  realigned  to  correct  for  head  motion,  then corrected  for  differences  in  slice  timing  within  each  volume.  After the  T1-weighted  anatomical  images  were  segmented  into  different  tissue  classes,  each  subject’s  T1-weighted  anatomical  image was  co-registered  with  the  mean  image  of  all  of  the  EPI  images for  each  subject.  Each  co-registered  T1-weighted  anatomical  image was  normalized  to  the  Montreal  Neurological  Institute  T1  image template  (ICBM  152)  (Evans  et  al.,  1994;  Friston  et  al.,  1995).  The parameters  from  this  normalization  process  were  then  applied  to each  functional  image.  The  spatially  normalized  EPI  images  were  ﬁltered  using  a  Gaussian  kernel  of  8  mm  full  width  at  half  maximum   (FWHM)  in  the  x,  y,  and  z  axes  (ﬁnal  smoothness:  x  =  11.8, y  =  11.9,  and  z  =  11.8  mm).   The  parameters  from  this  normalization process  were  then  applied  to  the  functional  images,  which  were resampled  to  a  ﬁnal  resolution  of  2   ×   2  mm3.  ×   2   2.6.  Statistical  analyses  2.6.1.  Individual  analyses  A  design  matrix  comprising  the  ﬁve  runs  was  prepared  for  each subject.  We   ﬁtted  a  general  linear  model  (GLM)  to  the  fMRI  data for  each  subject  (Friston  et  al.,  1994a;  Worsley  and  Friston,  1995). Neural  activity  during  each  condition  was  modeled  with  box-car functions  convolved  with  the  canonical  hemodynamic-response function.  Each  run  included  seven  task-related  regressors,  one  for each  condition.  The  time  series  for  each  voxel  was  high-pass  ﬁltered  at  1/128  Hz.  Assuming  a  ﬁrst-order  autoregressive  model, the  serial  autocorrelation  was   estimated  from  the  pooled  active voxels  with  the  restricted  maximum  likelihood  (ReML)  procedure, and  was  used  to  whiten  the  data  (Friston  et  al.,  2002).  Motionrelated  artifacts  were  minimized  by  incorporating  six  parameters (three  displacements  and  three  rotations)  from  the  rigid-body realignment  stage  into  each  model.  The  parameter  estimates  for each  condition  in  each  individual  were  compared  using  linear contrasts.  After  conﬁrming  face-related  activation  (e.g.,  activation in  the  fusiform  gyrus)  by  comparing  face  conditions  with  baseline  (B),  we   evaluated  the  following  contrasts  (Table  1):  ﬁrst, − Tears  minus  NoTears,  [(ST  +  NT)    (S  +  N)];  second,  Tears  minus  Cir− cles,  [(ST  +  NT)    (SC  +  NC)];  third,  Sad  minus  Neutral  expressions, − [(ST  +  S  +  SC)    (NT  +  N  +  NC)];  and  fourth,  the  interaction  effects, − − −   SC)].  The  supra  NC)]  and    (NT  [(ST  − − additive  effect  was   tested  by  the  contrast  of  [(ST    NC)]   SC)  (i.e.,  (ST   −   SC)  −   NC)  >  (SC   [(NT  −   NC)).  −   NC)  +  (NT   −   NC)   −   (ST   −   (NT   2.6.2.  Random-effects  group  analysis  In  the  ﬁrst-level  analysis,  we   obtained  images  that  represent  the normalized  task-related  increment  of  the  MR   signal  of  each  subject for  each  predeﬁned  contrast  (i.e.,  contrast  images).  These  contrast images  were  used  for  the  group  analysis.  For  each  predeﬁned  contrast  (Table  1),  a  one-sample  t-test  was  performed  for  every  voxel in  the  brain  to  obtain  population  inferences  (Holmes  and  Friston, 1998).  The  resulting  set  of  voxel  values  for  each  comparison  constituted  an  SPM  of  the  t  statistic  SPM{t}.  The  height  threshold  for  the SPM{t}   was  set  at  t(37)  >  2.72,  equivalent  to  p  <  0.005  uncorrected. The  statistical  threshold  for  the  spatial  extent  test  on  the  clusters was  set  at  p  <  0.05  and  corrected  for  multiple  comparisons  (familywise  error  [FWE])  over  the  whole  brain  (Friston  et  al.,  1994b,  1996). Brain  regions  were  anatomically  deﬁned  and  labeled  according to  probabilistic  atlases  (Amunts  et  al.,  2005;  Eickhoff  et  al.,  2005; Shattuck  et  al.,  2008)  and  a  previous  meta-analysis  study  (Van Overwalle,  2009).  In  order  to  avoid  the  ambiguity  of  the  anatomical  location  of  the  TPJ,  we   deﬁned  it  as  the  angular  gyrus  (Saxe and  Powell,  2006;  Scholz  et  al.,  2009;  Cabeza  et  al.,  2012).  Consistent  with  a  meta-analysis  (Van  Overwalle,  2009),  we   deﬁned  the mPFC  as  the  medial  wall  of  the  prefrontal  cortex:  that  is,  regions −20  to  20  and  the  y  coorin  which  the  x  coordinates  ranged  from  dinates  were  above  y  >  20  in  MNI   space  (Van  Overwalle,  2009).  We further  subdivided  the  mPFC  into  three  regions  (Van  Overwalle, 2009):  the  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC),  which  lies  above the  z  coordinate  of  20  mm;   the  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex −15  and  z  =  20  mm;   and  the  medial (vmPFC),  which  lies  between  z  =  orbitofrontal  cortex  (mOFC),  which  lies  below  z  =   −15  mm.  2.6.3.  ROI  analysis  After  the  whole-brain  analysis  was   completed,  we   conducted ROI  analysis.  The  assumption  was   that  the  supra-additive  effect  of  36   Table  1 Predeﬁned  contrasts.

Thus,  we  deﬁned  ROIs  based  on  the  brain  regions that  were  activated  by  the  Tears  condition  relative  to  the  NoTears condition.  The  use  of  the  same  dataset  for  the  deﬁnition  of  ROI  and  analysis of  response  patterns  in  the  ROI  can  lead  to  invalid  statistical  inferences  (i.e.,  the  double-dipping  problem;  Kriegeskorte  et  al.,  2009). To  avoid  this,  we  conducted  a  separate  experiment  to  compare  the Tears  condition  with  the  NoTears  condition,  as  described  below.  The  design  and  analyses  of  this  experiment  were  identical  to the  main  experiment  except  that  the  Circles  conditions  (SC  and  NC) × were  removed  (3  blocks  for  each  condition    5  conditions  +  2  rest blocks  =  17  blocks).  We   collected  9  volumes  before  the  ﬁrst  block × and  7  volumes  after  the  last  block  (9  +  [17  blocks    6]  +  7  =  118  volumes  per  run).  The  threshold  for  the  SPM{t}   was  set  at  t(22)  >  2.82 (equivalent  to  p  <  0.005  uncorrected,  which  was  the  same  height threshold  as  that  in  the  main  experiment).  The  statistical  threshold for  the  spatial  extent  test  on  the  clusters  was  set  at  p  <  0.05  and corrected  for  multiple  comparisons  (FWE)  over  the  whole  brain (Friston  et  al.,  1994b,  1996).  We  evaluated  only   the  Tears  minus  NoTears  contrast − [(ST  +  NT)    (S  +  N)].  We   chose  the  peak  coordinates  in  each  cluster in  the  mPFC,  PCC,  and  TPJ.  A  cluster  of  activation  could  include anatomical  regions  beyond  our  hypothesis  (e.g.,  the  fusiform  gyrus in  the  TPJ  ROI).  In  order  to  limit  the  ROIs  to  each  hypothesized region,  we  calculated  the  overlap  between  the  cluster  activated by  the  Tears  effect  and  a  12-mm-radius  sphere  with  the  peak coordinates  of  the  same  cluster.  This  radius  was  identical  to  the effective  resolution  (ﬁnal  smoothness)  of  the  statistical  parametric maps.  This  overlapping  region  in  each  cluster  was  used  as  the  ROI. We  analyzed  the  data  from  the  main  experiment  based  on  these ROIs.  We   used  unsmoothed  data  in  order  to  characterize  activation  patterns  without  blurring  and  to  maximize  the  sensitivity.  We averaged  the  contrast  estimates  in  all  voxels  within  each  ROI  and compared  them  between  the  four  conditions  of  interest  (ST,  SC,  NT, and  NC).  3.  Results  3.1.

Finally,  we   found  that  the  Circles  condition  showed greater  VAS  rating  scores  than  the  NoTears  condition  for  neutral expressions  (p  <  0.01),  but  not  for  sad  facial  expressions  (p  >  0.9).  Taken  together,  these  ﬁndings  conﬁrm  that  the  presence  of  tears  increased  the  sadness  ratings  (Provine  et  al.,  2009).  3.2.   fMRI  results  3.2.1.  Whole-brain  analysis 3.2.1.1.

We   conducted  the  two  contrasts to  evaluate  the  brain  regions  by  the  presence  of  tears:  that  is,  the contrast  with  a  liberal  control  (NoTears)  and  a  stringent  control − (Circles).  The  contrast  of  Tears  minus  NoTears  [(ST  +  NT)    (S  +  N)] revealed  regions  of  signiﬁcant  activation  bilaterally  in  the  vmPFC, mOFC,  posterior  cingulate  gyrus,  TPJ,  superior  parietal  lobule,  superior,  middle  and  inferior  occipital  gyri,  middle  and  inferior  temporal gyri,  fusiform  gyrus,  and  caudate  nucleus  (Fig.  3  and  Table  2).  In addition,  the  same  contrast  revealed  signiﬁcant  activation  in  the  left hemisphere:  speciﬁcally,  in  the  dmPFC,  precuneus,  middle  frontal gyrus,  superior  temporal  gyrus,  amygdala,  hippocampus  and  brainstem.  The  contrast  of  Tears  minus  Circles  [(ST  +  NT)   revealed  no  signiﬁcant  activation.  −   (SC  +  NC)]  levels  of  Facial  Expressions   The  presence  of  tears  on  the  face  images  increased  the  VAS ratings  of  sadness  (Fig.  2).

Post  hoc  pair-wise  comparisons  (with  a Bonferroni  correction)  showed  that  there  were  greater  VAS  ratings in  the  Tears  condition  compared  with  the  NoTears  and  Circles conditions  for  each  facial  expression  (p  values  <  0.001).

By  contrast,  activity  in  the  TPJ  showed  only  the  main effect  of  tears.  In  order  to  further  characterize  response  patterns  in these  regions,  we  conducted  the  following  ROI  analysis.  3.2.2.  ROI  analysis  In  the  whole-brain  analysis,  only  the  main  effect  of  tears  showed activation  in  all  nodes  of  the  core  mentalizing  network  (the  mPFC, PCC,  and  TPJ).  Thus,  we  functionally  deﬁned  ROIs  based  on  this effect.  In  order  to  avoid  the  double-dipping  problem  (Kriegeskorte et  al.,  2009),  we  conducted  a  separate  fMRI  experiment  to  localize  the  mPFC,  PCC,  and  TPJ.  We   found  six  clusters  of  signiﬁcant activation  (Supplementary  Fig.  1  and  Table  1).  Among  these,  the  following  ﬁve  clusters  corresponded  to  the  core  mentalizing  network:  one  cluster  in  the  superior  mPFC  (dmPFC  and  vmPFC);  one cluster  in  the  inferior  mPFC  (mOFC  and  vmPFC);  one  cluster  in  the PCC;  one  cluster  in  the  left  TPJ;  and  one  cluster  in  the  right  TPJ.  We used  these  ﬁve  ROIs  in  the  analyses  (Fig.  6A).  Fig.  6B  shows  the  contrast  estimates  (i.e.,  the  activity  relative to  the  Neutral  NoTears  [N]  condition)  for  the  four  conditions  of interest.  We   conﬁrmed  that  the  contrast  estimates  in  the  ST,  SC, and  NT  conditions  were  signiﬁcantly  greater  than  the  N  condition  in  all  ROIs  except  for  the  SC  condition  in  the  superior  mPFC (p  values  <  0.05,  one-tailed  one-sample  t  tests).  More  speciﬁcally, the  same  statistical  test  showed  a  tendency  toward  signiﬁcance  in the  SC  condition  of  the  superior  mPFC  (t(37)  =  1.6,  p  =  0.06).  The  PCC  and  two   clusters  in  the  mPFC  showed  greater  activity  in the  ST  condition  compared  to  the  other  three  conditions.  Two-way × ANOVAs  (2  levels  of  Tears    2  levels  of  Expressions)  on  the  contrast estimates  of  these  regions  showed  signiﬁcant  main  effects  of  Tears [F(1,  37)  =  8.9,  p  <  0.01  for  the  PCC;  F(1,  37)  =  8.7,  p  <  0.01  for  the inferior  mPFC;  and  F(1,  37)  =  10.3,  p  <  0.01  for  the  superior  mPFC] and  Expressions  [F(1,  37)  =  13.9,  p  <  0.01  for  the  PCC;  F(1,  37)  =  23.9, p  <  0.001  for  the  inferior  mPFC;  and  F(1,  37)  =  8.6,  p  <  0.01  for the  superior  mPFC].

Post  hoc  pairwise  comparisons  (with  a  Bonferroni  correction)  in  these  regions  showed  signiﬁcantly  greater contrast  estimates  in  the  ST  than  the  SC  condition  (p  values  <  0.01), whereas  there  were  no  such  differences  between  the  NT  and  NC conditions  (p  values  >  0.2).  In  contrast  to  the  midline  regions,  we  observed  no  such  differ× ences  in  the  TPJ.  The  same  two-way  ANOVAs  (2  levels  of  Tears  2  levels  of  Expressions)  revealed  neither  signiﬁcant  main  effects (p  values  >  0.06)  nor  interactions  (p  values  >  0.3).  We   conducted a  supplementary  analysis  to  examine  further  whether  the  spatial patterns  of  activation  in  the  TPJ  were  identical  between  tears  and circles  (see  Supplementary  Materials  and  Methods).  We   found that  spatial  patterns  were  more  similar  within  the  tear  condition than  between  the  tear  and  circle  conditions,  suggesting  that activation  patterns  in  the  TPJ  are  not  identical  between  the  two (Supplementary  Fig.  2).  4.  Discussion  In  the  present  study,  the  mPFC  and  PCC  showed  a  supra-additive effect  between  sad  facial  expressions  and  the  presence  of  tears, whereas  the  TPJ  showed  no  such  effect.  4.1.  Behavioral  performance  We  conﬁrmed  the  tears  effect  (Provine  et  al.,  2009)  by  showing that  the  observation  of  tears  increased  ratings  of  sadness  compared with  control  conditions  in  which  there  were  no  tears  (no  tears and  circles  conditions;  Fig.  2).  We   also  found  interaction  effects between  sad  facial  expressions  and  tears:  the  tears  effect  was smaller  for  sad  expressions  than  for  neutral  expressions.  In  other words,  a  signal  of  sadness  shows  a  reduced  effect  when  another indicator  of  sadness  is  already  present.  This  sub-additive  effect might  be  explained  by  Weber’s  law,  which  states  that  the  change  in stimulus  intensity  that  can  be  discriminated  is  a  constant  fraction of  the  intensity  of  the  original  stimulus  (e.g.,  facial  expressions,  Gao et  al.,  2013).  4.2.  Tears  effect  in  the  mPFC,  PCC,  and  TPJ  We  found  that  all  nodes  of  the  core  mentalizing  network  (mPFC, PCC,  and  TPJ)  were  activated  when  rating  the  sadness  of  faces  with tears  compared  to  faces  without  tears  (Figs.  3  and  6B).  To  the  best of  our  knowledge,  only  one  study  has  examined  the  brain  activity of  the  tears  effect.  More  speciﬁcally,  Hendriks  et  al.  (2007)  examined  an  early  event-related  potential  (ERP)  component  (N170)  in response  to  faces  when  the  subject  observed  crying  (with  tears)  40   H.K.

These  regions  were  deﬁned  by  comparing  Tears  minus  NoTears  [(ST  +  SC)    (NT  +  N)]  in  a  separate experiment  (see  Supplementary  Fig.  1  and  Table  1  for  more  information).  (B)  ROI  analysis.  We   averaged  the  contrast  estimates  of  all  voxels  in  each  ROI  and  examined ± their   patterns  across  the  four  conditions  of  interest  (ST,  SC,  NT,  and  NC).  Data  are  presented  as  the  mean    SEM.  Asterisks  above  each  bar  indicate  the  results  of  one-tailed one-sample  t  tests  on  the  contrast  estimate  (relative  to  the  N  condition).  Asterisks  between  bars  indicate  the  statistical  signiﬁcance  of  the  post  hoc  pairwise  comparisons (with   the  Bonferroni  correction).  Two-way  ANOVAs  on  these  contrast  estimates  showed  signiﬁcant  interactions  (the  supra-additive  effect)  in  the  PCC  and  inferior  mPFC (p   values  <  0.05).  The  interaction  term  in  the  superior  mPFC  showed  a  trend  toward  signiﬁcance  (p  =  0.06).  and  other  facial  expressions.  However,  neither  the  latency  nor  the amplitude  of  the  ERPs  differed  between  crying  and  other  facial expressions.  The  present  study  has  identiﬁed  the  neural  substrates underlying  the  tears  effect.  4.3.  Supra-additive  effects  between  tears  and  facial  expressions  in the  mPFC  and  PCC  We   found  that  the  inferior  mPFC  (covering  the  mOFC  and vmPFC)  and  the  PCC  showed  not  only  main  effects  of  facial  expression  and  tears,  but  also  supra-additive  effects  between  them.  As  in  the  ﬁeld  of  multisensory  research,  our  result  indicates that  the  mPFC  and  PCC  are  involved  in  integrating  tears  and  facial expressions  for  the  purpose  of  inferring  others’  sadness.  In  other words,  these  regions  might  be  engaged  in  combining  the  perceived social  signals  to  infer  the  most  likely  extent  of  others’  sadness.  Previous  lesion  studies  showed  that  damage  to  the  orbitofrontal cortex  (OFC),  a  part  of  the  mPFC,  produces  impairments  in  the recognition  of  social  signals  involving  emotional  facial  expressions  (Hornak  et  al.,  1996;  Blair  and  Cipolotti,  2000;  Rolls,  2004; Dal  Monte  et  al.,  2013;  Willis  et  al.,  2014)  and  emotional  vocal expressions  (Hornak  et  al.,  1996,  2003;  Rolls,  2004).  In  accord with  these  ﬁndings,  previous  neuroimaging  studies  have  indicated that  the  mPFC  contains  abstract  representations  of  others’  emotional  states  regardless  of  the  type  of  social  signal  (Peelen  et  al., 2010;  Skerry  and  Saxe,  2014).  However,  as  each  type  of  social signal  was  presented  separately  in  these  studies,  it  was  unclear whether  the  mPFC  showed  an  interaction  effect  between  multiple social  signals.  Moreover,  unlike  the  mPFC,  the  role  of  the  PCC  has been  poorly  investigated  in  the  context  of  mentalizing.  The  current  study  revealed  that  the  mPFC  and  PCC  showed  an  interaction effect  between  distinct  social  signals  during  affective  mentalizing,  H.K.  Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43   41  providing  more  direct  evidence  for  the  integration  of  social  signals in  these  regions.  One  explanation  of  our  result  is  that  the  integration  process  is conducted  in  other  brain  regions,  and  the  supra-additive  effect  in the  mPFC  and  PCC  represents  the  extent  of  others’  sadness  provided  by  such  an  integration  process.  However,  this  interpretation was  not  supported  by  two  ﬁndings:  ﬁrst,  only  the  mPFC  and  PCC consistently  met   the  criteria  of  convergence  (i.e.,  were  activated  by each  social  signal)  and  interaction;  and  second,  the  sadness  rating showed  the  sub-additive  effect,  but  not  the  supra-additive  effect (Fig.  2).  Thus,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  supra-additive  effect  in  these regions  simply  represents  the  extent  of  sadness.  Rather,  it  is  better explained  by  the  hypothesis  that  integrating  two  different  social signals  (for  the  purpose  of  affective  mentalizing)  imposes  greater processing  demands  in  the  mPFC  and  PCC  than  individual  signals. The  core  mentalizing  network  (such  as  the  mPFC  and  PCC)  and the  human  homologue  of  the  mirror-neuron  system  (e.g.,  the  inferior  frontal  gyrus  and  inferior  parietal  lobule)  are  both  active  during the  recognition  of  others’  facial  emotions  (Phan  et  al.,  2002;  Carr et  al.,  2003;  Winston  et  al.,  2003;  Lennox  et  al.,  2004;  Vytal  and Hamann,  2010;  Kitada  et  al.,  2013).  As  compared  to  the  mirrorneuron  system,  the  core  mentalizing  network  seems  to  be  active when  observers  reﬂect  on  the  cause  of  the  behavior  —  e.g.,  why  is this  person  shedding  tears?  (Van  Overwalle  and  Baetens,  2009).  The core  mentalizing  network  is  also  proposed  to  be  a  part  of  the  social “reﬂective  system”  (C  system),  a  slow  system  that  is  responsible  for taking  situational  constraint  information  and  other  prior  knowledge  into  account  for  mentalizing  (Satpute  and  Lieberman,  2006). In  order  to  determine  that  the  person  shedding  tears  is  sad,  we  rely on  knowledge  based  on  previous  experience.  Consistent  with  this view,  the  PCC  is  associated  with  long-term  memory  (Minoshima et  al.,  1997;  Ranganath  et  al.,  2004;  Wagner  et  al.,  2005;  Cavanna and  Trimble,  2006;  Matsuda,  2007).  For  instance,  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD)  is  characterized  not  only  by  medial  temporal  lobe  (MTL) atrophy,  but  also  by  a  reduction  of  glucose  metabolism  in  the cingulo-parietal  cortex,  including  the  precuneus  (Matsuda,  2007). Activity  in  the  precuneus  is  reduced  in  patients  with  very-earlystage  AD  who  exhibit  only  memory  impairment,  without  general cognitive  decline  (Minoshima  et  al.,  1997).  The  default  mode  network  (DMN),  including  the  PCC  and  mPFC,  is  often  associated  with mind  wandering,  which  can  result  in  the  retrieval  of  an  episodic memory  (Mason  et  al.,  2007;  Spreng  et  al.,  2009).  In  the  present study,  the  PCC  showed  activation  not  only  in  the  presence  of  tears, but  also  during  the  observation  of  sad  facial  expressions  (relative to  neutral  expressions;  Figs.  4  and  6B).  Therefore,  the  PCC  might be  involved  in  the  retrieval  of  the  social  meaning  of  tears  (i.e.,  as  a symbol  of  sadness)  from  long-term  memory,  and  the  integration  of the  retrieved  social  knowledge  with  the  sad  facial  expression.  In  addition  to  the  PCC,  we  found  the  supra-additive  effect  in the  inferior  mPFC,  including  the  mOFC  and  vmPFC.  Subregions  in the  mPFC  are  thought  to  play  distinct  but  complementary  roles  in mentalizing  (Amodio  and  Frith,  2006;  Krueger  et  al.,  2009).  Krueger et  al.  (2009)  proposed  that  the  inferior  mPFC  supports  inferences about  the  likely  affective  response  and  reward  value  accompanying  goal  achievement.  According  to  this  hypothesis,  the  process  of integrating  tears  and  facial  expressions  in  this  region  might  reﬂect the  evaluation  of  the  state  of  sadness  (i.e.,  how  sad  is  this  person?).  Lesions  in  the  OFC  can  lead  to  abnormal  social  judgments  in response  to  emotional  faces  (Willis  et  al.,  2010).  More  speciﬁcally, the  subjects  in  this  study  were  presented  with  faces  portraying emotional  expressions  and  asked  to  imagine  whether  they  would approach  them  to  ask  for  directions.  Compared  to  control  (intact) subjects  and  patients  with  damage  to  frontal  regions  sparing  the OFC,  the  patients  with  damage  to  the  OFC  tended  to  have  abnormal   approachability  judgments:  OFC  patients  rated  faces  displaying negative  emotional  expressions  as  signiﬁcantly  more  approachable  than  the  other  subject  groups.  We   also  found  that  the  superior  mPFC showed  a  tendency  toward  the  supra-additive  effect  (Fig.  6B).  The superior  mPFC  is  thought  to  support  inferences  about  the  likely actions  performed  by  others  for  goal  achievement  (i.e.,  why  is  this person  shedding  tears?)  (Krueger  et  al.,  2009).  As  such,  it  is  possible that,  along  with  the  PCC,  these  subregions  in  the  mPFC  might  work in  concert  to  infer  another’s  state  of  sadness  at  an  abstract  level.  We  also  observed  the  supra-additive  effect  in  areas  of  the  limbic system  such  as  the  MTL   and  amygdala  (Table  4).  The  supra-additive effect  in  the  MTL   is  consistent  with  our  speculation  that  the  social knowledge  of  tears  is  retrieved  from  long-term  memory  and  integrated  with  sad  facial  expressions  (Eldridge  et  al.,  2000;  Miyashita, 2004).  The  amygdala  is  considered  as  a  part  of  the  social  “reﬂexive  system”  (X  system),  which  automatically  and  quickly  evaluates others’  behavior  (Satpute  and  Lieberman,  2006).  Thus,  this  reﬂexive  system  (X  system)  might  be  engaged  in  the  integration  of  social signals  directly  (Morris  et  al.,  1998)  or  indirectly  via  the  top-down modulation  from  parts  of  the  reﬂective  system  (C  system),  such as  the  mPFC  and  PCC  (Ochsner  et  al.,  2002;  Pessoa  et  al.,  2002). However,  unlike  the  mPFC  and  PCC,  the  MTL   and  amygdala  were not  consistently  activated  by  the  presence  of  tears  in  the  two experiments;  they  were  not  activated  in  the  separate  experiment (Supplementary  Fig.  1  and  Table  1).  Therefore,  further  studies  are necessary  to  examine  whether  the  MTL   and  amygdala  are  important  for  the  integration  of  tears  and  facial  expressions.  4.4.  No  interaction  effect  in  the  TPJ  Like  the  mPFC  and  PCC,  the  TPJ  showed  greater  activation  when viewing  faces  with  tears  than  without  tears,  which  was  a  more  liberal  control  than  circles  (Figs.  3  and  6A).  However,  we  observed no  interaction  between  facial  expressions  and  tears  (Fig.  6B).  These results  indicate  that  the  TPJ  is  engaged  not  in  the  integration  of signals  related  to  tears  and  facial  expressions,  but  rather  in  the processing  of  tears.  The  TPJ  is  thought  to  be  a  hub  of  diverse  functions,  including perceptual/motor  reorienting  and  theory  of  mind  (Cabeza  et  al., 2012).  It  has  been  proposed  that  one  of  the  general  functions  of  the TPJ  is  to  detect  a  mismatch  between  our  expectations  and  actual outcomes  (Corbetta  et  al.,  2008;  Koster-Hale  and  Saxe,  2013).  More speciﬁcally,  the  TPJ  is  activated  when  a  target  is  presented  in  an unexpected  location  in  spatial  attention  tasks  (Posner  paradigm; Corbetta  and  Shulman,  2002).  False-belief  stories,  which  are  often used  in  mentalizing  tasks,  require  processing  information  detected outside  the  main  focus  of  attention  (Cabeza  et  al.,  2012).  Shedding tears  (in  adults)  and  circles  are  rarely  observed  in  our  daily  life, whereas  the  activation  pattern  between  tears  and  circles  differed  in the  TPJ.  Therefore,  it  is  possible  that  the  TPJ  is  involved  in  detecting and  perceiving  unusual  objects  such  as  tears.  4.5.  Limitations  −   SC)   −   (NT   Two   limitations  must  be  considered.  First,  we  utilized  pictures of  different  individuals  between  the  sad  and  neutral  conditions.  It is  unlikely  that  the  supra-additive  effect  is  also  affected  by  the  difference  in  facial  identity,  because  this  factor  is  subtracted  out  in  the − supra-additive  effect  [(ST    NC)].  However,  we   cannot rule  out  the  possibility  that  greater  activity  in  sad  expressions  (relative  to  neutral  expressions)  can  be  partially  explained  by  different facial  identity.  Second,  we   used  only  female  subjects,  because  they tend  to  react  to  crying  people  with  more  sympathy  and  support than  males  (Cretser  et  al.,  1982).  However,  future  studies  should test  whether  this  ﬁnding  can  be  generalized  to  male  subjects,  and examine  the  integration  of  facial  expressions  and  tears  in  genders that  are  different  from  the  subjects  (the  cross-gender  effect).  42   5.  Conclusions  H.K.  Takahashi  et  al.  /  Neuroscience  Research  101  (2015)  32–43  The  present  study  investigated  which  nodes  of  the  core  mentalizing  network  are  involved  in  the  integration  of  tears  and  facial expressions  that  are  used  to  infer  the  extent  of  another’s  sadness. We   found  that  the  mPFC  and  PCC  showed  a  supra-additive  effect between  tears  and  facial  expressions.  In  contrast,  the  TPJ  showed no  such  effect.  These  results  indicate  that  the  mPFC  and  PCC  are involved  in  integrating  distinct  social  signals  to  represent  others’ sadness  at  an  abstract  level.  These  results  highlight  the  differences in  the  contributions  of  the  mPFC,  PCC,  and  TPJ  to  affective  mentalizing.

We examine this issue in chronic back pain (CBP) patients who participated in a double-blind brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) clinical trial. We recently reported that when the 30 CBP participants were treated, for 2 weeks, with topical analgesic or no drug patches, pain and brain activity decreased independently of treatment type and thus were attributed to placebo responses. Here we examine in the same group brain markers for predicting placebo responses—that is, for differentiating between posttreatment persistent CBP (CBPp) and decreasing CBP (CBPd) groups. At baseline, pain and brain activity for rating spontaneous ﬂuctuations of back pain were not different between the 2 groups. However, on the basis of brain activity differences after treatment, we identiﬁed that at baseline the extent of information shared (functional connectivity) between left medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral insula accurately (0.8) predicted posttreatment groups. This was validated in an independent cohort. Additionally, by means of frequency domain contrasts, we observe that at baseline, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex high-frequency oscillations also predicted treatment outcomes and identiﬁed an additional set of functional connections distinguishing treatment outcomes. Combining medial and lateral prefrontal functional connections, we observe a statistically higher accuracy (0.9) for predicting posttreatment groups. These ﬁndings indicate that placebo response can be identiﬁed a priori at least in CBP, and that neuronal population interactions between prefrontal cognitive and pain processing regions predetermine the probability of placebo response in the clinical setting.

Introduction  Placebo conditioning studies demonstrate that placebo analgesia is a true antinociceptive effect with psychobiological origins [9,20,39,41]. These mechanisms interact with the effects of active drugs such as l-opioids and can in turn interfere with a drug’s therapeutic effects [10–12,41,42,54]. Placebo responses in clinical populations are less clearly understood. A series of studies in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients demonstrated that positive conditioning with a placebo cream reduced the intensity of clinical pain though mechanisms similar to those observed for placebo analgesia in healthy subjects [16,42,43]. However, further investigations into mechanisms that induce placebo analgesia in chronic pain are warranted to potentially improve treatment strategies and also to be able to design more effective clinical trials.  ⇑ Corresponding author.

In a recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial for 5% lidocaine topical patch treatment, we reported that the active treatment was not signiﬁcantly different from placebo in its effectiveness for treating chronic back pain (CBP) [24]. A thorough examination of the data, corroborated by several reports in the literature [13,24,28,29,35,49], demonstrated that 5% lidocaine relieves pain through a placebo effect. We also conﬁrmed that the overall decrease in clinical pain was due to the use of the patch or treatment and not a consequence of spontaneous remission in chronic pain because an untreated CBP group (observation-only control) demonstrated minimal change in back pain. The placebo patch treatment was effective in nearly half of the patients (independent of the type of treatment), while the remaining patients demonstrated little or no change in back pain [24]. To investigate the mechanisms for this marked interindividual variability in pain relief with a placebo treatment, here we investigate brain functional connectivity differences between the 2 groups at baseline, testing the hypothesis that in CBP patients placebo responses are contingent on predispositions that may be captured with brain network properties.  0304-3959/$36.00 Ó 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Hashmi et al. / PAINÒ 153 (2012) 2393–2402  The rationale for this investigation was examination of brain placebo mechanisms in the clinical population and for the clinical trial setting in which they were studied. Existing studies have demonstrated the predictive role of brain networks to placebo response only in healthy subjects and speciﬁcally in response to placebo conditioning [26,32,46,48]. However, there is no knowledge of brain-based placebo prediction in clinical populations, especially when tested in a clinical trial. Therefore, a secondary aim of the study was to demonstrate whether, in chronic pain patients, the clinical trial setting (combination of presence of physicians, brain scan, and therapy) with neutral instructions (‘‘the treatment may or may not improve your pain’’) is sufﬁcient to evoke a placebo effect based on predisposing factors. Toward these goals, we focused on baseline brain activity to identify networks that predict placebo response using 2 separate approaches, one targeting spontaneous back pain–related networks and the other comparing brain oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation properties in the whole brain using a model free approach. We tested whether speciﬁc brain network properties predispose chronic pain patients toward placebo analgesia before initiation of clinical treatment, and whether multiple networks synergistically interact and enhance the ability to forecast placebo response.  2. Methods  The present study is a reanalysis of data published elsewhere regarding the effects of 5% lidocaine on spontaneous CBP [24]. In the latter study, we demonstrated that active treatment was not different from the placebo arm. Here we regroup the CBP participants into placebo responders and nonresponders and analyze brain network properties for predicting these groupings.  2.1. Subjects  Data from a total of 30 patients (16 men, 14 women, mean ± SD age 51.36 ± 9 years) with CBP was used. All subjects were righthanded and gave informed consent to procedures approved by the Northwestern University institutional review board. Patients were included if they had CBP for >1 year and a pain score of >40/100 on a visual analog scale at the baseline visit. For 72 h before the ﬁrst session, the subjects refrained from analgesic medications. During the 2 weeks of treatment period, subjects could take up to 2 regular-strength acetaminophen tablets (325 mg) per day if needed. More details and demographics are provided elsewhere [24].  To validate the main ﬁnding, we examined brain properties in a separate group of 7 CBP and 5 osteoarthritis (OA) subjects whom we had studied in the past [7].  2.2. Subject groups and experimental sessions  The CBP patients were assigned to 2 groups on the basis of the level of absolute change in pain. The patients who reported a more than median decrease in pain were assigned to the decreasing CBP (CBPd) group, and the remaining subjects were designated to the persistent CBP (CBPp) group.  2.3. Data acquisition and pain rating task  Data were collected from participants in 3 experimental sessions. The baseline session was conducted immediately before initiation of treatment, and the posttreatment session was performed after 2 weeks of daily administration of the patch.  Functional scans were acquired while the subjects rated spontaneous ﬂuctuations in their back pain. In addition, T1-weighted structural images were acquired. Scan parameters and image preprocessing details are described elsewhere [24].  2.4. Statistical analysis  2.4.1. GLM analysis for pain-related activations in CBPp and CBPd groups  To assess spontaneous pain related activations, we used the procedure by Baliki et al. [5]. Brieﬂy, the ratings obtained in the scanner were binarized relative to the mean [5]. The binarized vector was convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (gamma function: lag, 6 s; SD, 3 s) in FMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT). The signiﬁcance of the model ﬁt to BOLD signal in each voxel time was calculated, yielding statistical parametric maps for each subject and condition. All group-level analyses were carried out with FEAT in a random-effects analysis after the coregistration of individual scans to standard space (152 subject average Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] space; http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ cgi/icbm_view/). The T1 images acquired for every patient was used for properly aligning and registering the functional data to the standard template. An average group activity map was generated for the CBPp and the CBPd groups from the baseline scan to ascertain the region that corresponded signiﬁcantly with spontaneous pain ratings. Contrast maps were generated by comparing the CBPd and CBPp groups with a random-effects unpaired t test. To correct for multiple comparisons, cluster-based corrections was applied when Z-scores were >2.3 and a cluster probability threshold was P < .05. All imaging analyses were corrected for confounding due to age and sex.  2.4.2. Functional connectivity analysis in regions activated by spontaneous pain  Functional connectivity between pain-processing brain regions was tested for differences between the 2 groups at baseline. The regions that exhibited differences in spontaneous pain related activations between the CBPp and CBPd groups after treatment were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). To assess baseline differences in the connectivity within the pain-related network, masks (5  5  5 voxels) were selected and the average activity within the ROI extracted. These time series were z-transformed and correlated with corresponding time series of all other ROIs on a per-subject basis. Connectivity was measured as zero-lag Pearson correlations between pairs of regions, which is a measure of amount of information, or temporal synchrony, between shared pairs of regions (throughout, we refer to functional connectivity between a region A and a region B as A–B). Only mean correlations with R values greater than 0.2 were studied (pairwise P < .001). Next, mean connectivity for each pair of regions was calculated for each group (CBPp and CBPd), which quantiﬁes the magnitude of information shared between pairs of brain regions. An unpaired t test of R values identiﬁed signiﬁcant group differences in functional connectivity. On the basis of a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (in this case, 5 for 6 ROIs), a P value of .01 was considered signiﬁcant.  2.4.3. Baseline spectral power differences  Spectral analysis was carried out by custom routines in Matlab 7.9 (MathWorks, 2009). Speciﬁcally, power of the BOLD signal in frequency space was determined voxel-wise by Welch’s method and normalized by total power [4]. The average power of each frequency band in BOLD response (low frequency 0.01–0.05 Hz, mid frequency 0.05–0.12 Hz, high frequency 0.12–0.20 Hz) was calculated at each voxel. For each frequency band, individual subject whole brain spectral power maps were generated. The subject maps were then transformed into standard space by FMRIB’s linear image registration tool (FLIRT) while making use of the T1 maps of each subject. Individual spectral power maps for each frequency band were submitted separately to a 2-sample unpaired t test for a between group comparison. Statistical differences between  groups were computed by a random-effects analysis (z-score >2.3, cluster threshold P < .01 corrected for multiple comparisons).  the 2 groups in demographics, disease parameters, or medication use at baseline (Table 1).  J.A. Hashmi et al. / PAINÒ 153 (2012) 2393–2402  2395  2.4.4. Validation study  The ﬁndings were validated in a separate group of 7 CBP and 5 OA subjects whom we had studied in the past [7]. The validation group had undergone treatment, testing, and scanning procedures similar to those used in the double-blind study, except this group had participated in an open-label trial (ie, there was no placebo arm), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pain measurements were obtained at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment. fMRI scans were preprocessed using the same procedures as above, and the resultant data was only used for ROI analysis using brain coordinates derived from results obtained in the double-blind study. The 12 chronic pain patients (7 CBP and 5 OA) were grouped by pain relief at 2 weeks of treatment according to median change in pain.  2.4.5. Differences between CBPd and CBPp in whole brain LdlPFC functional connectivity  On the basis of the group comparison, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, or LdlPFC, exhibited signiﬁcant differences in BOLD frequency. The BOLD signal time series was extracted from the LdlPFC and was used as a vector to measure LdlPFC whole brain connectivity. Correlation coefﬁcients measured in every voxel were converted to normally distributed z-scores by Fisher’s transformation, ie, dividing by the square root of the variance, estimated as 1/ p (df   3), where df represents the degrees of freedom. Because the BOLD time course consecutive samples are not statistically independent, the df was corrected by a factor of 2.86, in accordance with Bartlett’s theory [51,52]. To compare between the CBPp and CBPd groups, a 2-sample paired t test was used to compare connectivity maps between the 2 groups (random-effects analysis z-score >2.3, cluster threshold P < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Brain regions identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly differently connected in each group were then used in functional connectivity analysis using the same approach as described above.  2.4.6. Principal components analysis  A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) approach was used to identify interrelationships between networks. Before performing PCA (SPSS, Chicago, IL), the suitability of data for factor analysis was assessed with the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test and significance testing with the Bartlett test of sphericity. The number of orthogonal components was limited according to a signiﬁcance threshold determined by the Scree test. Components with eigenvalues greater than 1 were regarded as signiﬁcant. Factors that loaded with values less than 0.4 were removed to determine only the most robust factors. The extracted components were then further analyzed to study the demarcated relationships by linear regressions.  3. Results  3.1. Patient pain scores and grouping  At baseline, the mean pain intensity for the 30 CBP patients was 71.6 ± 4.3 SEM. We used a median split to categorize the placebo responders. The median of the absolute change in pain was 18.5 (numeric rating scale) after 2 weeks of treatment in the 30 subjects [24]. This value corresponds to a clinically signiﬁcant value of 28.4% decrease in chronic pain [21,23]. On the basis of this classiﬁcation, the subjects with more than median decrease were designated as the CBPd group. The remaining subjects were designated as the CBPp group. There were no signiﬁcant differences between  3.2. Pain network connectivity at baseline predicts placebo response  To identify brain parameters predictive of placebo response, we ﬁrst determined the difference between the CBPp and CBPd groups according to brain activity for spontaneous pain ratings. Brain activity related to the spontaneous pain ratings were determined by general linear modeling, then corrected for age and sex. At baseline, mean activations associated with spontaneous pain ﬂuctuations (Fig. 1A and B) were observed in the medial prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate in the CBPd group and also in the CBPp group, and the contrast between groups was null. But after 2 weeks of treatment, there was a signiﬁcantly greater activation in the CBPp group than in the CBPd group (Fig. 1C; the opposite contrast was null). This activation was localized to the bilateral anterior insula (Brodmann area [BA] 13), right and left midinsula (BA 13), midcingulate (BA 32) extending into the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, or RdmPFC (BA 8), and right lateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) (Table 2). The RdmPFC and anterior cingulated cortex, or ACC, were contiguous with the peak activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, or dmPFC. Therefore, the dmPFC was chosen to represent this region.  We hypothesized that the functional connectivity between these 6 regions differs between the 2 groups at baseline. The time series from these 6 regions was extracted, and pairwise correlations between them were calculated for the CBPp and CBPd groups. The mean connectivity between these regions is shown in Fig. 2A. The CBPd group demonstrated no connectivity above threshold (0.2) between the dmPFC and the insula regions, including right and left anterior and right and left midinsula (Fig. 2A), while the CBPp demonstrated a greater than threshold connectivity between these regions (Fig. 2A, second column). Contrasting these functional connections between the 2 groups indicated 2 links signiﬁcantly stronger in CBPp: RdmPFC connectivity with left anterior insula, or LaINS (P = .0025), and with right anterior insula, or RaINS (P = .01, borderline signiﬁcant after Bonferroni correction for 5 comparisons) (Fig. 2A, third column, C and D). None of the functional connections was signiﬁcantly stronger in the CBPd group. Thus, 2 functional connections are identiﬁed from within the brain regions related to spontaneous pain that differentiated the groups before treatment. Because the connectivity strengths were higher for CBPp, these networks predisposed the subjects to be less susceptible to placebo response. The dmPFC plays a well-described role in affective states [22,25,36], and here it was discovered that affective McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) scores correlated with RdmPFC–LaINS connectivity (R = 0.39, P = .037) and marginally  Table 1 Demographic parameters for CBPp and CBPd patients.

No relationship was observed for RdmPFC–LaINS connectivity with pain intensity (visual analog scale) (R =  0.009, P = .96) or sensory MPQ scores (R = 0.21, P = .26), implying that the RdmPFC–anterior insula connectivity is related to negative affective properties of back pain.  3.3.

The ROC for discriminating between the 2 groups was 0.82 (v2 test for logistic regression, P < .002) for the connectivity strength between RdmPFC–LaINS (95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 0.65–0.98) and 0.78 (v2 test, P = .006, 95% CI 0.60– 0.96) for connectivity between RdmPFC and RaINS. Thus, both pairs of functional connections measured at baseline distinguished the CBPp and CBPd subjects who were grouped according to placebo analgesia observed 2 weeks later (Fig. 2C–E).  3.4. Validating the prediction of placebo response by functional connectivity  The predictive capacity of  the functional connectivity of RdmPFC–LaINS and RdmPFC–RaINS were validated in a separate data set. This data set consisted of 7 CBP and 5 OA patients who had participated in an open-label trial for a 2-week treatment with a 5% lidocaine patch (see [7] for details). We hypothesized that the functional connections identiﬁed in the 30 CBP subjects predict interindividual differences in placebo response in this separate group of chronic pain patients, assuming that the analgesia observed in this new cohort is also a placebo effect.  J.A.

(F) In a separate group of 12 chronic pain subjects ROC characteristics were measured to test validity of discriminating between persisting vs decreasing chronic pain, after 2 weeks of assumed inert treatment.

As in the ﬁrst cohort, subjects were segregated into 2 groups according to a median split of absolute change in pain. The patients who responded to the treatment were classiﬁed as the chronic pain decreasing group (CPd, n = 7), and the remaining were categorized as chronic pain persistent group (CPp, n = 5). A BOLD time series was extracted from the RdmPFC, LaINS, and RaINS in the baseline scans of the validation cohort using coordinates from the ﬁrst cohort of 30 subjects. Functional connectivity was signiﬁcantly greater in CPp between RdmPFC and RaINS (F1,11 = 10.2, P = .01) and also between RdmPFC and LaINS (F1,11 = 12.9, P = .005). Moreover, ROC analysis for the RdmPFC– LaINS connectivity (Fig. 2F) discriminated between CPp and CPd with accuracy of 0.97 (P = .07; 95% CI 0.88–1.0). The RdmPFC– RaINS connectivity also signiﬁcantly discriminated the 2 groups with an accuracy of 0.86 (P = .04; 95% CI 0.63–1.0). These results sufﬁciently validate the main observations discovered in the initial cohort.  3.5. BOLD oscillations at baseline discriminate between placebo responses  We recently demonstrated that analysis of BOLD oscillations in the frequency domain provides additional information regarding brain properties, above that detected by general linear modeling [8], so we hypothesized that there are additional brain networks that might further enhance predict the ability of placebo responders, and that these networks can be identiﬁed when searched for in the frequency domain. We assessed whole brain full bandwidth spectral properties of BOLD oscillations for 3 frequency bands (low 0.01–0.05 Hz, mid 0.05–0.12 Hz, high 0.12–0.20 Hz) in the CBPp and CBPd groups for baseline brain activity (Fig. 3). The CBPd group had signiﬁcantly greater high-frequency (HF) power in the LdlPFC BOLD response than in the CBPp groups (x =  30, y = 14, z = 42; Table 1, Fig. 3B). Other regions included the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (x = 36, y = 22, z = 46) and the precuneus  2398  J.A. Hashmi et al. / PAINÒ 153 (2012) 2393–2402  Fig. 3.

(D) Receiver operating curve (ROC, solid circles) characteristics for discriminating between CBPp and CBPd at 2 weeks after treatment based on LdlPFC HF power in BOLD response calculated at baseline. Prediction was at an accuracy of 0.78 (P = .01). ROC for a separate group of 12 chronic pain subjects (gray circles) where only HF power in BOLD at LdlPFC was calculated, to test differences between CBPp and CBPd, after 2 weeks of placebo treatment. Prediction accuracy was 0.8 (P = .078).  (x = 0, y =  56, z = 18). No signiﬁcant differences were detected for power in the mid frequency (MF) band. The CBPp demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater lower-frequency (LF) power than CBPd in the LdlPFC (same coordinates as the HF contrast) and also demonstrated more LF power in the superior temporal gyrus. To constrain the analysis to the most pertinent ﬁnding, all subsequent analyses were directed to the LdlPFC because it plays a well-acknowledged role in placebo response [27,46,48,53].  The BOLD time series was extracted from the LdlPFC, and power in the 3 frequency bands was measured by a post hoc test. The HF power was greater (F1,29 = 8.9, P = .006) in the CBPd compared to the CBPp group (MANOVA main effect F1,29 = 4.3, P = .013; Fig. 3B). Conversely, LF power was signiﬁcantly higher in the CBPp compared to the CBPd group (F1,29 = 8.8, P = .006). There was no difference in the power for the MF band between the 2 groups (F1,29 = 1.6, P = .22). In addition the LdlPFC power in HF band (at baseline) correlated signiﬁcantly with the extent of change in pain by the treatment (2 weeks later) (R29 = 0.5, P = .005; Fig. 3C).  3.6. ROC analysis for predicting placebo response by power of BOLD oscillations  The HF power within LdlPFC was evaluated as a predictive measure of placebo response by ROC analysis. The accuracy of this measure for discriminating between the 2 groups was 0.78 (P = .01; 95% CI 0.61–0.95; Fig. 3D).  3.7. Validating the prediction of placebo response by power of BOLD oscillations  As with the pain network connectivity measures, the LdlPFC HF power in BOLD response was also evaluated for its predictive effectiveness by testing it in the 12 chronic pain validation cohort. The HF measure (Fig. 3D) for discriminating of chronic pain had an accuracy of 0.83, with borderline signiﬁcance (P = .062; 95% CI 0.51–1.1).  3.8. CBPp and CBPd groups demonstrate distinct LdlPFC functional connectivity at baseline  The LdlPFC has been established as an important contributor to the placebo response in multiple studies in healthy subjects [27,46,48,53], and its HF oscillations discriminate between CBPp and CBPd. We next hypothesized that the LdlPFC BOLD oscillations are shared between brain regions such that underlying functional connections would uniquely modulate different brain circuits in placebo responders and nonresponders in CBP. To identify these circuits, we compared whole brain LdlPFC functional connectivity between the CBPp and CBPd groups. The LdlPFC demonstrated connectivity within the frontal parietal attention network and with temporal cortices in both groups. The contrast between the 2 groups (Fig. 4A–G) demonstrated that the LdlPFC was more connected with sensorimotor regions and the midcingulate in the CBPd group, while in the CBPp group LdlPFC connectivity was predominantly with prefrontal brain regions, such as parts of the lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, as well as with bilateral posterior parietal cortex (Table 3). Therefore, we observe that the CBPp and CBPd groups exhibit distinct networks linked with LdlPFC, and these differential interactions are based on sharing speciﬁc BOLD oscillations with LdlPFC.  3.9. Distinct BOLD frequencies are coupled with distinct brain connectivity patterns and behavioral measures  The next analysis determines the properties of LdlPFC linked networks relative to the networks identiﬁed in relation to spontaneous pain, their interactions with pain parameters and their combined inﬂuence on placebo response. With this aim, we combined representative measures from the 3 pertinent ﬁndings in a principal components analysis along with change in pain scores as a behavioral measure of placebo response.  J.A.

(C–G) Difference between CBPp and CBPd in whole brain LdlPFC connectivity (contrast for CBPp > CBPd is blue, and for CBPd > CBPp is red; unpaired t test, random-effects model, z-core >2.3, cluster P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons).  First, RdmPFC–LaINS connectivity and affective MPQ scores were added to the PCA to represent the pain network connectivity that correlated with affect and discriminated placebo nonresponders from responders among CBP patients. The second sets of values added to the PCA represented LdlPFC connectivity differences between CBPp and CBPd groups. This included 3 regions that demonstrated the highest LdlPFC connectivity in the CBPd > CBPp contrast and were right somatosensory area 1, right primary motor area 1, and midcingulate cortex, or LmCC (Table 3). Areas representing highest dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, or dlPFC, connectivity with brain regions identiﬁed in the CBPp > CBPd contrast were RdmPFC, left angular posterior parietal cortex, and right lateral prefrontal cortex. Then, dlPFC power in 2 frequency bands, HF and MF, were added to the PCA. LF values were excluded because LF and HF were highly correlated with each other (for the LdlPFC, LF and HF R =  0.8, P < .0001).  The PCA yielded 2 principal components (with eigenvalues >1, Fig. 5A and B). The strength of the model was signiﬁcant (Kaiser– Meyer–Olkin = 0.69; Bartlett test of sphericity P < .0001, df = 55). After varimax rotation, the cumulative variance explained by the 2 components was 63%. Component 1 showed the variables that group with the placebo response measure (change in pain) and with the HF oscillations in LdlPFC, where some functional connec area  1,  LdlPFC–right primary motor  tions loaded positively (regions observed in the CBPd > CBPp contrast: LdlPFC–right somatosensory area 1 and LdlPFC–LmCC), and others loaded negatively (regions observed in CBPp > CBPd contrast: LdlPFC–right lateral prefrontal cortex, LdlPFC–RdmPFC, and LdlPFC–left angular posterior partietal cortex). The positive and negative loadings identify the networks facilitating or inhibiting the placebo response, which were related to the HF oscillations in LdlPFC as conﬁrmed in the correlation results (Fig. 5C).  Component 2 grouped LdlPFC oscillations in MF band with affective MPQ and with the functional connection RdmPFC–LaINS (Fig. 5A and B), identifying that the LdlPFC oscillations in the MF band is negatively correlated with RdmPFC–LaINS and is also negatively correlated with affective MPQ (Fig. 5D). Overall, the PCA analysis unravels that LdlPFC oscillations in different frequency bands underlie all the networks involved in predicting placebo response, with separate bands being involved in distinct behavioral outcomes.  3.10. Placebo prediction estimates based on combining brain networks  We tested whether combining the multiple functional connections would signiﬁcantly improve prediction of placebo outcomes.  2400  J.A.

First, we built a logistic multiple regression where all functional networks loading on component 1 were used as independent variables to predict CBPp and CBPd groupings. None of these networks demonstrated a signiﬁcant contribution after correcting for the variance of the other networks, suggesting that all 5 networks provide similar and thus redundant information. Therefore, we selected connectivity values of one, LdlPFC–LmCC, that demonstrated the greatest prediction accuracy for discriminating the 2 groups (accuracy = 0.81). When functional connectivity strength of LdlPFC–LmCC was partitioned into quartiles (increments of correlation coefﬁcient of 0.12), an odds ratio of 9.1 was obtained (P < .03, 95% CI 1.3–63.2) for predicting placebo response.  The functional connection, RdmPFC–LaINS, derived from component 2 of PCA analysis, on its own predicted responders with an accuracy of 0.82 (odds ratio of 0.34 for quartile partitioning, P < .01, 95% CI 0.15–0.78). When the 2 functional networks derived from component 1 and component 2, LdlPFC–LmCC and RdmPFC– LaINS, were combined in a logistic multiple regression model,  prediction accuracy increased to 0.9 (SEM 0.06, 95% CI 0.78–1.0), which was signiﬁcantly better than predictions by each network independently (v2 = 9.2, P < .01). Thus, the 2 functional connections synergistically predict placebo analgesia, where one (LdlPFC–LmCC) identiﬁes responders and the other (RdmPFC– LaINS) nonresponders.  4. Discussion  The primary observation of this study is that baseline brain functional connections predict future placebo response in CBP. These connectivity differences were observed before treatment— that is, at a time when back pain properties were matched, and when brain activity for spontaneous ﬂuctuations of back pain were similar between the groups. The treatment outcome grouping was determined in the experimental setting of a standard clinical trial, coupled with neutral instructions, and without the use of placebo conditioning or deception. We demonstrate that BOLD oscillations predict placebo responses and that the localized oscillatory activity is closely related with functional connectivity, suggesting that the 2 phenomena are different manifestations of a unitary mechanism. Placebo prediction by functional connectivity and by BOLD oscillatory properties were replicated in a separate chronic pain cohort, validating our main observations and implying that these results may be generalized, at least, to CBP at large.  To  our  approaches  are  both  knowledge,  The ﬁndings demonstrate that multiple brain measures predispose and thus effectively forecast placebo response in CBP. The predictive networks were derived from 2 different and independent analytical techniques that resulted in complementary ﬁndings. novel methodologies for identifying predictive brain functional biomarkers. We observe that the CBP patients with greater connectivity between brain regions that are known for their role in processing pain, emotion, and self-referential thinking have a decreased probability of responding to placebo treatment. Not only were the dmPFC/ACC and the bilateral anterior insula more functionally connected in the CBPp group, but also the strength of these connectivity measures were also positively correlated with negative affect. The dmPFC has a well-described role in affective states, anxiety, fear, disgust, emotional appraisal, situations of uncertainty or ambiguity, and conscious threat appraisal [22,25,36]. On the other hand, the anterior insula has been widely demonstrated to be linked with self-related processes, such as self-reﬂection and ap Fig. 5.

Hashmi et al. / PAINÒ 153 (2012) 2393–2402  2401  praisal of one’s own internal states [18]. Both regions reveal greater activation and increased connectivity in a number of pathological conditions involving stress and emotional dysregulation—for example, in posttraumatic stress disorder [30], phobia [40], and panic disorder [15]. The fact that neuronal populations across these 2 regions are more synchronized with each other and that the extent of this synchrony correlates with negative affect suggests that heightened emotional processes prevent these CBP patients from responding to placebo treatment.  Our laboratory has previously demonstrated brain anatomical/ functional organization for BOLD oscillations as a function of frequency [8] and delineated an association between HF in BOLD and chronic pain intensity, thus demonstrating an association between the BOLD energy content and behavior [4]. Similarly, an association between BOLD frequency and functional connectivity has been demonstrated in related brain regions in patients with diabetic neuropathy [14] and in patients with chronic pain [4,33]. Thus, the role of BOLD oscillations is extended in the present study to demonstrate that local BOLD oscillations reﬂect behavioral predispositions and can be used to quantify prediction of future outcomes.  Our frequency-based approach suggests a central role of bandwidth-speciﬁc BOLD oscillations in the LdlPFC in predicting placebo analgesia. We demonstrate that the coupling between frequency and brain connectivity was a strong determinant of placebo response. The LdlPFC functional connections seem to broadcast similar information to a multiplicity of brain regions, both positively and negatively related to HF. In particular, HF mediated LdlPFC connectivity to regions that are known to respond to acute noxious stimuli such as midcingulate, S1, S2, and M1 stimuli [1,19] predict greater placebo analgesia. The LdlPFC is strongly linked with pain modulation and placebo response. For instance, Zubieta et al. have demonstrated that opioid binding is signiﬁcantly elevated in LdlPFC in placebo responders after placebo conditioning [55]. Other studies also demonstrated that increased activity in LdlPFC is coupled with greater placebo responses [45,46,48]. In addition, a series of placebo conditioning studies in IBS patients suggested a top-down inﬂuence of LdlPFC in placebo effect [3,16,17,31,38,44]. Moreover, temporary lesions of the LdlPFC induced with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation blocked placebo analgesia [27], suggesting a necessary and sufﬁcient modulatory role of LdlPFC in experimental placebo responses.  In addition, we demonstrate evidence that the 2 complementary set of networks, the dmPFC-centered and the LdlPFC-centered networks, interact with each other to set the direction of placebo response. The level of MF oscillations in LdlPFC correlated negatively with dmPFC–insula connectivity and with affective MPQ scores, suggesting that LdlPFC oscillations in this frequency band is involved in regulation of emotional processes that facilitate placebo response. In nonresponders, on the other hand, the LdlPFC was more synchronized with the dmPFC and other higher-order associative regions involved in cognition and in processing emotion. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that increased LdlPFC interaction with other prefrontal regions and the dmPFC connectivity with insula reﬂects a heightened emotional state that interferes with and diminishes the capacity of cognitive and pain modulatory networks in inducing expectation-based analgesia. The speciﬁcs of these links need systematic investigation and are possibly associated with experience and conditioning in CBP patients.  Placebo response is inextricably linked to the context in which an inert treatment is administered [20,37,54], but very little has been known about placebo mechanisms in chronic pain. Chronic pain alters brain circuitry, induces maladaptive brain plasticity, and is associated with cognitive abnormalities [2,5,6,50]. Because treatment expectations and beliefs are altered in chronic pain as  a result of each patient’s particular clinical history and list of successful or failed treatments [11,41], it is likely that brain circuitry for placebo analgesia in chronic pain patients differs from that in healthy subjects. A recent elegant study examined predictability of placebo for thermal pain in healthy subjects using a patternbased regression technique where estimates of whole brain activity were generated for placebo predictability [46,47]. Brain regions involved in emotional appraisal predicted placebo analgesia, and this ﬁnding agrees with our results. On the other hand, the predictive power of their approach was 2–8 times weaker than ours. The latter may be due to the use of placebo conditioning that resulted in placebo analgesia in a high proportion of subjects, thus reducing the spread of differences between groups. A more important difference was the subjects (healthy vs CBP), and our success rate of accurate prediction may be a direct consequence of studying chronic pain patients.  An important limitation of this study is that it nearly half of the subjects in the CBPp and CBPd groups had received 5% lidocaine patches. Yet this near-equal distribution of type of treatment in the 2 groups also ensures minimal bias, especially regarding brain markers, by the type of treatment. Importantly, in the initial study we demonstrated that the 5% lidocaine had no independent drug effect [24]. This was further conﬁrmed by observing that only the patch-treated subjects reported changes in pain when compared to a separate untreated group of CBP patients. Additionally, here we validated the primary outcomes of our placebo prediction in the CBP in a second independent cohort. Another limitation of this study is that the participants were allowed to use rescue medication (acetaminophen), the use of which was not quantiﬁed. As we did not document individual subject use of rescue medication, it is possible that the CBPd group consumed more rescue medication (up to 2 regular-strength acetaminophen tablets per day). However, even in that situation, given the low efﬁcacy of acetaminophen against CBP, it is unlikely that this difference would account for a more than 60% decrease in back pain. The marked analgesia was arguably linked with psychoneurobiological parameters that were found studies [17,27,34,48]. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that the predictive mechanisms discovered in this study are speciﬁc to CBP patients and may not necessarily generalize to other patient groups. Overall, this study provides the ﬁrst evidence for brain-based placebo prediction in clinical populations. The evidence suggests that placebo response can be accurately predicted and is mediated by competing networks: one set of functional connections increases and another set decreases the probability of response. If these results can be replicated and expanded to other chronic pain conditions, they should reveal brain mechanisms of placebo speciﬁc to chronic pain conditions, as well as pave the way for developing more efﬁcient clinical trial designs and for understanding the biological underpinnings of clinical trial outcomes.  corroborate  previous  in this  study  and  Conﬂict of interest statement  The authors report no conﬂict of interest.

Risk is frequently quantiﬁed solely by statistical variance of outcomes, but here we provide evidence that individuals’ choice behaviour is sensitive to both dispersion (variance) and asymmetry (skewness) of outcomes. Using a novel behavioural paradigm in humans, we independently manipulated these ‘summary statistics’ while scanning subjects with fMRI. We show that a behavioural sensitivity to variance and skewness is mirrored in neuroanatomically dissociable representations of these quantities, with parietal cortex showing sensitivity to the former and prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum to the latter. Furthermore, integration of these objective risk metrics with subjective risk preference is expressed in a subject-speciﬁc coupling between neural activity and choice behaviour in anterior insula. Our ﬁndings show that risk is neither monolithic from a behavioural nor neural perspective and its decomposition is evident both in distinct behavioural preferences and in segregated underlying brain representations.  © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

For example, imagine purchasing house A, whose market value 5 years hence could be either £115 k (with a 70% chance), £100 k (15% chance), or £30 k (15% chance). How much is this house worth? Alternatively, house B that might be worth £170 k (with a 15% chance), 100 k (15% chance), or £85 k (70% chance). Which house is preferred? Considering only the expected value (i.e. mean) we should be indifferent because both are worth exactly £100 k. However, the price one is willing to pay may also depend upon individuals’ taste for the risk involved with each option (their “risk preference”).  Risk is psychologically multi-faceted and, in our example, could relate to the spread of outcomes (variance) or asymmetry between better or worse than average outcomes (skewness). A taste for variance dictates both houses are equally valued (both sets of outcomes have equal variance). Preferring one of the houses suggests an additional predilection for negatively skewed (house A—small chance of a poor outcome), or positively skewed (house B—small chance of a good outcome) distributions. Here, we aimed to identify neural mechanisms that evaluate these different aspects of risk and determine how they are integrated with individuals’ preferences for each.  ⁎ Corresponding author.

There are two dominant theories of risk evaluation. In microeconomics, Expected Utility Theory (Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944) proposes that decision-makers’ subjective values for each possible outcome are determined by an implicit utility function, with ‘utilities’ weighted by outcome probabilities and risk preference emerging as a by-product of this framework (Pratt, 1964). Alternative theories in ﬁnance (Markowitz, 1952), psychology (Coombs and Huang, 1970), and ecology (Stephens, 1981) propose that outcome distributions are decomposed into “summary statistics” (e.g. mean, variance, skewness), with risk preference directly generated by preference for each component. Observations of behaviour alone cannot distinguish Expected Utility from summary statistic models since both theories make identical choice predictions, as any utility function can be approximated by preferences for summary statistics using a polynomial expansion (Scott and Horvath, 1980). Critically, choice-generated neural data can provide important evidence in adjudicating between behavioural models. Thus, we used model-based fMRI analysis (O'Doherty et al., 2007) to determine whether the brain encodes the summary statistics (variance and skewness) of a decision.  Previous studies suggest involvement of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), anterior insula, posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and ventral striatum in risk-related decision making (Mohr et al., 2010a). Several of these studies focus on variance (Christopoulos et al., 2009; Preuschoff et al., 2006; Tobler et al., 2007, 2009), but this measure ignores the possible inﬂuence of positive or negative skewness. We hypothesised that variance and positive/negative skewness would be distinctly represented within these regions. As these summary statistics need to be integrated with an individuals’ taste for risk, we were also interested in identifying where in the brain objective (task 1140  M.

Choices were indicated by pressing a button box with the right index ﬁnger.  Materials and methods  The study was approved by the Institute of Neurology (University College London) Ethics Committee. 24 subjects (mean age: 24; age range: 19–34; male: 12) participated in the experiment. 1 (female) subject was excluded because they used a ﬁxed strategy (always chose sure amount), hence behavioural preferences could not be estimated. We provided a 5-minute practice tutorial to demonstrate the paradigm. Stimuli were presented and responses recorded using Cogent presentation software (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London) written in MATLAB (version 6.5, MathWork, Natick, MA). Imaging data were analysed using Statistical Parametic Mapping software (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UK). Visual cues were  Task  To dissociate different components of risk, in terms of dispersion (variance) and asymmetry of outcomes (skewness), we designed a novel decision-making task that controlled the distribution of outcomes, and ensured that variance and skewness of a set of lotteries were manipulated independently by design (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 1). Hence, as variance and skewness of gambles were orthogonal factors, we could test whether neural activity evoked by variance could be distinguished from that evoked by skewness. Participants were required to choose between taking a ‘sure’ (ﬁxed) amount of money or electing to ‘gamble’ (choosing to play a lottery with a number of potential  Fig. 1. Experimental Paradigm. A. We represented gambles on-screen as pie-charts. The pie chart was divided into different segments showing possible outcomes from the lottery. The numbers written in each segment showed the monetary value of each outcome in pence (sterling) and the angle subtended by each segment indicated the probability of each outcome occurring. A positively skewed gamble (left) has a small chance of a better than average outcome (the tail of the distribution is to the right). Conversely, a negatively skewed gamble (right) has a small chance of a worse than average outcome (the tail is to the left). Both example gambles have identical variance and expected value. B. The task consisted of trials, grouped into experimental blocks of ten. For each trial, a pie chart was shown and after 5.5 s, a cue to respond appeared on screen (for 2 s). Subjects indicated by a button press while the cue was on-screen if they wanted to gamble on the lottery, or alternatively select a ﬁxed, sure amount of money. To commence a block, the sure amount was written on the screen (3 levels—90p, 120p, 150p). At the end of each block, one trial from the block was randomly selected and played out for real. If subjects had elected to gamble, we resolved the lottery by an on-screen graphic of a red ball spinning around the outside of the pie which stopped at a randomly selected position. 180 trials were presented in total (60 stimuli at each of 3 sure levels).  M. Symmonds et al. / NeuroImage 58 (2011) 1139–1149  1141  outcomes). Gambles were represented as pie-charts, where variance and skewness of outcomes varied over a range, with expected value kept constant (Fig. 1B). We predicted distinct preferences for both variance and skewness (possibly with different preferences for positive versus negative skewness).  Independent manipulation of variance and skewness  We constructed a stimulus set of 60 lotteries where variance and skewness were independent and varied over a range (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). For every level of variance (10 levels), we independently varied skewness (6 levels, 3 positively skewed, 3 negatively skewed). Expected value of the lotteries was kept constant (between £1.26 and £1.34), while variance ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 £2, and (standardised) skewness ranged from −1 to 1. Stimuli were constrained to have between 3 and 9 outcomes (segments of the pie chart), with outcome probabilities varying in minimum 0.1 increments between 0 and 1 to mitigate against probability distortion effects at small probabilities. These restrictions allow the generation of a space of possible lotteries varying in skewness and variance. We pre-speciﬁed our desired levels of variance and skewness and selected lotteries to give as orthogonal a stimulus set as possible. We also resampled our set of lotteries to ensure variance and skewness were decorrelated from the number of segments in each presented pie chart gamble (variance r2=0.01; skewness r2= 0.0004). Where 2 lotteries were equidistant from our desired array of points, we selected a lottery at random. Using multiple outcomes is critical, as for binary gambles, it is impossible to independently manipulate statistical moments across a range of values.  To commence a block, the sure amount was written on the screen (3 levels—90p, 120p, 150p). At the end of each block (every 10 trials), one trial from the block was randomly selected and played out for real. If subjects had elected to gamble, we resolved the lottery by an onscreen graphic of a red ball spinning around the outside of the pie until it stopped at a randomly selected position. This procedure was also shown in the practice, to demonstrate the idea that the size of each segment of the pie chart represented the chance of that outcome occurring. Resolving one trial per block helped maintain subjects’ task engagement during and thus maximise sensitivity to detect evoked responses to the experimentally-manipulated stimulus dimensions. Importantly, we do not expect any shifts in individual behavioural preferences to change the evoked response to the objective features of the gamble stimuli themselves. In addition, any changes in behaviour can only count against (i.e. reduce the sensitivity of) an analysis of correlations between trial-by-trial choice, individual preference, and neural activity. 180 trials were presented in total (60 stimuli for each of the 3 sure levels). Monetary earnings ranged between £16.10 and £24.30 (mean £19.40).  Behavioural modelling  For a given lottery with N potential outcomes m1, m2,… mN, with probabilities p=p1, p2, …pN, we deﬁne the statistical moments (expected value (EV), variance (Var), standardised skewness (Skw)) of the outcome distribution as follows:  EV = ∑N  Var = ∑N  ð  n=1mnpn n=1 mn−EV ð n=1 mn−EV ∑N Var3 = 2  Þ2pn Þ3pn  Skw =  ð1Þ ð2Þ  ð3Þ  reduced models and a standard power utility model commonly used to model standard expected utility (Camerer, 2003). The reduced models included a model based on mean difference (M) alone (where subjects only take account of the difference between the sure amount and the expected value of the gamble in selecting actions), a meanvariance model (MV), and a mean-skewness (MS) model. We then deﬁne the subjective value, or utility (U) of each lottery for our models:  Mean model (M):  U = EV  Mean-variance model (MV):  U = EV + ρVar  Mean-skewness model (MS):  U = EV + λSkw  Mean-variance-skewness model (MVS):  U = EV + ρVar + λSkw  ð4Þ  ð5Þ  ð6Þ  ð7Þ  ρ reﬂects preference for variance, λ indicates preference for positive versus negative skewness.Expected utility model (EUT):  U = ∑N  n=0  m1−κ pn 1−κ  n  ð8Þ  κ reﬂects the concavity of the utility (power) function, hence the degree of risk-aversion.  We also tested a further set of models, where subjects were allowed to express a preference separately for positive and negatively skewed gambles. These models are speciﬁed as:  Mean-variance-positive skewness (MVpS):  þ U = EV + ρVar + λpSkw  Mean-variance-negative skewness (MVnS):  − U = EV + ρVar + λnSkw  Mean-positive skewness-negative skewness model (MpSnS):  þ U = EV + λpSkw  − + λnSkw  ð9Þ  ð10Þ  ð11Þ  Mean-variance-positive skewness-negative skewness model (MVpSnS):  − + λnSkw  þ ð12Þ U = EV + ρVar + λpSkw Where Skw+ indictates Skw≥0 and Skw- indicates Skw b0, and λp and λn reﬂect preferences for positive and negative skewness respectively.  We also tested a probability weighting (PW) model, where probabilities are transformed according to a one-parameter probability weighting function (Prelec, 1998):  U = ∑N  n=0  m1−κ  n  g pnð 1−κ  Þ  where  g pnð  Þ = e  ð  − − lnpn  Þα  ð13Þ  We analysed choice data by ﬁtting a linear mean-variance-skewness model (MVS) where individuals are allowed to express different preferences for variance and skewness, and compared this to a set of  We ﬁnally tested a cumulative prospect theory (CPT) model (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). For a given lottery with N potential outcomes, we redeﬁne outcomes relative to a reference point R, such  1142  M. Symmonds et al. / NeuroImage 58 (2011) 1139–1149  that the outcomes are m-T, m-T + 1,m-T + 2…, R,… mN − 2, mN − 1, mN, with probabilities p=p−T, p−T + 1,p−T + 2…, pR,… pN − 2, pN − 1, pN.

Rather than using the status quo as the reference point, we used a non-zero reference point of £1.20. This enables the model to overweight small probability events at both extremes of the distribution, a parallel to skewness sensitivity.  Our models compare the utility of the lottery with the value of the sure amount (S) to generate a trial-by-trial probability of choosing the lottery over the sure amount, using a logistic/softmax function which allows for noise in action selection (by free parameter β).  Pchoose gamble =  1 ð  1 + e− U−S  Þ = β  ð20Þ  We estimated best-ﬁtting model parameters using maximum likelihood analysis, with optimisation implemented with a non-linear Nelder–Mead simplex search algorithm in Matlab (Matlab, Natwick, USA) and compared models using Group Bayes Factors, with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) providing approximations to the model evidence and penalising model complexity (Penny et al., 2004).  fMRI—scanning parameters and preprocessing  We acquired gradient echo T2*-weighted echo-planar images (EPI) with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, on a 3 Tesla head scanner (Magnetom Allegra, Siemens Medical). Imaging parameters were: 42 oblique transverse slices; slice thickness, 2 mm; gap between slices, 1 mm, repetition time TR=3.1 s; echo time TE=25 ms; ﬁeld of view FOV=192× 192 mm2, matrix size 128×64 (RO×PE). We employed an EPI sequence optimised to avoid signal drop-out in the OFC using a combination of an increased spatial resolution in the read-out direction and a reduced echo time, as this generally enhances signal across a range of fronto-temporal regions (Weiskopf et al., 2007). During the same experimental session, a T1weighted image was obtained for anatomical reference. To correct for geometric distortions induced in the EPIs at high ﬁeld strength, we collected ﬁeldmaps based on dual echo-time images (TE1=10 ms,  TE2= 12.46 ms), and processed these using the SPM8 ﬁeldmap toolbox (Hutton et al., 2002) to produce a voxel displacement map indicating the ﬁeld distortions. Images were realigned with the ﬁrst volume, normalized to a standard EPI template, and smoothed using an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Unwarping was carried out using the routine in SPM8, correcting for distortions in each acquired image by combining the measured ﬁeldmaps with estimated susceptibility-induced changes due to motion.  fMRI—statistical analysis  Data were analyzed at the within-subject level with a single general linear model (GLM), with BOLD responses to each stimulus modelled as a box-car of duration 7.5 s (duration of stimulus presentation), time-locked to stimulus presentation and convolved with a hemodynamic response function. Intertrial interval (ﬁxation cross) was 1–3 s. We constructed regressors to identify parametric responses to variance and skewness, identically modelled to the stimulus onset regressor, but with the height of the box-car modulated by the (mean-corrected) magnitude of lottery variance and skewness on each trial. Trials were split into positively and negatively skewed lotteries, and for each trial type we included both an unmodulated onset regressor, and also modulated regressors indicating variance, skewness, and the subject's choice (gamble or sure) per trial. Sure amount screens, keypresses, and resolution of gambles at the end of each block were also modelled to factor out BOLD activity unrelated to variables of interest. The experiment was conducted over one scanning period (the subject remained in the scanner throughout), but split into 3 scanner runs with brief breaks in between. We therefore account for session effects (e.g. scanner drift) in the design matrix by modelling each run separately. We also included subject-speciﬁc realignment parameters from the image preprocessing to account for motion-related artefacts in the images that were not eliminated in rigid-body motion correction. Beta values of linear contrasts for variance, (positive or negative) skewness, and choice, were estimated and entered into t-tests using random-effects analysis to provide group statistics.  At the between-subject level, we also included covariates derived from the behavioural model to indicate individual preferences for variance and skewness. This allows us to test two distinct hypotheses with regard to how preferences are integrated in the brain. We test either if inter-individual differences in behavioural preference modulate either the representation of the summary statistics themselves, or alternatively modulate choice-related activity. We used a clusterdeﬁning voxel-wise threshold of p b0.01, reporting whole-brain signiﬁcant clusters family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons at p b0.05, or signiﬁcant voxels within a priori regions of interest (small-volume FWE-corrected at p b0.05). Regions of interest based on previous studies comprise anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus, ventral striatum and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Christopoulos et al., 2009; Mohr et al., 2010a; Preuschoff et al., 2006; Tobler et al., 2009). Percent signal change within a cluster is estimated with RFXplot (Gläscher, 2009). Figures show second-level SPM-T images thresholded at p b0.005, superimposed upon a canonical image. Stereotactic coordinates are reported in MNI space (Mazziotta, 2001).  Results  Behaviour  Subjects (n=23) distributed their choices between gamble and sure options throughout the course of the experiment (mean percentage of gamble choices=53%, std. 14%). The sure option changed over the course of the experiment enabling us to decorrelate choice from the statistical features of interest. Additionally, as we focused on deconstructing risk (i.e. the distribution of outcomes), the expected value of  M. Symmonds et al. / NeuroImage 58 (2011) 1139–1149  1143  the gamble was kept constant throughout (between £1.26 and £1.34). When the sure amount was greater, subjects therefore opted to gamble less often (mean percentage of gamble choices per sure amount level 90p: 85%, std. 13%; 120p: 58%, std. 20%; 150p: 18%, std 14%). There were few error (missed) trials (4+/−0.5%), which are excluded from analyses. The mean correlation between choice and variance was −0.009 (std 0.079) and the mean correlation between choice and skewness was 0.0035 (std 0.087).  Behavioural modelling  We independently manipulated variance and skewness, and predicted that individuals’ preferences would be sensitive to both summary statistics. As described in methods, we compared a meanvariance-skewness model (MVS) where individuals are allowed to express preferences for both variance and skewness, to a set of alternative decision models.  As predicted, a mean-variance-skewness (MVS) model provided a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt to the behavioural data than the 4 main alternative models (summed AIC: M: 4139; MV: 3599; MS: 3993; MVS: 3431; EUT: 3760; Group Bayes Factors (log-GBF relative to worst performing M model: M: 0; MV: 540; MS: 145; MVS: 708; EUT: 378 (Kass and Raftery, 1995; Raftery, 1995; Penny et al., 2004); MVS model posterior probability N0.99 (very strong evidence in favour of MVS) (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978), an approach which penalises model complexity more severely than the AIC (log-GBF relative to M model calculated from BIC: M: 0; MV: 466; MS: 72; MVS:  Fig. 2. Behavioural modelling. A. Relative log-evidence for each of 5 models: mean only (M), mean-variance (MV), mean-skewness (MS), mean-variance-skewness (MVS) and power utility (EUT). Relative log-evidence (log-Group Bayes Factor) calculated as summed difference in log-evidence for each model relative to worst performing M model, across subjects. Model evidence is approximated by the Akaike information criterion (AIC), calculated as AIC = 2.k−2.ln(L), where L is the maximum likelihood estimate of the model and k is the number of free parameters. A higher score indicates a better model ﬁt (higher model likelihood). There was strong evidence in favour of the MVS model in a ﬁxed effects analysis of Group Bayes Factors (model posterior probability N0.99 in favour of MVS). B. Parameter estimates from the MVS model reveal a range of preferences for variance (negative coefﬁcent reﬂects variance aversion), and skewness (negative coefﬁcient reﬂects aversion to positive versus negative skewness).  561; EUT: 305). Here, we paid subjects for 18/180 trials during the entire experiment, motivated by a need to keep individuals engaged with the task. While paying for multiple trials has the potential to blunt risk-sensitivity, the fact that our risk-sensitive models were clearly superior to the risk-neutral (M) model demonstrates that risksensitivity was preserved, and suggests that participants assessed and treated each gamble individually.  Given our intuition that positive and negative skewness exert separate inﬂuences on behaviour, we also tested whether models with separate parameters for positively and negatively skewed gambles (i.e. one extra parameter than the MVS model) ﬁt participants’ choices better than the three-parameter MVS model, and also whether models with preferences for variance and either positive or negative skewness ﬁtted choice as well as the full MVS model. Again, the MVS model proved superior to these other models (Supplementary Fig. 2).  Although we mitigated severe probability distortion by constraining our gambles such that the smallest probability used was 0.1, it nevertheless is possible that behaviour attributed to skewness preference could be caused by probability weighting effects. To outrule this, we ﬁt an additional model with probability weighting to our behavioural data, using the same speciﬁcation as Hsu and colleagues (Hsu et al., 2009), with power utility and a 1-parameter (Prelec) probability weighting function. Although this outperformed a power utility model without probability weighting, it was vastly inferior to the mean-variance-skewness model (probability weighting model AIC: 3674, log Group Bayes factor MVS vs probability weighting=243). We also ﬁt a cumulative prospect theory (CPT) model, with the reference point set at the £1.20 sure amount rather than the status quo of £0. This allows for potential overweighting of small probability outcomes at both extremes of the distribution, similar to skewness preference. The MVS model outperformed the CPT model (log Group Bayes factor MVS vs CPT: 236; Supplementary Fig. 2).  We next used our winning MVS model to provide subject-speciﬁc preferences for variance and skewness. Parameter estimates from the MVS model showed that 16/23 subjects were averse to variance (average variance preference: −0.20; s.e.m. 0.07), and 15/23 were averse to positive skewness (average skewness preference: −0.09; s.e.m. 0.03) (Fig. 2B). Beta (temperature) values for the logistic function were low, indicating that choices were well partitioned by the linear model (average beta=0.14; s.e.m. 0.01). Some subjects had strong skewness preference but were insensitive to variance, other subjects were indifferent to skewness. 8/23 showed a negative variance and skewness parameter, which corresponds to a (locally) sigmoid utility function. There was a weak negative correlation between variance and skew-preference (r2 = 0.17; p = 0.05). No individuals in our sample were both variance and positive-skewseeking. The MVS model was at least as good as the MV and MS alternatives in the majority of individual cases, outperforming the MS model in 19/23 subjects and the MV model in 17/23 subjects.  It is possible that subjects might switch their behavioural preferences from preferring positive to preferring negative skewness over the course of the experiment. We checked this possibility by separately ﬁtting the MVS model per subject to the ﬁrst and second half of the data. We found no evidence that individuals reverse their preference for skewness during the experiment, with 15 subjects starting and ﬁnishing with preference for negative skewness, 5 subjects starting and ﬁnishing with preference for positive skewness, and only 3 subjects reversing preference from negative to positive skew seeking (20/23 subjects with no switch in preference, binomial test=n.s.). We explored this question further, and tested if there was any systematic shift in preference at all. There was no signiﬁcant change in the estimated variance preference parameters from the 1st to the 2nd half of the session across subjects (paired t-test, p=.75). However there was a change in skew-preference (paired t-test, p=0.005). Consequently, for the imaging analysis, we use individuals’ average behavioural preferences estimated across the experimental session. Note that any change in preference over time will  1144  M.

Functional imaging  Responses to variance and skewness  Having established that a MVS model best explained participants’ choice behaviour, we next asked whether statistical components of this model have a distinct neural representation. In line with our predictions, brain activity in right PPC (peak MNI coord: 32, −60, 50; p=0.003, cluster extent=1318 voxels) showed a signiﬁcant correlation with lottery variance on each trial, irrespective of choice (Figs. 3A and B, Supplementary Table 2). No brain activity negatively correlating with variance survived family-wise error-correction.  In contrast to a segregated representation of variance, we observed a distributed encoding of skewness. Using our pair of regressors representing stimulus-evoked BOLD activity modulated by the degree  (magnitude) of lottery skewness, for positive and negatively skewed trials respectively, we tested both whether there were regions encoding the full range of skewness on a linear scale, and whether there were regions whose activation depended solely on the degree of positive or negative skewness. No single area linearly correlated with the full range of skewness (i.e. both increasing activation for greater positive skewness, and decreasing activation for greater negative skewness), which we assessed by testing for a conjunction between activity for positive and negative skewness (at p b0.01 voxelwise threshold). Instead, we found dissociable cortical and subcortical regions individually correlating with positive and negative skewness. As positive skewness increased (a small chance of a better than average outcome) so too did BOLD signal in ventral striatum (peak voxel MNI coord: −10, 4, −14; p=0.033 (small volume corrected), cluster extent =228 voxels), and bilateral anterior insula extending into inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (on right: peak voxel MNI coord: 30, 16, −14; p =0.021 (small volume corrected), cluster extent=234 voxels. on left: peak voxel MNI coord: −40, 24, −16; p=0.017 (small  Fig. 3.

Thus, the more positive a subjects’ skew parameter (preference for positive over negative skewness) the stronger the correlation with skewness in this area (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 3). There was no signiﬁcant correlation surviving correction between behavioural preference and skewness-evoked activity in other regions. By contrast, the posterior parietal area correlating with variance did not express differential activity that co-varied with subject-speciﬁc variance preference (masked for voxels expressing variance-related activity, no signiﬁcant voxels at mask threshold 0.05 uncorrected).  Choice-related activity  Information about summary statistics informed individuals’ choices, hence we next asked whether activity in regions responsive to variance and skewness also correlated with choice. There was a signiﬁcant effect of choice (the choice regressor expressing the effect of gamble Nsure) within variance-sensitive PPC (peak voxel MNI coord: 26, −60, 54; p=0.008, cluster extent=547 voxels, small volume-corrected for variance-related areas of activity) (Fig. 5), in skew-sensitive ventral striatum (peak voxel MNI coord: −8, 4, −10; p=0.016, small volume-corrected for skewness-related areas of activity) and medial prefrontal region (peak voxel MNI coord: 6,44,18; p = 0.049, small-volume corrected for skewness-related areas of activity) (Supplementary Table 4). In addition to these areas, across the whole-brain, a network of regions showed greater BOLD signal for gamble than sure choices (Supplementary Table 5), including ventral striatum, prefrontal, occipital and bilateral posterior parietal cortex. No areas showed the opposite pattern (sure Ngamble signal).  If activation correlating with choice within risk-sensitive regions inﬂuences action selection, a strong expectation is that this choicecoupled neural activity should also be modulated by individual risk preferences. This provides an alternative mechanism for risk preferences to inﬂuence decisions, rather than only by altering neural sensitivity to the stimulus dimensions of variance and skewness. For example, in regions sensitive to variance one might predict an enhanced correlation of BOLD signal with choice (gamble Nsure) in more varianceaverse individuals. Within the variance-sensitive PPC region, we observed just such an effect (peak voxel MNI coord: 36, −58, 42; p=0.035, cluster extent=656 voxels). Thus, for subjects with strong variance aversion there was greater activity for a gamble choice than a sure choice (Figs. 6A and B). Clusters in right supplementary motor area (SMA), posterior cingulate, and occipital lobe also showed a similar relationship (Supplementary Table 6). Performing the same analysis for skewness revealed that left anterior insula and right mid-insula express a positive correlation between choice and skew-preference (peak voxel MNI coord: −24, 22, −6; p=0.033, small-volume corrected, cluster extent = 666 voxels) (Figs. 6C and D, Supplementary Table 7). Moreover, the same right insula region showing an interaction between choice-related activation and skew-preference also showed a positive  Fig. 5. Choice-related activity. Both ventral striatum and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) show signiﬁcantly greater BOLD signal for gamble versus sure choices (ventral striatum peak coord: −8, 4, −10; p =0.016, small-volume corrected; PPC peak coord: 26, −60, 54; p =0.008, small-volume corrected).

(Figs. 3C and 4, Supplementary Table 2), a priori regions of interest where riskrelated activity has been seen in previous studies (Schultz et al., 2008). In contrast, negative skewness correlated with activity in medial prefrontal cortex (peak voxel MNI coord: 4, 44, 36; p b0.001, cluster extent=1673 voxels) (Fig. 3E, Supplementary Table 2). There were no areas surviving correction that correlated with decreasing positive or decreasing negative skewness (i.e. greater BOLD signal for less skewed lotteries). Ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex expressed dissociated responses to positive and negative skewness (Figs. 3D and F). No areas correlated with increasing magnitude of skewness irrespective of sign (i.e. more active for skewed than symmetrical lotteries, irrespective of whether the outliers were better or worse than the average) survived correction.  Given that the MVS model speciﬁes value as a linear mixture of variance and skewness, we would expect that any regions expressing activity correlating with gamble utility would be expected to also show a partial correlation with both variance and skewness. Conversely, the fact that we do not see common regions correlating with variance and skewness would argue against a unitary representation of lottery value. However, this may be due to reduced detection power in an additive mixture of random variables, thus we also tested directly for a representation of value. We ran separate GLMs to identify regions correlating with the trial-by-trial utility of the lottery (stimulus value; MVS model), the difference in utility of lottery vs. sure amount (relative stimulus value), and utility of the chosen– utility of the unchosen option (relative action value). No areas correlated with stimulus value, even within regions of interest (variance and skew-sensitive areas, or prefrontal cortex) at an uncorrected (p b0.001) threshold. For relative stimulus value, we observed a 5-voxel cluster at uncorrected signiﬁcance (p b0.001, voxel level) in right ventromedial OFC. Relative action values were reﬂected in robust activation in a network of regions comprising bilateral precentral sulcus extending into supplementary motor area, and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (p b0.001, corrected). As might be expected, these regions form a typical motor/motor preparatory network (Cunnington et al., 2002).  Integration with variance and skewness preferences  We considered whether regions encoding the statistics of lottery outcomes also integrated this information with individuals’ tastes for risk. These variance or skewness-encoding regions could express different sensitivities to these statistics depending upon an individual's risk preferences. Thus we tested whether areas expressing variance and skewness-related activity altered in sensitivity (correlation effect size) to these statistics in a manner that correlated with subjects’ preferences, as estimated from the MVS model. In regions encoding either positive or negative skewness, we identiﬁed a signiﬁcant interaction between BOLD activity for positive skewness and subject-speciﬁc skew-preference  1146  M.

Discussion  We show that individuals’ choices are sensitive to both the spread (variance), and the shape and asymmetry of a distribution of possible outcomes (skewness). Moreover, these different risk dimensions have distinct neural representations, providing strong evidence that the brain adopts a ‘summary statistic’ approach to outcome evaluation (Rangel et al., 2008).  Our paradigm substantially differs from previous neuroeconomic approaches to risk, as we independently manipulate statistical features of a distribution of outcomes. Risk typically is approximated by variance (Christopoulos et al., 2009; McCoy and Platt, 2005; Preuschoff et al., 2006; Tobler et al., 2007). This neglects other psychologically salient features, such as small chances of much better (positive skewness) or worse (negative skewness) than average outcomes (Coombs, 1960; Harvey and Siddique, 2000; Jullien and Salanie, 2000). Contrasting with alternative risk-measures focusing only on the chance of poor outcomes (Bawa, 1975; Fishburn, 1984), we ﬁnd participants inﬂuenced by both negative and positive skewness in addition to variance.  Skewness-preference permits simultaneous ‘risk-aversion’ and ‘riskseeking’, inexplicable by variance-sensitivity alone (Garrett and Sobel, 1999). On average, our participants were both variance and positive skew-averse, disliking uncertainty (outcome dispersion) and preferring gambles with mostly above average rewards but risking a small chance of low payoffs. An example of negative skew preference would be to prefer property investment, with reasonable average yields but a small chance of heavy losses, to the opportunity of investing in oil exploration, with potentially high yields but a large probability of not recouping investment. In contrast with normative theoretical one's original  predictions of positive skew preference in variance averse individuals (Scott and Horvath, 1980), we ﬁnd relative negative skew preference and variance aversion (on average) in our sample of participants. However, in experiments where preferences for lotteries with different variance and skewness have been systematically examined, individuals in fact exhibit heterogeneous behaviour.  Several studies have reported predominantly positive skewseeking behaviour (Alderfer, 1970; Coombs and Pruitt, 1960), or used positive skew preference to explain gambling behaviour (Garrett and Sobel, 1999; Golec and Tamarkin, 1998). Other studies have reported varied preferences, with different participants showing positive or negative skew-seeking as is the case in our study (Lopes, 1984), or negative skew preference on average (Lichtenstein, 1965). Skewness has also been shown to inﬂuence perceived riskiness in different directions (Coombs and Bowen, 1971), and negative skewseeking investment behaviour is also common in investors (Taleb, 2004; Tan, 1991). Here we systematically examine these separate inﬂuences by experimental design, both showing that the overall shape of the outcome distribution drives choice and independently evokes neural activity. Together this supports the idea that ‘risk preference’ is not a unitary measure, either of behaviour or in terms of activity it is likely to evoke in the brain. While there are no clear biological restrictions on the range of preferences individuals are allowed to exhibit in a summary statistic framework, it is nonetheless interesting to speculate on the reasons why these studies report different preferences for variance and skewness. Distorted estimates of very small probabilities are likely to have an additional impact on choice, and some previous studies have used extremely unlikely events when demonstrating skew-preferences. Many previous studies also present mixed gambles (with both possible ﬁnancial losses and gains), rather than presenting decisions purely in the gain domain as in the current study. This raises the possibility that contextual frame (loss or gain) of the decision could additionally inﬂuence predilections for risk.  Consistent with our behavioural ﬁnding of sensitivity to different elements of risk, we also ﬁnd distributed risk representation in the  M. Symmonds et al. / NeuroImage 58 (2011) 1139–1149  1147  brain. Variance was linearly encoded in PPC, concurring with single unit and fMRI data showing enhanced PPC activity during risky decision making (Huettel et al., 2005; Mohr et al., 2010a; Platt and Glimcher, 1999). Parietal cortex represents numerical range (Piazza et al., 2007) and expresses an interaction between number and space (Hubbard et al., 2005), suggesting that variance representation in PPC reﬂects an intuitively spatial evocation of the spread of an outcome distribution. This may explain the absence of PPC activity when risk is varied by altering win probability, rather than manipulating the range of outcome amounts (Preuschoff et al., 2006). While possible that PPC expresses an effect consequent upon increasing risk, such as enhanced attention (Behrmann et al., 2004), we ﬁnd a speciﬁc effect for variance rather than skewness, despite both inﬂuencing risk perception.  Skewness-related activity in DMPFC, insula, and striatum encodes a dimension independent of variance, emphasising that risk is not synonymous with variance alone. Anterior insula and DMPFC are consistently implicated in risk-processing (Bach et al., 2009; Behrens et al., 2007; Christopoulos et al., 2009; Critchley et al., 2001; Engelmann and Tamir, 2009; Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005; Mohr et al., 2010b; Smith et al., 2009; St Onge and Floresco, 2009; Tobler et al., 2007), and ventral striatum manifests immediate and delayed responses to probability (Preuschoff et al., 2006) and reward magnitude (Knutson et al., 2005; Yacubian et al., 2007). These prior observations may have tapped into a combination of risk elements, while here we dissociate variance and skewness. Previously observed non-linear ventral striatum activation for probability (Hsu et al., 2009) could be explained by positive skewness encoding as these variables are correlated when binary outcomes are used. It is also possible that the converse is true, although less likely given that we employ multiple outcomes. Moreover, there is no clear model of how multiple outcomes would be encoded, indeed one might expect neural representation of both ‘win’ and ‘loss’ outcomes assuming separate encoding of amounts and probabilities. While agnostic as to the exact coding of the summary statistics of outcome distributions (e.g. variance, standard deviation and coefﬁcient of variation are correlated measures of spread), critically we ﬁnd responses to dispersion versus asymmetry of outcomes evokes activity in anatomically separate networks.  We identify responses to positive skewness in ventral striatum, anterior insula, and IFG, but to negative skewness in DMPFC. This distinction parallels related ﬁndings that DMPFC encodes the probability of loss (Smith et al., 2009; Xue et al., 2010) and could explain why studies do not report risk-correlation in ventral striatum when skewness is controlled (Christopoulos et al., 2009; Tobler et al., 2009). Consistent with our data, PPC insula and DMPFC activation was also reported in a study with choices between multiple-outcome lotteries (Venkatraman et al., 2009), potentially reﬂecting preferences for different kinds of outcome distribution. Our ﬁnding of separable anatomic regions correlating with positive and negative skewness does not predict that subjects would have distinct attitudes toward positive and negative skewness. While this is a plausible prediction we ﬁnd no evidence for a separate expression of preference in these regions. The skewness parameter from the MVS model reﬂects how much subjects value positive relative to negative skewness in a gamble. Given that we can approximate subjects’ behaviour with a single skew parameter, it is equally likely that skew-preference arises from an interaction between brain areas. In order for the MVpSnS model to win (in terms of predicting choice), our participants would need to have very different sensitivities for positive and negative skewness, or express skewness intransitivities such as liking symmetric above any skewed gambles. We acknowledge that it is possible that within a larger behavioural sample we would have sufﬁcient data to demonstrate such different sensitivities for positive and negative skewness.  A recent paper (Wu et al., 2011) has also examined skewness, investigating neural responses to the presentation of 4 repeatedly presented mixed gambles (high variance, low variance, positively  skewed, negatively skewed) in a passive viewing (no choice) paradigm. In line with our present ﬁndings, they report greater ventral striatal activity for positive versus negatively skewed gambles and anterior insula sensitivity to skewness. There are several important differences and limitations in the aformentioned study compared to the present experiment. Critically, our subjects made active choices allowing a distinction between processes supporting risk quantiﬁcation and evaluation from choice. We did not present outcomes of gambles on each trial, thus could outrule feedbackrelated activity. In addition, we employ an orthogonal parametric design presenting a range of gambles with different variance and skewness, avoiding a potential confound between skewness and high variance and the limitation of using solely 4 stimuli in a cognitive paradigm. These design features enables us to accurately and independently measure behavioural and neural sensitivity to each risk dimension. Interestingly, Wu at al elicited ratings of arousal, perceived risk and preference for each of the 4 lotteries and found that these ratings are not commensurate, highlighting a disparity between the gambles that subjects preferred and gambles that evoked an affective response. Despite preferences in their sample being very different from our present participants, there is a similarity in neural responses, with anterior insula being active for positively skewed gambles in our negative-skew preferring subjects, whereas it was most active for skewed versus symmetric gambles in Wu's study where subjects exhibit converse preferences.  Medial PFC and striatum are reciprocally connected (Croxson et al., 2005; Sesack et al., 1989), project to prefrontal and pre-motor areas involved in action planning and execution (Haber, 2003), and insular cortex (Guldin and Markowitsch, 1983; Shi and Cassell, 1998). These connections can mediate information transmission between areas translating different features of the outcome distribution into summary statistics, and areas integrating this information with context and individual risk preferences. This distributed network for risk evaluation echoes distributed neural processing in vision, where discrete visual dimensions (colour, motion, form), are processed in segregated networks (Courtney and Ungerleider, 1997).  Anterior insula and IFG activity is modulated by individual taste for risk, expressing greater activity for positively skewed gambles when individuals prefer positive skewness, and showing a correlation with choice also dependent upon individual skewness and variancepreference. This supports the idea of these areas evaluating risk and subsequently promoting or inhibiting risk-taking (Christopoulos et al., 2009; Engelmann and Tamir, 2009; Paulus et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2010). The insula is suited to perform such integration, central in representing interoceptive states consequent upon perception of risk (Craig, 2009; Singer et al., 2009), with motoric basal ganglia and premotor projections, and to value-comparison regions in orbitofrontal cortex (Augustine, 1996; FitzGerald et al., 2009; Plassmann et al., 2007). We observed greater loading for skewness than variance in anterior insula, generated by a range of skewness-preference in our subjects, as opposed to previous studies where skewness was ﬁxed (Christopoulos et al., 2009; Tobler et al., 2009). We also decorrelated choice from risk, whereas previous studies may have detected risk anticipation contingent on choice rather than the process of quantifying decision statistics (Christopoulos et al., 2009; Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005; Preuschoff et al., 2006; Tobler et al., 2009; Xue et al., 2010). Anticipation of chosen risk could recruit insula activity, explaining consistent reports of (risk-attitude dependent) activity in this region.  PPC and ventral striatum activity also correlated with choice, with the strength of correlation in PPC dependent upon the degree of variance-aversion, corroborating previous ﬁndings (Weber and Huettel, 2008). Striatum responded to both positive skewness and gamble choice, although subjects mostly avoided positively skewed gambles. One possibility here is that striatum could encode statistical properties of a gamble and independently engender action following  1148  M. Symmonds et al. / NeuroImage 58 (2011) 1139–1149  integration of risk preferences and statistical information. Note that variance preferences are also signiﬁcant in driving choice, hence could also inﬂuence striatal activity. Alternatively, striatum could exert a negative inﬂuence on the choice to gamble. The pattern of activity we observed in PPC would be expected in a region inhibiting risky choice, as the strongest coupling occurs in variance-averse individuals. This region overlaps the medial integral to motor intention (Andersen and Cui, 2009; Grefkes et al., 2004), thus parietal cortex might promote safe choices via polysynaptic links to basal ganglia and premotor regions (Clower et al., 2005; Tanne-Gariepy et al., 2002). The PPC has direct insula connections (Cavada and Goldman-Rakic, 1989), thus may also directly pass quantitative information about variance to anterior insula.  intraparietal area,  It is interesting that a network of brain regions demonstrates greater activation for a gamble than a sure choice, as has been reported in previous studies (Christopoulos et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2004; Weber and Huettel, 2008). This indicates that recruitment of neural regions is different when generating gamble versus sure choices. This is contrasts with the simplifying assumption portrayed in our behavioural models, where the process of choice is modelled as a softmax comparison between equally-weighted utilities for the lottery and sure amount. While we make no assumptions here about the neural processes underlying choice generation, similar differential activation in striatum has been related to the acceptance or rejection of a default action (Yu et al., 2010) and in prefrontal cortex during the selection of ‘exploratory’ actions (Daw et al., 2006).  In this study, we consider two plausible ways in which individual preferences could modulate neural activity. We ﬁrst ﬁnd preferences modulating stimulus-evoked activity, with individuals with stronger preference for skewness demonstrating increased insula sensitivity to skewness. Secondly, we show variance and skewness preferences modulate action-related neural activation, as individuals with stronger preferences have greater coupling between neural activity and choice within risk-sensitive regions. Overall, this provides evidence that preferences modulate both stimulus-evoked and choice-related activity.  Conclusion  Classical utility theory assumes values are assigned to possible states of the world, then weighted by probability (Machina, 2005). We provide evidence for an alternative hypothesis, that the brain is adapted to decompose decisions into summary statistics reﬂecting dispersion and asymmetry of outcome distributions. Compartmentalizing independent stimulus properties to deconstruct neural networks supporting perception is well established in sensory neuroscience. Similarly, we ﬁnd that contrary to common assumption, risk is not monolithic but can be decomposed into separate dimensions which have segregated representations in the brain. Strikingly, neural activity in risky choice also reﬂects individuals’ tastes for different features of an outcome distribution, an evaluation and integration supported by dissociable neural regions involved in risk processing.

Nine phobic and 10 non-phobic subjects participated in an fMRI study in which they were presented with disorder-relevant, generally disgust-inducing, generally fear-evoking and neutral pictures. We observed diminished medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activity in patients compared to controls for phobia-relevant and disgust-inducing pictures. The MPFC has been shown to be critically involved in the automatic and effortful cognitive regulation of emotions. Therefore, the results might reﬂect reduced cognitive control of emotions in BII phobics during the experience of phobic symptoms as well as during states of disgust. The latter response component might be a result of the elevated disgust sensitivity of BII phobics. # 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction  Blood-injection-injury (BII) phobia is an atypical speciﬁc phobia that strongly affects patients’ daily lives. The sufferers often experience emotional fainting (vasovagal syncope) when exposed to phobic stimuli such as blood, injections or injuries (APA, 1994). This physiological response is at ﬁrst sympathetically dominated, as seen in other speciﬁc phobias (e.g. spider phobia), but is then followed by a pronounced parasympathetic component (Page, 1994). The phobics display excessive fear reactions and avoidance behavior. Moreover, it has been shown that not only fear, but the emotion disgust, plays a major role in this disorder as well. Questionnaire studies and picture perception experiments have shown positive associations between blood-related fears and disgust reactivity (e.g. Tolin et al., 1997; deJong and Merkelbach, 1998; Schienle et al., 2003). To our knowledge there is only one published fMRI study on BII phobia (Schienle et al., 2003). This investigation addressed the elevated disgust sensitivity of this patient group by analyzing  * Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 641 99 26338; fax: +49 641 99 26099.

The only ascertainable difference between BII phobics and healthy controls was a heightened activity in the visual association cortex. A shortcoming of this study was the lack of a phobiarelevant condition. The goal of another fMRI investigation (Wright et al., 2004) was to determine if two types of disgustrelevant stimuli, pictures depicting mutilation or contamination, were able to provoke similar or differential hemodynamic responses in healthy subjects. The ﬁndings indicated that the insula was crucial for the processing of both disgust stimuli, whereas pictures of mutilation speciﬁcally activated the superior parietal cortex. The results could not be replicated in a similar experiment (Schienle et al., 2006). In this case, a comparable activation pattern including the occipitotemporal cortex, the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex occurred in both disgust conditions. Mutilation scenes triggered greater activity in inferior parietal cortex regions as compared to contamination scenes.  Neuroimaging studies focusing on other anxiety disorders besides BII phobia have often found increased activity in regions involved in the automatic processing of fear stimuli such as the amygdala, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the insula, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and motor-related regions, e.g. the supplementary motor area (Lorberbaum et al.,  A. Hermann et al. / Biological Psychology 75 (2007) 124–130  125  2004; Schienle et al., 2005; Kim and Gorman, 2005). Also, a decreased activation in prefrontal cortex regions has frequently been observed (Kim and Gorman, 2005). The latter component might reﬂect a deﬁcit in cognitive control during excessive states of anxiety. This could possibly lead to reduced inhibitory regulation of limbic regions such as the amygdala. Especially, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the ACC are assumed to have speciﬁc functions in cognitive and self-referential processing as well as in emotion modulation (Phan et al., 2004). Taking this into account, it is likely that abnormal activity in MPFC areas might be an important characteristic of anxiety disorders (LeDoux, 2002). Furthermore, neuroimaging studies on cognitive regulation of emotions in healthy subjects have shown that these prefrontal areas are involved in different kinds of cognitive control of emotions, for instance reappraisal, anticipation and attention distraction (Ochsner and Gross, 2005).  The main goal of the present study was to identify the neural correlates of phobic states in BII phobics. We hypothesized that the presentation of blood-related pictures would activate regions important for the automatic processing of emotions (e.g. the amygdala). This should apply to both patients and non-phobic control subjects due to the overall emotional relevance of this stimulus type. The activation, however, should be greater in patients than controls. Further, the smaller capacity of phobics to cognitively regulate affective responses during the exposure should be mirrored in a reduced activation of prefrontal cortex regions relative to controls. Moreover, we hypothesized that phobic compared to healthy subjects would show an elevated disgust sensitivity and stronger hemodynamic responses towards disgust-inducing disorder-irrelevant pictures (e.g. in the amygdala). A fear condition with threatening, but non-phobic pictures served as a further emotional control condition.  2. Materials and methods  The participants of this study consisted of 9 female patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BII phobia (mean age = 22.9 years; S.D. = 4.7) and 10 non-phobic female control subjects (mean age = 27.6 years; S.D. = 10.7), who gave written informed consent for the study after the experiment had been explained to them. All participants denied taking any medication. The control subjects received 20 Euros for their participation. The patients underwent an exposure therapy after the experiment. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the German Society for Psychology.  The study consisted of two separate sessions. In the ﬁrst session the participants were interviewed with the short form of the clinical interview for DSM-IV (Margraf et al., 1991) to ensure the diagnosis and exclude individuals with comorbidities. A behavior test was conducted, where the subjects were asked to undergo a blood draw. All control subjects and none of the patients were able to perform this test. Afterwards, the participants completed the Mutilation Questionnaire (MQ, Klorman et al., 1974), the Blood Injection Symptom Scale (BISS, Page et al., 1997), the Questionnaire for the Assessment of Disgust Sensitivity (QADS, Schienle et al., 2002b), the trait scale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, Laux et al., 1981) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Hautzinger et al., 1993).  The fMRI study was conducted in the second session (approximately 1 week later). After the scanning, the subjects gave disgust, fear, valence and arousal ratings for each picture category (possible range: 1–9; ‘9’ indicated that the subject felt disgusted, anxious, pleasant and aroused). The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM; Bradley and Lang, 1994) was used for the valence and arousal ratings. The intensity of experienced disgust and fear was rated on 9-point Likert scales (1 = ‘not at all’; 9 = ‘very strong’), which had been developed by the authors.  The stimulus material consisted of four categories with 160 pictures in total: 40 phobic, 40 disgust, 40 fear and 40 neutral pictures. These stimuli were selected from the IAPS (Lang et al., 1997) and another picture set (Schienle et al., 2002a). The phobia-relevant scenes depicted, e.g. blood draws and wounds. The disgust-evoking pictures represented the domains poor hygiene (e.g. garbage piles, dirty toilets), animals (e.g. maggots, snails), body products (e.g. excrements, vomit) and unusual food (e.g. a man eating a grasshopper). Pictures showing attacks by humans (e.g. with pistols or knives) and animals (e.g. lions, sharks) formed the fear category, whereas the affectively neutral scenes consisted of, e.g. geometric ﬁgures and household articles. The pictures were presented for 1.5 s in blocks of 40 pictures of the same category. The pictures sequence in each block was randomized and each block was shown six times during the experiment. Two categories of the same type were not allowed to follow each other. Participants viewed the pictures by a mirror ﬁxed on the head coil (visual ﬁeld = 188). The complete experiment took 24 min.  A total of 492 volumes (T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging sequence with 30 slices covering the whole brain, slice thickness = 5 mm, no gap, interleaved, TA = 100 ms, TE = 60 ms, TR = 3000 ms, ﬂip angle = 908, ﬁeld of view = 192 mm  192 mm, matrix size = 64  64) were acquired with a 1.5 T whole-body tomograph (Siemens Symphony, Erlangen, Germany; standard head coil). The axial slices were oriented parallel to the AC-PC line. To control for saturation effects the ﬁrst six volumes were discarded. The statistical parametric mapping software package (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London) implemented in Matlab (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA, release 12) was used for the preprocessing and statistical analyses. Slice time correction, realignment and normalization to the standard space of the Montreal Neurological Institute brain and the smoothing procedure (isotropic three-dimensional Gaussian ﬁlter with a full width at half maximum of 9 mm) were carried out. Each experimental condition was modeled by a boxcar function convolved with a hemodynamic response function in the GLM. The six movement parameters of the rigid body transformation were introduced in the model as covariates. Serial correlations were controlled by an AR(1) process and the high pass ﬁlter was set at 512 s. In the ﬁrst level analyses the following contrasts were calculated for each subject: Phobia > Neutral, Disgust > Neutral, Fear > Neutral, Fear > Disgust, Disgust > Fear, Phobia > Fear, Fear > PhoPhobia, Phobia > Disgust and Disgust > Phobia. Then, the contrast images were used in second level random effects analyses. We conducted one-sample t-tests for each group and two-sample t-tests to explore differences between the phobic and the control group. We computed voxel intensity tests (intensity threshold: p = 0.01 uncorrected) for the whole brain volume (exploratory analyses) and for regions of interest (ROI). Error probabilities ( p) were corrected for multiple comparisons using the random ﬁeld theory. When exploratory analyses were conducted, p was corrected for the whole brain volume, when a ROI test was used p was corrected for the speciﬁc volume of interest according to the tested hypothesis. The signiﬁcance level was always set to alpha = 0.05. The following ROIs had been selected on the basis of previous ﬁndings on anxiety disorders and the neural processing of mutilation stimuli: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), hippocampus, insula, lateral orbital prefrontal cortex (LOFC), supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior parietal cortex, superior parietal cortex, thalamus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). The ROIs had been deﬁned by the anatomical parcellation of the normalized brain (single-subject high-resolution T1 volume of the Montreal Neurological Institute). We created masks based on this assignment between anatomical structures and voxel coordinates (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002).  3. Results  3.1.

Hermann et al. / Biological Psychology 75 (2007) 124–130  a detailed visual inspection of the pictures as these parietal areas are involved in attention processes (Behrmann et al., 2004).  More activity in phobics than controls was seen in the SMA, which is an important region for the preparation of movement. This response might be linked to intended avoidance behavior in BII-phobic subjects. However, diminished dorso- and ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity seems to be the main characteristic that distinguishes the hemodynamic responses towards phobic versus neutral pictures of BII phobics from those of non-phobic control subjects. These regions have been shown to be critically involved in the cognitive regulation of emotions (Ochsner and Gross, 2005). It can be assumed that this mechanism is impaired in patients suffering from BII phobia. Therefore, those individuals might experience signiﬁcantly stronger feelings of fear, disgust, arousal and unpleasantness in response to phobic objects as seen in their subjective stimulus ratings.  There were two distinct clusters of diminished activity in the PFC that are possibly related to different processes of cognitive emotion regulation. The ventral parts belong to a system that is important for the identiﬁcation of the emotional signiﬁcance of stimuli, the production of affective states and the automatic regulation of autonomic responses (Phillips et al., 2003). A more dorsal system including the DMPFC and the DLPFC is found to be concerned with effortful regulation of affective states (Phillips et al., 2003; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). Together with the ventral system, the dorsal PFC is activated by processes such as reappraisal and anticipation (Ochsner and Gross, 2005). This goes along with the inhibition of limbic regions such as the amygdala, which is important for the processing of emotional stimuli and the production of affective states (Phelps, 2006). Disturbances of both mechanisms (automatic and controlled regulation of emotions) might be related to the maladaptive emotional responses in BII phobics during exposure. Diminished activity in the VMPFC was also observed for the contrast Phobia > Fear in the patient group. Furthermore, between-group comparison for Phobia > Fear revealed marginally signiﬁcant stronger activity in the DMPFC and VMPFC in controls than phobics. This ﬁnding points to the relevance of altered MPFC responses to phobic stimuli even when being compared with other threatening stimuli.  Beyond this, there is evidence for altered MPFC reactivity in other anxiety disorders. Diminished neuronal activation has been shown in patients afﬂicted with post-traumatic stress disorder (Shin et al., 2005) and generalized social phobia (Lorberbaum et al., 2004). Moreover, there are PET studies on spider phobia which indicated reduced activity in prefrontal areas in response to phobic objects (Fredrikson et al., 1995; Johanson et al., 1998), especially when the patients experienced panic symptoms and had no effective coping strategies on hand (Johanson et al., 1998). Even in depressed relative to healthy subjects decreased activity in the VMPFC towards sad facial expressions in combination with congruent autobiographical memory has been observed (Keedwell et al., 2005).  The reduced activity in ventromedial PFC regions in BII phobics relative to controls was not restricted to disorder-relevant  Fig. 1.

Furthermore, controls showed marginally greater activation than phobics in the right DMPFC (MNI: 9, 57, 27; k = 45; t = 4.30; p = 0.058) and in the left VMPFC (MNI:  6, 48,  12; k = 141; t = 3.97; p = 0.071) for Phobia > Fear. Both groups were characterized by comparable activation for Fear > Neutral.  4. Discussion  This is the ﬁrst study to investigate the neural correlates of phobic states in patients suffering from BII phobia. As expected, the viewing of disorder-speciﬁc relative to affectively neutral scenes provoked increased activity in emotionrelevant brain structures in the patient group (i.e. thalamus and hippocampus; Kim and Gorman, 2005; Phillips et al., 2003). The phobics were further characterized by marginally signiﬁcant amygdala activation ( p = 0.054), which was also in the control subjects ( p = 0.073). Interestingly, present phobics and controls did not differ in their amygdala responses, which points to the overall emotional signiﬁcance of stimuli involving blood and injury, as well as to the central role of the amygdala for the decoding of threat (LeDoux, 2002). The control subjects showed activity in the visual association cortex, the thalamus and the LOFC when looking at blood relative to neutral pictures. The LOFC has been conceptualized as being important for the evaluation of the punishment value of emotional stimuli and the alteration of ongoing behavior (Kringelbach and Rolls, 2004). The controls also displayed signiﬁcant activation of the parietal cortex, which might reﬂect  A. Hermann et al. / Biological Psychology 75 (2007) 124–130  129  stimuli, but was also present in the disgust condition (Disgust > Neutral). Here, phobics further exhibited enhanced DLPFC activation; however, they did not deviate in the DMPFC involvement from controls. This response pattern might be due to a deﬁcit in the automatic, as opposed to the effortful regulation of disgust experiences in phobics. Their elevated disgust sensitivity could be associated with their reduced automatic control over disgust reactions leading to stronger feelings of disgust, fear and arousal towards these stimuli.  It is important to note that phobic compared to healthy individuals did not generally show reduced activity in the VMPFC in response to emotional material. These two groups were characterized by comparable brain activation for the contrast Fear > Neutral. Also, both groups had comparable trait anxiety scores and gave similar affective ratings for the fear stimuli. All in all, this ﬁnding seems to imply that the blood-phobic patients did not have a general fear disposition. Yet, they displayed signiﬁcant amygdala activation for the contrast Fear > Neutral, which was not present in control subjects. Thus, there might be a small group difference in the reactivity of the central fear network, which could not be detected due to the small sample sizes limiting statistical power. There are two further limitations that need to be acknowledged and addressed regarding the present study. The ﬁrst of which is the concern that the majority of neutral scenes depicted objects, whereas the affective pictures mainly showed human beings and animals. The fact that the picture type and the inclusion of living versus non-living-stimuli were not independent from each other could have contributed to the observed neural activation pattern as pointed out by one reviewer. It seems however unlikely that the most important ﬁnding, the MPFC deactivation, was due to this confound, since it was also present when comparing the phobic with the fear category, which both included human beings. A further limitation of our study is that only female subjects were measured. This had been done in order to control for genderrelated differences in disgust sensitivity. Nevertheless, it remains open if the described fMRI responses would also be detectable in male phobics.  In summary, BII phobics relative to controls were characterized by an elevated overall disgust but not fear sensitivity in addition to their phobic symptoms. On the neural level this was mirrored by reduced activation of the VMPFC in response to phobic and disgust but not to fear pictures. Finally, phobics displayed diminished VMPFC activity for the contrasts Phobia > Fear and Disgust > Fear but not for Phobia > Disgust. This provides further support for the role of this region in the enhancement of emotional reactions due to reduced cognitive control.  5. Conclusions  This is the ﬁrst fMRI study on symptom provocation in BII phobia. We observed decreased activation in medial prefrontal cortex areas towards phobic pictures in phobic compared to control subjects. Since this brain region is critically involved in the cognitive regulation of emotions, we assume that BII phobia  is characterized by a disturbance of this mechanism during exposure. Furthermore, BII phobics showed reduced activity in the VMPFC in response to generally disgust-inducing pictures, which might be related to their elevated disgust sensitivity. Future studies on BII phobia in particular and anxiety disorders in general should focus on a more detailed analysis of possible deﬁcits in the cognitive regulation of emotions.

A more complex, but ecologically more common, context is when multiple risky options are evaluated together. However, it is unknown whether encoding related to option evaluation in these situations involves similar principles. Here we employed fMRI during a task that parametrically manipulated EV and risk in two simultaneously presented lotteries, both of which contained either gains or losses. We found representations of EV in medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, an encoding that was dependent on which option was chosen (i.e. chosen and unchosen EV) and whether the choice was over gains or losses. Parietal activity reﬂected whether the riskier or surer option was selected, whilst activity in a network of regions that also included parietal cortex reﬂected both combined risk and difference in risk for the two options. Our ﬁndings provide support for the idea that summary statistics underpin a representation of value-based stimuli, and further that these summary statistics undergo distinct forms of encoding.

For example, animals have to choose between foraging in higher or lower risk patches, or humans whether to invest in higher or lower risk stocks. Such value-based decision-making can be considered within a biologically-grounded, process-based account where a choice evolves from option-evaluation through to action-selection (Corrado et al., 2009). Regarding option-evaluation, recent studies examining the neural basis of risky economic choice have suggested two competing accounts, one that involves a neural representation of outcome distributions by “summary statistics”, such as expected value (EV) and risk (Bossaerts, 2010; Preuschoff et al., 2006; Wright et al., 2012), and another in which subjective value (SV) is determined by the shape of a utility function, with risk-preference emerging as a by-product of that shape (Rangel et al., 2008). Here we seek new evidence for encoding of “summary statistics”, speciﬁcally investigating the unknown question of how the summary statistics of multiple, simultaneously evaluated, risky options may be encoded.  We used a task where each trial subject was simultaneously presented with two risky options, one of which had to be selected.  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, 12 Queen Square,  London WC1N 3BG, UK.

Unlike in a single option, with multiple options there are different ways in which EV and risk may be represented. For both risk and EV we ask whether encoding depends on which option is chosen (i.e. chosen and unchosen EVs; chosen and unchosen risks) or alternatively whether encoding is determined directly by the presented stimuli (e.g. sum or difference in EV or risks). Furthermore, as choices are inﬂuenced by whether potential outcomes entail gains or losses (i.e. their valence) (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) we also asked whether outcome valence differentially affects encoding of EV and risk.  However, even if option-evaluation involved such summary statistics, this does not address how risk, EV or valence inﬂuence action-selection. Thus, as a second aim we investigated the choice process from the perspective of a choice architecture in which multiple interacting systems inﬂuence action-selection (Dayan, 2008). In model-based systems, stimulus features such as EV, risk or valence may be incorporated within a uniﬁed subjective value (SV; utility) computed for each option and where action-selection involves choosing the option with the highest SV. Neurally, we test for encoding of SV. In contrast, in model-free systems that invoke approach–avoidance processes, a key feature is a contingency between stimulus properties and responsive action (i.e. to approach appetitive and to avoid aversive stimulus properties). For both risk and valence we previously found neural and reaction time (RT) data reﬂecting such contingencies in a task where choices involved a single risky option (Wright et al., 2012), and here asked whether these would be similarly expressed with multiple risky options. A further possibility, in line with choice resulting from multiple interacting systems, would be evidence relating to both: with model-based summary  432  N.D. Wright et al. / NeuroImage 81 (2013) 431–440  statistic encoding that may inﬂuence action-selection through comparator processes and/or approach–avoidance; as well as approach– avoidance to stimulus properties such as valence not requiring modelbased processing.  Here we examined the neural basis of risky choice in a task where each trial subjects had to select between two simultaneously presented risky options. Regarding option-evaluation, we hypothesised that there would be encoding of summary statistics representing these options; and were agnostic as to whether these would depend on which option is chosen, or alternatively whether encoding is determined directly by the presented stimuli. Regarding action-selection, we tested for evidence of uniﬁed SVs in addition to summary statistics, and for contingencies consistent with approach–avoidance processes.  Methods  Participants  All participants, recruited through institutional mailing lists, were healthy and provided informed consent. 25 right-handed participants took part (age mean 24 years, range 19–36; 15 male), with one further participant excluded due to artefacts during fMRI data acquisition. None had taken part in our previous experiments with related tasks (Wright et al., 2012). The University College London Ethics Committee approved the study.  Task  The Selection task (Fig. 1) was identical to that used behaviourally in Wright et al. (2012) except that all amounts were doubled for fMRI scanning. There were 200 trials presented in a random order, of which 100 were “gain trials” (all possible outcomes ≥0) and 100 were “loss trials” (all outcomes ≤0). In each trial, individuals evaluated two lotteries and selected between them. Each trial began with a ﬁxation cross presented for 1–2 s (mean 1.5 s), followed by viewing the options for 4020 ms; and ﬁnally a black square appeared to indicate participants had 1500 ms to input their choice by button press (the black square turned white when they chose). If participants did not respond, they received £0 on a “gain trial” and the maximum loss possible on a “loss trial” (£-24).  Our decision-variables of interest were EV, risk and valence. We generated a set of 100 “gain trials” (Fig. 1b and see below), in which we parametrically and orthogonally manipulated the difference in risk (10 levels of variance) and EV (10 levels) between two lotteries (each with two possible outcomes, all ≥0), giving ﬁve levels of absolute difference for risk and EV (these absolute differences henceforth denoted by ΔVar and ΔEV). To manipulate valence, we simply multiplied all amounts by −1 to give 100 “loss trials”. This created a set of “gain trials” and a set of “loss trials” that were perfectly matched in their parametric modulations of risk and EV.  Participants began the day with an endowment of £24. After the experiment, one “gain trial” and one “loss trial” were picked at random and their outcomes were added to the endowment to determine ﬁnal participant payment. Participants could receive between £0–48. There was a low proportion of non-responses (4% ± s.d. 3% of trials). The mean payment received was £23 (range £4–£42).  Stimulus set  We used the same set of 100 “gain trials” as in Wright et al. (2012) but with all amounts doubled (Fig. 1b). We created this stimulus set in two stages. First, we generated a list of every possible trial within the following constraints: each trial consisted of two pie charts each with two segments; outcomes were between £0 and £24; the smallest allowable probability was 0.1; and the smallest allowable probability increment was 0.05. Second, from within this very large number of potential trials, we selected our set of 100 trials that were the closest match to our desired levels of difference in Var and EV between stimuli. The difference in EV and variance between the options was up to a maximum ΔEV of 3.8 and maximum ΔVar of 73.  For a given lottery with N potential outcomes (m1, m2, … mN), with probabilities p = p1, p2, … pN, we deﬁne the EV and variance (Var) of the outcome distribution as follows:  mnpn  EV ¼ XN n¼1 Var ¼ XN n¼1  ð mn−EV  Þ2pn:  ð1Þ  ð2Þ  Fig. 1. Manipulating risk, expected value and valence. a) In each “gain trial” individuals were presented with two lotteries (each with 2 possible outcomes, both ≥0) to consider and select between. They viewed the options for 4 s, after which a black square appeared centrally and they had 1.5 s to input their choice by left or right button press. b) We created set of 100 “gain trials” in which we parametrically and orthogonally manipulated the difference in risk (deﬁned as outcome variance; 10 levels) and EV (10 levels) between the lotteries (i.e. ﬁve levels of absolute difference for risk and EV, with these absolute differences used in our analyses). For illustration here we plot each metric for the right minus the left lottery (rt–lt). c) Multiplying all “gain trial” amounts by −1 gave 100 “loss trials” with identical parametric manipulations. All 200 trials were presented in random order.  N.D. Wright et al. / NeuroImage 81 (2013) 431–440  433  Statistical analysis  In our behavioural analyses, statistical tests were carried out using paired or independent-samples t-tests, or mixed analyses of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS 17.0 or 20; reported P-values are two-tailed.  Reaction time analysis  We normalised each individual's RTs by taking the natural logarithm, mean-correcting and dividing by the standard deviation. However, we note that our ﬁndings were the same irrespective of having used “raw” or normalised RTs. Regression analysis on participants' RT data was conducted using the glmﬁt function in Matlab.  Behavioural modelling  We assessed different utility functions that were identical to those used previously (Wright et al., 2012). We ﬁt data on an individual participant basis. We modelled behaviour by estimating model parameters using maximum likelihood analysis implemented in Matlab. We compared models with different utility functions using Group Bayes Factors, with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) penalising model complexity (Schwarz, 1978). To pre-empt our results we ﬁnd the same winning model (Mean–Variance–Valence model) as in our previous datasets.  In all our models, on each trial the subjective values, or utilities (U), of both options were computed using one of the utility functions below. These values were then compared to generate a trial-by-trial probability of each choice, using a softmax function with a free parameter β (constrained between 0 and 10) that allows for noise in action selection.  Initially, we compared three models to ask if behaviour was biassed by risk and valence. First, in a very simple Mean-Only model (U = EV), individuals only cared about the mean of the options. Second, we asked if choice was also biassed by risk, using a Mean– variance model (U = EV + Var ∗ ρ), where risk is measured as variance and ρ is a free parameter reﬂecting an individual's preference for variance (a risk-neutral individual has ρ = 0, risk-averse ρ b 0, and risk-seeking ρ > 0). Third, we asked if both risk and valence bias choice, using a Mean–variance–valence model in which there is a ρgain parameter that reﬂects risk preference in gain trials and a ρloss parameter reﬂecting risk preference in loss trials. We also implemented an Expected Utility model (EUT), Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory models, all of which are described in detail in Wright et al. (2012).  fMRI data acquisition  This was identical to that previously reported in Wright et al. (2012). In a 3 T Allegra scanner (Siemens) each participant underwent one functional run (515 volumes), acquired using a gradient-echo EPI sequence (46 transverse slices; TR, 2.76 s; TE, 30 ms; 3 × 3 mm in-plane resolution; 2 mm slice thickness; 1 mm gap between adjacent slices; z-shim −0.4 mT/m; positive phase encoding direction; slice tilt −30°) optimised for OFC and amygdala. We acquired a T1-weighted anatomical scan and local ﬁeld maps.  fMRI data analysis  Functional data were analysed using standard procedures in SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping; www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). fMRI time-series were regressed onto a composite general linear model (GLM). The GLM contained boxcars for the length of time the lotteries were displayed (5.5 s) to examine the decision-making process. Delta functions were also included for button presses, lottery onset to account for visual stimulus presentation, and for trials in which subjects  failed to respond. In our main GLM, we modelled our neuroimaging data using a 2 valence (gain, loss) by 2 choice (riskier, surer) design. Additional parametric modulators were included, with the height of the boxcar modulated by ΔEV and ΔVariance in each trial. The delta functions and boxcars were convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function. Movement regressors were included in the GLM. This main GLM design was identical to that used previously in Wright et al. (2012).  We report all activations at P b 0.05 that survive whole brain correction using family-wise error at the cluster level (Friston et al., 1993), unless otherwise stated. Clusters were deﬁned using a threshold of P b 0.005. For presentation, images are displayed at P b 0.001 uncorrected. Unless otherwise stated, small volume correction (P b 0.05) was for a sphere of 10 mm radius around stated coordinates.  Alternative parametric designs  We also estimated further GLMs using alternative parametric regressors, described in the Results. Unlike in the basic GLM speciﬁed above in which ΔEV and ΔVariance were orthogonal by design, due to a limit in the number of trials this was not possible for all other parametric regressors and there were correlations between some regressors (Table 1). Note that similar correlations for choice-dependent regressors (e.g. chosen SV or unchosen SV) will be contingent on individual participants' choices. Unless otherwise stated, all these models with alternative parametric regressors were based on the same 2 valence (gain, loss) by 2 choice (riskier, surer) design with the same regressors of no interest (e.g. button press). Further, unless otherwise stated all were estimated without orthogonalisation, which enables us to examine only neural activity that correlates with the unique component of each regressor.  Results  Choice behaviour  In our Selection task both risk and valence inﬂuenced choice, replicating our previous ﬁndings (Wright et al., 2012). With respect to risk, a simple metric of risk preference is given by the proportion of riskier choices made overall (PropRisk; risk-neutral = 0.5; risk-averse b0.5; risk-seeking >0.5). Here, in the Selection task individuals were risk-averse (PropRiskall 0.40 ± s.d. 0.12; one-sample t-test versus risk-neutral, t(24) = −3.94, P = 0.0006; Fig. 2). This was similar to our previous fMRI experiment using an Accept/Reject task where individuals accepted or rejected a lottery relative to a sure option (Wright et al., 2012) (independent samples t-test PropRiskall here versus PropRiskall in previous Accept/Reject fMRI dataset t(45) = 0.07, P > 0.9).  To examine an inﬂuence of valence on choice, a simple metric is given by the difference in riskier choices in each domain (ImpValence = PropRiskgain − PropRiskloss). We ﬁrst showed that individuals were sensitive to valence (ImpValence −0.15 ± 0.22; one-sample t-test versus no effect of valence, t(24) = −3.31, P = 0.003; Fig. 2), and to a similar degree to that seen in our previous fMRI study using the Accept/Reject task (independent samples t-test for modulus of ImpValence here versus previous Accept/Reject fMRI dataset t(45) = 0.07. P > 0.7). However, secondly, in contrast to our previous ﬁnding in the Accept/Reject task,  Table 1 Correlations between stimulus aspects. By design there was no correlation between ΔEV and ΔVariance, although due to a limit in the number of trials this was not possible for all other stimulus aspects.

All models have been detailed previously (Wright et al., 2012).  Reaction time data suggesting risk and valence can inﬂuence action-selection through approach–avoidance processes  Reaction time (RT) data are consistent with the predictions of a model-free approach–avoidance hypothesis, replicating previous behavioural ﬁndings (Wright et al., 2012). Individuals are slower to approach aversive stimuli and are faster to approach appetitive stimuli (Guitart-Masip et al., 2011), which makes simple RT predictions. Regarding valence, individuals will be slower to approach (choose) options containing losses than gains, and this was the case (gains 542 ± 118 msec; losses 654 ± 147; t(24) = 8.17, P b 1 × 10−6). Regarding risk, whether stimulus feature is aversive, neutral or appetitive depends on an individual's risk preference. Thus, we predicted that risk-averse individuals would be signiﬁcantly slower to approach risk; risk-neutral would show no RT bias and risk-seeking subjects would be faster to approach risk. Note as effects of risk depend on individuals' subjective preferences we examined between subjects. Here, individuals' risk preference with gains (PropRiskgain) strongly predicted an RT bias when approaching (choosing) the riskier relative to the surer option (RTriskier − RTsurer) with gains (r = −0.71, P = 8 × 10−5, d.f. = 23); and risk preference for losses (PropRiskloss) strongly predicted the RT bias with losses (r = −0.84, P = b1 × 10−6, d.f. = 23) (Fig. 3).  Finally, we asked whether there was a facilitatory effect of increased EV on RTs, where we predicted that a larger sum of EVs (∑EV) in a trial would be related to faster RTs. However, we note that as the EV of two options becomes closer (ΔEV) that choice difﬁculty (and thus RT) will also increase, and that (∑EV) here correlates with variance related stimulus aspects (∑Var, ΔVar; Table 1) which must be accounted for in the analysis. We tested for a facilitatory effect of ∑EV by regressing RTs for each individual subject against a model containing all four regressors (∑EV, ΔEV, ∑Var, ΔVar) to identify correlations between individual's RT data with the unique components of each regressor. Next we brought the regression coefﬁcients from all individuals up to the group level where they are treated as a new response variable (analogous to group analysis in SPM; (Friston, 2004)). As predicted, the group mean regression coefﬁcient for ∑EV was negatively signed (i.e. faster with greater ∑EV), as were those for ΔEV and ΔVar (i.e. slower with smaller differences), and was positively signed for (∑Var) as might be expected given overall risk-aversion. One-sample t-tests showed that these regression coefﬁcients were signiﬁcantly different to zero (P ≤ 0.003 for all four regressors).  Factorial fMRI analyses suggesting valence and risk can inﬂuence action-selection through approach-avoidance processes  In a simple factorial analysis, for both valence and risk we previously found neural data reﬂecting contingencies between those stimulus properties and responsive actions in the Accept/Reject task (Wright et al., 2012). As those behavioural contingencies were selectively altered in the current task, we asked if this was reﬂected neurally by implementing the same 2 valence (gain, loss) by 2 choice (riskier, surer) factorial analysis (details of this main GLM in Methods). Activity is whole-brain cluster-level corrected unless otherwise stated.  Regarding valence there were two main behavioural ﬁndings. Firstly, valence inﬂuenced choice here to the same degree as in the Accept/Reject task. Secondly, the nature of this valence effect was altered (here increased riskier choices for losses than gains, the reverse was seen in the Accept/Reject task; Fig. 2). Both these effects were reﬂected neurally. Firstly, consistent with previous data there was enhanced activity for losses > gains in anterior insula (bilateral here: −33 23 4, Z = 3.7, 89 vox, SVC; 33 26 4, Z = 4.1, 65 vox, SVC), a region  Fig. 2. Risk and valence inﬂuence choice behaviour. To facilitate direct comparison, we present data from a) our previous fMRI study using the Accept/Reject task (Wright et al., 2012) and b) the current fMRI dataset. The paradigms were carefully matched (e.g. very similar parametric manipulations of ΔEV and ΔVar), except that in the Accept/Reject task in each trial individuals accepted or rejected a lottery relative to a sure option. In both experiments, risk preference is reﬂected by the proportion of riskier choices made (PropRisk; risk-averse b 0.5; risk-neutral = 0.5; risk-seeking > 0.5). Regarding risk, both paradigms revealed the same degree of risk aversion overall (independent t-test PropRiskall here versus PropRiskall in previous Accept/Reject fMRI dataset t(45) = 0.07. P > 0.9). Regarding valence, a simple metric for the impact of valence on choice is given by the difference in riskier choices in each domain (ImpValence = PropRiskgain − PropRiskloss). Individuals were sensitive to valence here, and the magnitude of this valence effect was the same as in our previous fMRI experiment using the Accept/ Reject task (independent t-test for modulus of ImpValence here versus previous Accept/ Reject fMRI dataset t(45) = 0.07. P > 0.7). However, in contrast to the Accept/Reject task, here valence caused the reverse effect such that individuals gambled more for loss compared to gain outcomes. Error bars show s.e.m., **P b 0.005, ***P b 0.00005.  we now ﬁnd that valence caused a reverse effect such that individuals gambled more with loss (PropRiskloss 0.48 ± s.d. 0.20) than gain outcomes (PropRiskgain 0.33 ± s.d. 0.12; t(24) = −3.31, P = 0.003). Thus, individuals were risk averse with gains (PropRiskgain one-sample t-test versus risk-neutral t(24) = −7.14, P = 2.2 × 10−7) and risk neutral with losses (PropRiskloss one-sample t-test versus risk-neutral t(24) = −0.54, P = 0.6).  Finally, we note a considerable heterogeneity between different individuals' preferences related to risk (PropRiskall mean 0.40, range 0.11 to 0.61) and valence (ImpValence mean −0.15, range −0.63 to 0.27). In previous datasets an individual's sensitivity to risk and valence were unrelated (Wright et al., 2012) but here these were correlated (PropRiskall correlated with ImpValence r = −0.48, P = 0.014, d.f. = 23), but here this correlation was not robust to removal of the two participants with the most extreme PropRiskall (r = −0.38, P = 0.074, d.f. = 21).  Behavioural modelling: EV, risk and valence inﬂuence choice  Behavioural modelling conﬁrmed that EV, risk and valence inﬂuenced choice, with the same winning model here as in our multiple datasets reported previously in Wright et al. (2012). The effects of EV, risk and valence are seen clearly by comparing three related “summary statistic” models. A Mean-Only model where individuals care only about the EV of the options correctly predicted 64% ± s.d. 7% of an individual's choices (summed BIC = 6145). The model is improved by adding the inﬂuence of risk in the Mean–Variance model (BIC = 5635), which in turn is greatly improved by also accounting for valence in our Mean–Variance– Valence model (BIC = 5322) where there are separate risk parameters for each valence. This winning Mean–Variance–Valence model outperformed more standard Expected Utility, simple Prospect Theory and more complex Cumulative Prospect Theory models. Furthermore, in absolute terms, the winning Mean–Variance–Valence model correctly predicted 75% ± s.d. 7% of an individual's choices (range 61% to 89%). The risk-related parameters (ρ) from this winning model and the simpler metric described above (PropRisk) were highly correlated for  N.D. Wright et al. / NeuroImage 81 (2013) 431–440  435  Fig. 3. Loss and risk bias reaction times as predicted by approach–avoidance mechanisms. a) Valence biassed RTs as predicted by an approach–avoidance mechanism, with individuals slower to choose (approach) options with losses than with gains. We show the four possible stimulus-action pairs (Gainriskier, Gainsurer Lossriskier Losssurer). RTs were normalised per subject. Error bars show s.e.m. b) Risk biassed RTs as predicted by an approach–avoidance mechanism. As the effect of risk depends on individuals' subjective preference we looked between subjects. An individual's risk preference with gains (i.e. PropRiskgain) strongly predicted their RT bias (RTriskier − RTsurer) with gains; and their risk preference with losses strongly predicted their RT bias with losses. We observe our predicted pattern, where: risk slowed approach when risk was aversive; risk induced no RT bias when risk was neutral; and risk speeded approach when risk was appetitive (panel c is a cartoon of these predictions). Regression lines are shown, which are not constrained in any way. Grey lines show risk-neutrality in choice (i.e. PropRisk = 0.5) and no RT bias (i.e. RTriskier − RTsurer = 0). Gains are in blue, losses in red.  implicated in aversive representations (Calder et al., 2001) as well as here also in SMA (whole-brain corrected; Table 2). We again found greater activity for gains > losses in value-related regions including OFC, vmPFC, dorsal and ventral striatum (Table 2), consistent with what we observed previously (greater activity here for gains > losses SVC around the OFC/vmPFC cluster peaks reported previously (Table 1 in Wright et al., 2012), in the striatal cluster reported previously and in ventral striatum for positive stimuli in O'Doherty et al. (2004)).  We next asked whether the second ﬁnding of the altered nature of the valence effect between tasks was also mirrored at the neural level. In the Accept/Reject task the least preferred valence-action pair behaviourally (Lossrisky; Fig. 2a here) was the only one associated with increased anterior insula activity (Fig. 4a here). In contrast, behaviour suggested that in the current study there was equal aversiveness in both actions with losses (i.e. risk-neutral choices and equally slowed RTs with losses here; Fig. 2b), and this was reﬂected here in a similar degree of enhanced bilateral anterior insula and SMA activity when approaching either option with losses (Fig. 4d; no activity for Lossriskier > Losssurer or the reverse in 10 mm spheres centred on the peaks in these regions for losses > gains here or for the interaction in the Accept/Reject task). Further, this did not simply reﬂect a lack of choice-related activity in these regions, as behaviour across subjects showed that aversion to risk with gains was reﬂected neurally by increased activity for choosing the riskier than surer option with gains (i.e. Gainriskier > Gainsurer) in right AI and SMA (10 mm spheres as above, SVC; Fig. 4).  Regarding risk, across subjects there was equivalent aversion to risk overall (i.e. collapsed across valence) as in our previous task (Fig. 2). This similarity was reﬂected neurally, as we again observed increased activity for approaching (choosing) the riskier, relative to the surer, option in multiple regions (right parietal cortex, mid-cingulate/ dmPFC, right anterior insula/IFG) but nothing in the reverse contrast (i.e. chose surer > riskier; Table 2). Furthermore, consistent with an approach–avoidance hypothesis, where here as previously the more averse an individual was to risk (i.e. lower PropRiskall) the greater the activity evoked when approaching (choosing) the riskier option in bilateral anterior insula, dmPFC/SMA, bilateral parietal cortex and thalamus/caudate (Fig. 4). Analysing each valence separately showed similarly asymmetric patterns across and between subjects (Supplementary results).  Finally, we asked if these ﬁndings were speciﬁc to valence and risk, or were instead related more generally to choosing options containing less preferred stimulus aspects (e.g. lower EV or lower SV). No such activity was seen either in an alternative factorial design using EV to deﬁne choice (i.e. 2 valence [gain, loss] by 2 choice [higher EV, lower EV]),  or in a further alternative GLM that used subject-speciﬁc SVs from the winning behavioural model to deﬁne choice (i.e. chose higher SV or lower SV). Further, our ﬁndings related to approaching risk and loss above were still evident even after removing activity related to choosing either lower/higher EV or lower/higher SV (details in Supplementary materials).  Parametric analyses of EV and variance encoding  We next used parametric analyses to examine EV and risk encoding in multiple risky options. The difference in EV and risk between the two options in each trial (ΔEV and ΔVar) were used as parametric modulators in the main GLM above, and corresponded to the manipulations of ΔEV and ΔVar in the stimulus set (Fig. 1b). In our previous Accept/ Reject task the parametric regressors for EV and risk also represented ΔEV and ΔVar (Wright et al., 2012). As previously there was a positive correlation with ΔVar, although here in left anterior insula and medial PFC rather than in posterior parietal cortex seen before, and again no correlation with EV (Table S2).  However, a problem for any paradigm in which choices involve only one risky option (including our previous study) is that a ΔVar regressor is identical to a regressor reﬂecting the sum or mean of the risk (∑Var). Such activity may be predicted for a region simultaneously encoding both options. If a ﬁxed sure option is used between trials, regressors for ΔEV and ∑EV are also identical. Importantly, in the current task with two risky options these are not identical. Indeed a modiﬁed GLM instead using ∑EV and ∑Var revealed more widespread risk-related activity with ∑Var, that included bilateral posterior parietal cortex consistent with our previous study (and also dmPFC, bilateral anterior insula, bilateral dorsal striatum, left MTG, left MFG; no correlation with ∑EV; Table S2).  However, although regions correlating with ∑Var and ΔVar in these separate GLMs only partially overlapped, these regressors were correlated (Table 1). Thus, to identify an activity uniquely attributable to each regressor (i.e. not with their shared components) in a new GLM we included all four parametric regressors without orthogonalisation (∑EV, ΔEV, ∑Var, ΔVar). Here the activity strongly correlated with the unique components of ∑Var (positive correlation in left posterior parietal cortex, left and right IFG/MFG, cerebellum and right sensorimotor cortex) and ΔVar (positive correlation in ventromedial PFC/subgenual ACC; and negative correlation in right and left MFG and occipito-temporal cortex; Table 3). No activity correlated with ∑EV or ΔEV.  Whilst EV encoding was not revealed by these models an alternative is that EV encoding is determined by which option is chosen. Such  436  N.D.

For risk, the only additional choice-determined activity revealed by this parametric analysis was a positive correlation with the unique component of Varchosen in right posterior parietal cortex, an area also seen in the stimulus-determined model above (peak coordinates for Varchosen also showed activity for ∑Var in the stimulus-determined model). However, as predicted, for EV the choice-determined model revealed extensive activity, and furthermore this was in the directions to be expected for chosen and unchosen values. The unique component of EVchosen positively correlated with activity in precuneus (whole brain corrected) and in OFC previously strongly associated with value (3 44–20, Z = 4.0, 55 vox, SVC), and no regions negatively correlated with EVchosen. The unique component of EVunchosen negatively correlated with activity in left premotor cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum (whole brain corrected) and OFC (−6 44–14 Z = 3.5, 64 vox, SVC), and no regions positively correlated. Finally, we asked if EV and risk encoding differs when potential outcomes entail gains or losses. In the choice-determined model immediately above that revealed EV-related activity (i.e. with EVchosen, EVunchosen, Varchosen, Varunchosen), we also observed extensive activity for the interaction of encoding in gains versus encoding in losses with both EVchosen and EVunchosen (Table 3; Table S3 reports a similar pattern in the stimulus-determined model). Further, this effect of valence on EV encoding was strikingly asymmetric: the chosen option was more positively correlated in gains than losses (EVchosen in gains > EVchosen in losses: dmPFC/ACC, left anterior insula/IFG, left posterior parietal and bilateral MTG) with nothing for the reverse; whilst the unchosen option was more positively correlated in losses than gains (EVunchosen in losses > EVunchosen in gains: pre-SMA/ SMA/MCC, right anterior insula/IFG and right posterior parietal) with nothing seen for the reverse. In both cases the interaction resulted from divergent effects in both gains and losses, with activity  a) Across subjects  Region  Gain > loss  IFG (p. Orb) Mid. orbital gyr.

Wright et al. / NeuroImage 81 (2013) 431–440  437  Fig. 4. Approaching risk and loss: neural data. Valence and risk may affect action-selection by inﬂuencing the disposition to approach economic stimuli, as suggested by fMRI data from the Accept/Reject task (previously reported in Wright et al., 2012) (panels a-b) and new data from the Selection task (panels c-f). a) Regarding valence, in the Accept/Reject task bilateral anterior insula/IFG showed increased activity when approaching (choosing) the lottery with losses (Lossrisky), the speciﬁc stimulus-action pair to which individuals were most averse of the four possible in the task (Gainrisky, Gainsure Lossrisky Losssure) (data from the peak for the choice-by-valence interaction in that task, 30 26–8). However, in the Selection task during loss trials individuals had to approach a lottery with losses, and now bilateral anterior insula activity was raised equally for both options — shown by the main effect for losses > gains (panel c) and no difference in activity between choosing riskier or surer option with losses (panel d, taken from the peak for losses > gains here). Regarding risk, the more averse an individual was to risk (i.e. lower PropRisk), the greater the activity when approaching riskier relative to the surer option, in the gain trials (PropRiskgain vs. riskier > surer in gains, plotted in blue) and loss trials (PropRiskloss and riskier > surer in losses, in red).

Error bars indicate s.e.m.. *b0.05, **b0.005, ***b0.001.  for EVchosen at the highest peak in each region driven by a positive correlation with gains and negative with losses, with the reverse pattern at the peaks seen for EVunchosen. Note that with gains there is a positive correlation with chosen EV (e.g. higher for an EV of £14 than £10; where £10 is the lower EV and has lower activity), and with losses there is a negative correlation with chosen EV (e.g. higher with £-14 than £-10; where £-14 is the lower EV and has higher activity), so activity here does not just positively correlate with chosen EV. In contrast, for risk there was no interaction between encoding in gains versus encoding in losses for any of the risk-related regressors, in the stimulus-determined (∑Var, ΔVar) or choice-determined (Varchosen, Varunchosen) models. We observe correlations with ∑Var in both gains (left IFG, left caudate) and losses (incl. right MFG/IFG, left IFG) and a conjunction between activity correlating with ∑Var in both gains and losses (positive correlation in left IFG pars. triang. and operc., −48 44–8, Z = 3.78, 62 vox, SVC P = 0.007).  Subjective value  Finally, we tested for encoding of subject-speciﬁc SVs from our winning behavioural model in both a choice-determined model (with parametric regressors of SVchosen and SVunchosen) and a stimulus-determined model (with ∑SV, ΔSV). The choice-determined model revealed extensive activity, and furthermore this was in the directions to be expected for chosen and unchosen values (Table S4). The unique component of SVchosen positively correlated with activity in SMA, posterior insula/operculum and bilateral sensorimotor cortex, and no regions negatively correlated with SVchosen. The unique component of SVunchosen negatively correlated with activity in OFC, right amygdala and left  hippocampus, and no regions positively correlated. In contrast, in the stimulus-determined model there were no correlations with either ∑SV or ΔSV.  We can also ask if these SVchosen and SVunchosen regressors better capture activity than EVchosen and EVunchosen in a comparable model containing only those two regressors. These models with SV and EV models revealed similar regions (Table S4), although interestingly the negative correlation with SVunchosen in OFC and right amygdala survived whole brain correction, whilst activity for EVunchosen in these same areas was neither as widespread nor signiﬁcant (Fig. S1).  Discussion  Value-based decision-making can be considered within a processbased account of choice that evolves from option-evaluation to actionselection (Corrado et al., 2009). Regarding option-evaluation, studies examining the neural basis of risky economic choice have suggested two main competing accounts: one involves “summary statistics” that describe the distribution of possible outcomes from a risky choice (Bossaerts, 2010; Preuschoff et al., 2006); the other posits a subjective value (SV) determined by the shape of a utility function, with riskpreference emerging as a by-product of that shape (Rangel et al., 2008). Here we provide further evidence for encoding of “summary statistics”, and by using multiple risky options and manipulating valence we highlight a new characterisation of such encoding. In contrast to these data, there was no clear evidence for encoding of SV in addition to EV.  Risk encoding was seen for both ∑Var and ΔVar in distinct neural regions. These two risk-related metrics are identical when a choice  438  N.D. Wright et al. / NeuroImage 81 (2013) 431–440  Table 3 fMRI parametric analysis. This table shows all activity surviving cluster level correction across the whole brain (P b 0.05 FWE corrected; voxel threshold of P b 0.005 used to deﬁne the clusters) for the speciﬁed contrasts. Panel a) We test for stimulus-determined encoding in a new GLM with four parametric regressors: ∑EV, ΔEV, ∑Var, ΔVar. Panel b) We test choice-determined encoding in a further GLM with four parametric regressors: EVchosen, EVunchosen, Varchosen, Varunchosen. In both new GLMs we do not orthogonalise these parametric regressors, which enable us to examine activity uniquely attributable to each regressor (i.e. not activity correlating with their shared components). Panel c) We test if encoding is valence-dependent by directly contrasting the parametric modulators in gains versus losses (and vice versa), shown here for all four parametric regressors in the choice-determined model (a similar pattern was seen in the stimulus determined model, Table S3). Note that for one subject who was very risk averse (i.e. few riskier choices) neither model could be estimated and thus for these models n = 24.

Activity related to ∑Var might be expected in regions simultaneously encoding risk in both options, and here we observed correlations with the unique component of ∑Var in regions that included parietal cortex. Such parietal activity replicates our previous data with a single risky option in the Accept/Reject task (Wright et al., 2012), and concurs with single unit and fMRI data showing enhanced activity in a similar region during risky decision-making (Huettel et al., 2005; Mohr et al., 2010; Platt and Glimcher, 1999). The difference in risk between options (ΔVar) correlated with activity in vmPFC, a region strongly associated with value difference (Rushworth et al., 2011), although we note this may not simply reﬂect a subjective value representation as this would also be expected to differ between individuals depending on their individual risk-preference. In addition to demonstrating this risk encoding determined directly by the two stimuli presented in each trial (i.e. ∑Var and ΔVar), we also found choice-determined risk encoding expressed in greater activity when the chosen option was riskier than the surer option, as discussed further below. More broadly, the likelihood that multiple different aspects of risk are tracked within the brain during value-based choice is consistent with the phylogenetically ancient nature of risk sensitivity (Kacelnik and Bateson, 1996; Real et al., 1982) and its importance in decision-making (D' Acremont and Bossaerts, 2008).  With respect to EV, we found that encoding depends on which option was chosen (i.e. encoding of chosen and unchosen EVs), consistent with previous data reporting such encoding for SVs (FitzGerald et al., 2009; Rushworth et al., 2011). We observed this EV encoding in expected directions, with positive correlations for EVchosen and negative correlations for EVunchosen (Rushworth et al., 2011). We note that as well as identifying encoding in OFC, a region commonly associated with value (FitzGerald et al., 2009), we also observed activity in hippocampus, a region identiﬁed with reward processing in a meta-analysis of value-based choice (Liu et al., 2011), as well as in precuneus (Viard et al., 2011) a regions also implicated in goal-directed behaviour  N.D. Wright et al. / NeuroImage 81 (2013) 431–440  439  (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006). Further, because we report activity uniquely correlating with EV, we note that such EV encoding may be even more widespread as suggested by the marked activity seen in OFC, bilateral striatum and posterior cingulate for the contrast of gain relative to loss trials, where gain trials involve higher values.  EV encoding also depended upon whether outcomes were gains or losses. As here individuals must evaluate and select between two risky options of the same valence, our data suggest that valence may exert separable effects on chosen and unchosen values. Indeed, the pattern of this valence-dependent encoding highlights the importance of both chosen and unchosen values in shaping behaviour. We acknowledge that decisions are made in the context of only gains or losses in each trial, and future work could usefully examine situations where this was not the case, for example by mixing gains and losses. The greater activity seen here for gains relative to losses shows a striking commonality in striatum and vmPFC/OFC to that observed previously in a related task (Wright et al., 2012), consistent with the striatal expected value encoding seen in experiments using a mean–variance approach (Tobler et al., 2009).  In contrast to the highly robust neural data for summary statistic encoding, we did not ﬁnd similarly clear evidence for encoding of SV over that of EV. However, we note that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Further, the large difference in value between the gain trials and loss trials may have led to more noise in valuation signals, which could have reduced the necessary sensitivity to identify parametric differences in EV or SV within trial types. With respect to reconciling our ﬁndings with those reporting integrated utility representations (Kable and Glimcher, 2007; Rangel et al., 2008), this raises a number of issues. Firstly, if choice is the product of multiple interacting decision systems, it may be that different tasks differentially involve different processes, such that some tasks induce model-based valuations approximating a uniﬁed utility signal, whilst others will not. Second, previous work may not always have conducted contrasts necessary to show neural data consistent with additional processes. For example with respect to valence, an interaction of choice and valence consistent with approach–avoidance was a central ﬁnding in DeMartino et al. (2006) as well as our previous dataset (Wright et al., 2012); but such a contrast was not reported in Tom et al. (2007) (see Wright et al., 2012 for more extensive discussion). Third, we note here that a recent study showing that SV representations of more complex multi-attribute stimuli may have a distributed representation, and may only be detectable using multivariate but not standard mass univariate analysis (Kahnt et al., 2011). Fourth, we note that EV representations here may in fact reﬂect model-based values, with the additional inﬂuence on action-selection from valence through distinct approach–avoidance processes that is not integrated within a uniﬁed utility signal.  Finally, how our manipulations of risk, valence and EV inﬂuence action-selection can be viewed from a perspective where choice is the product of multiple interacting decision systems that each inﬂuence action-selection, including both reﬂexive model-free systems, and more sophisticated model-based systems (Dayan, 2008). As in our previous Accept/Reject task (Wright et al., 2012) we ﬁnd robust patterns of RTs and neural activity consistent with the hypothesis that risk and valence may, at least in part, inﬂuence action-selection through model-free approach–avoidance processes. Importantly, in model-free approach–avoidance processes the key feature is a contingency between stimulus properties and responsive actions — and we show these behavioural contingencies are selectively altered here in the Selection task relative to our previous Accept/Reject (Fig. 2), and that these selective changes are reﬂected in RT and neural data (Fig. 4). The RT ﬁndings here are explored and discussed in more detail in a series of previous related experiments (Wright et al., 2012). We note that whilst our design here precluded risk-related RT ﬁndings being explained by a motor habit (the side on which the riskier option appeared was random), future work could examine the possibility that they may relate to a higher level type of “habit” by dissociating the number of riskier choices from risk preference. Again, anterior  insula is implicated here and this is a region known to be involved in representing aversive stimuli (Calder et al., 2001; Seymour et al., 2007), but has also been related to interoception (Critchley et al., 2004) and decision-making and addiction (Naqvi and Bechara, 2010). In model-based systems, stimulus features may be incorporated within a uniﬁed SV computed for each option, and action-selection involves choosing the option with the highest SV. We may not ﬁnd clear evidence for uniﬁed SV encoding in addition to that for EV, but note that EV encoding itself may reﬂect a model-based computation and indeed that EV may inﬂuence action-selection through comparison of such model-based values.  Together these data are consistent with a biologically-based account of choice (Wright et al., 2012), where choice is a process involving both option-evaluation and action-selection (Corrado et al., 2009), and is likely to reﬂect the inﬂuence of multiple interacting decision systems (Dayan, 2008). Speciﬁcally, option evaluation may involve summary statistics. Action-selection may involve both modelbased integration of summary statistics (EV and risk) that inﬂuence action-selection through comparator processes, and also model-free approach–avoidance responses to stimulus properties such as valence not requiring model-based processing.  In conclusion, our data support the suggestion that “summary statistics” describe the distribution of possible outcomes from a risky choice. Our data also show that in keeping with the importance of risk in decision-making, multiple aspects of risk are encoded during value-based choice, including both the sum and difference in risk between two risky options. Instead, neural data here suggested that EV encoding reﬂected chosen and unchosen EVs, and was also crucially dependent on outcome valence. Our data thus support a hypothesis that the brain encodes “summary statistics” describing the distribution of potential outcomes during risky choice, and highlight differences between the encoding of these summary statistics.

Introduction  The   brain   mechanisms   involved   in  processing   another’s   physical   pain   have   been   extensively   studied   in recent   years.   The   link   between   understanding   others’   physical   pain   and   emotional   suffering   is  less   well understood.   Using   whole   brain   analysis   and   two   separate   functional   localizers,   we   characterized   the neural   response   proﬁles   of  narrative   scenarios   involving   physical   pain   (PP),   and   scenarios   involving   emotional  pain   (EP)   with   functional   magnetic   resonance   imaging   (fMRI).   Whole   brain   analyses   revealed   that PP  narratives   activated   the   Shared   Pain   network,   and   that  the   brain   regions   responsible   for   processing   EP overlapped   substantially   with   brain   regions   involved   in   Theory   of  Mind.   Region   of  interest   (ROI)   analysis provided   a   ﬁner-grained   view.   Some   regions   responded   to  stories   involving   physical   states,   regardless of   painful   content   (secondary   sensory   regions),   some   selectively   responded   to  both   emotionally   and physically   painful   events   (bilateral   anterior   thalamus   and   anterior   middle   cingulate   cortex),   one   brain region   responded   selectively   to   physical   pain   (left   insula),   and   one   brain   region   responded   selectively   to emotional   pain   (dorsomedial   prefrontal   cortex).   These   results   replicated   in   two   groups   of   participants given   different   explicit   tasks.   Together,   these   results   clarify   the  distinct   roles   of  multiple   brain   regions   in responding   to  others   who   are   in   physical   or   emotional   pain.  © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In  both  cases,  you  would  likely  recognize  your friend’s  pain,  experience  personal  distress  in  response  to  her  suffering,  and  feel  motivated  to  help  her.  Accurately  knowing  what another  is  feeling,  ‘sharing’  that  experience,  and  feeling  motivated to  help,  are  all  elements  of  empathy  (Batson,  2009).  But  is  the  mechanism  of  empathy  the  same,  when  the  target  is  broken  bones  versus a  broken  heart?  Previous  studies  on  pain  experience  (and  perception)  have focused  on  physical  pain.  These  studies  have  identiﬁed  a  number of  brain  regions  that  respond  to  the  sensory  aspects  of  pain  (e.g. a  strong,  crushing  pressure  on  the  ﬁngers).  For  example,  primary and  secondary  sensory  areas  have  been  shown  to  help  discriminate  the  location  and  quality  of  a  painful  stimulus  (e.g.  Craig, 2002;  Rainville,  Duncan,  Price,  Carrier,  &  Bushnell,  1997).  Other brain  regions  are  associated  also  with  an  affective  or  motivational  ∗ Corresponding  author  at:  Building  46-4021,  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology,  43  Vassar  St.,  Cambridge,  MA   02130,  USA.

These  aspects  of pain  are  associated  with  activity  in  the  anterior  insula  and  anterior  middle  cingulate  cortex  (aMCC).  For  example,  activity  in  insula and  aMCC  is  modulated  by  participants’  anticipation  of  pain,  and feelings  of  threat  from  an  injury  (e.g.  Atlas,  Bolger,  Lindquist,  & Wager,  2010;  Wiech  et  al.,  2010).  Anterior  insula  activity  has  also been  associated  with  other  negative  affective  experiences,  including  feeling  and  observing  disgust  (Jabbi,  Bastiaansen,  &  Keysers, 2008).  These  three  regions  all  show  activity  both  while  experiencing  physical  pain,  and  while  watching  someone  else  experience physical  pain,  across  a  large  range  of  contexts  and  stimuli  (Botvinick et  al.,  2005;  Gu  &  Han,  2007a;  Immordino-Yang,  McColl,  Damasio, &  Damasio,  2009;  Jackson,  Meltzoff,  &  Decety,  2005;  Lamm,  Batson, &  Decety,  2007;  Singer  et  al.,  2004;  Xu,  Zuo,  Wang,  &  Han,  2009), and  the  amount  of  activity  in  these  regions  is  correlated  with trial-by-trial  measurements  of  the  intensity  of  physical  pain  experienced  (e.g.  Peyron,  Laurent,  &  Garcia-Larrea,  2000),  or  observed (e.g.  Saarela  et  al.,  2007).  Since  the  insula  and  aMCC  respond  to  the ﬁrst  and  second  person  experiences  of  pain  (although  see  Morrison &  Downing,  2007),  they  are  referred  to  as  the  ‘Shared  Pain  network’,  and  have  been  hypothesized  to  serve  as  a  “bridge”  between an  observer  and  a  victim.  Activity  in  common  brain  regions  could  220  E.G.  Bruneau  et  al.  /  Neuropsychologia  50 (2012) 219–  231  enable  ‘shared’  affective  responses,  which  then  support  empathy (De  Vignemont  &  Singer,  2006;  Sommerville  &  Decety,  2006)  and pro-social  behavior  (Preston  &  De  Waal,  2002).  Along  with  the  primary  sensory  and  affective/motivational aspects  of  pain,  however,  there  can  also  sometimes  be  a  secondary  emotional  response:  for  example,  feelings  of  sadness  or anger,  which  can  grow  into  full  blown  emotional  states  involving “uniquely  human”  emotions,  such  as  sadness  that  broken  ﬁngers will  prevent  you  from  playing  the  piano  in  a  concert,  the  resulting  remorse  or  embarrassment  as  you  anticipate  telling  colleagues, melancholy  knowing  that  you  may   never  play  the  same  again,  and so  on.  These  same  emotions  often  arise  in  the  absence  of  physical pain.  Do  the  brain  regions  involved  in  the  ‘Shared  Pain  network’ form  the  basis  of  empathic  reactions  to  another’s  emotional  suffering  that  involves  no  physical  pain  at  all,  like  a  close  friend’s  divorce? Some  recent  evidence  suggests  that  they  could.  Eisenberg  and  colleagues  (Eisenberger,  Lieberman,  &  Williams, 2003;  Eisenberger  &  Lieberman,  2004;  Masten,  Morelli,  & Eisenberger,  2010)  have  developed  a  paradigm  to  create  ‘social pain’  in  the  laboratory.  In  this  paradigm,  called  “Cyber  Ball”,  three players  pass  a  ball  back  and  forth;  after  a  short  period,  two  of  the players  exclude  the  third  player  from  the  exchange.  The  ﬁrst-hand social  exclusion  experienced  by  the  third  player  is  associated  with activity  in  ‘Shared  Pain  network’  including  anterior  insula  and  middle  cingulate  regions.  One  hypothesis  is  therefore  that  responding  to  others’  misfortunes,  across  the  whole  gamut  from  broken  ﬁngers  to  a  broken heart,  depends  on  one  common  neural  system,  especially  including  the  anterior  insula  and  middle  cingulate.  However,  there  is another  possibility.  Recognizing  another’s  emotional  suffering  may depend  on  a  different  group  of  brain  regions  involved  in  thinking about  another  person’s  mind.  This  so-called  “Theory  of  Mind  (ToM) network”  includes  bilateral  temporo-parietal  junction  (TPJ),  precuneus  (PC),  and  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (mPFC)  regions  (Saxe &  Kanwisher,  2003).  There  is  considerable  evidence  that  these regions  are  recruited  when  thinking  about  others’  emotional  experiences.  For  example,  there  is  activity  in  the  ToM  network  when participants  evaluate  the  mental  states  of  characters  in  cartoons who  are  reacting  to  emotionally  salient  information  (Atique,  Erb, Gharabaghi,  Grodd,  &  Anders,  2010;  Hooker,  Verosky,  Germine, Knight,  &  D’Esposito,  2010;  Hooker,  Verosky,  Germine,  Knight,  & DíEsposito,  2008;  Schnell,  Bluschke,  Konradt,  &  Walter,  2010;  Vollm et  al.,  2006).  Interestingly,  watching  another  person  be  excluded from  a  Cyberball  game  also  leads  to  activation  in  ToM  regions,  especially  mPFC  and  PC  (Masten  et  al.,  2010;  though  note  that  insula activity  is  also  observed).  The  prior  literature  thus  raises  a  key  question:  what  are  the  relative  roles  of  the  ‘Shared  Pain’  and  ‘ToM’  networks  in  processing (i.e.  recognizing,  representing  and  responding  to)  others’  physical and  emotional  misfortunes?  To  test  this  question,  we  sought  to  portray  individuals’  experiences  of  physical  injuries  versus  emotional  suffering  in  a  single experimental  paradigm.  Short  verbal  narratives  provide  a  useful modality  for  conveying  rich  information  about  another  person’s internal  states.  Previous  studies  of  empathy  for  physical  pain  have used  three  kinds  of  stimuli:  (i)  images  of  the  injury  (e.g.  pictures  or movies  of  sharp  objects  threatening  body  parts)  (Gu  &  Han,  2007a; Jackson  et  al.,  2005;  Morrison  &  Downing,  2007),  (ii)  images  of facial  expressions  reacting  to  injury  (Botvinick  et  al.,  2005;  Lamm et  al.,  2007;  Saarela  et  al.,  2007),  or  (iii)  symbolic  cues  that  predicted  actual  painful  stimulation  of  a  person  who  is  present,  next to  the  participant  (Singer  et  al.,  2004,  2006).  All  three  kinds  of  stimuli  robustly  activate  the  ‘Shared  Pain’  network.  However,  to  our knowledge,  only  one  previous  study  has  found  activation  in  the ‘Shared  Pain’  network  using  verbal  descriptions  of  painful  events (Gu  &  Han,  2007b).  We   therefore  ﬁrst  ask  whether  (and  which)  regions  involved  in  representing  another’s  physical  pain  can  also be  recruited  by  abstract  verbal  stories  (cf.  Jabbi  et  al.,  2008).  Second,  we   ask  whether  the  same  brain  regions  are  recruited by  stories  about  physically  painful  injuries,  versus  about  emotional  suffering  without  physical  pain.  As  described  above,  physical injuries  are  often  accompanied  by  affective  experiences,  even including  complex  emotions  such  as  fear,  loss,  remorse,  and  humiliation;  nevertheless,  it  is  often  possible  to  dissociate  physical  pain from  emotional  suffering,  especially  in  misfortunes  that  involve intense  emotional  suffering  in  the  absence  of  physical  pain.  We therefore  presented  participants  with  short  stories  from  6  conditions  that  described  a  protagonist  experiencing:  (1)  physical  pain [PP]  (e.g.  cutting  a  ﬁnger  to  the  bone),  (2)  physical  sensations  without  pain  [PPC]  (e.g.  cutting  vegetables),  (3)  emotional  suffering  [EP] (e.g.  proposing  marriage  and  being  rejected),  (4)  emotions  without suffering  [EPC]  (e.g.  proposing  marriage  and  being  accepted),  (5)  a false  belief  causing  emotional  suffering  [FBP]  (e.g.  falsely  believing that  a  girlfriend  is  having  an  affair),  or  (6)  a  false  belief  that  does not  cause  suffering  [FBC]  (e.g.  falsely  believing  that  your  girlfriend just  boarded  a  bus).  Scenarios  involving  false  beliefs  were  included because  they  have  been  shown  previously  to  be  particularly  effective  at  activating  the  ToM  network  (Hooker  et  al.,  2008).  Our  design  had  two   further  elements.  First,  we  manipulated  the explicit  task  instructions  of  the  participants  in  the  scanner.  Because verbal  stimuli  are  rarely  used  in  studies  of  empathy,  especially empathy  for  pain,  we  tested  whether  the  response  in  ‘Shared  Pain’ regions  to  stories  about  misfortunes  depends  on  task  instructions. One  group  of  participants  was  instructed  to  quantify  the  pain  or suffering  experienced  by  the  protagonist  of  each  story.  Objectively quantifying  the  pain  in  the  story  may   reduce  participants’  ability  to react  emotionally  to  the  protagonist’s  misfortune.  A  second  group of  participants  was  therefore  instructed  to  just  ‘try  to  imagine  how the  main  character  feels’  (Batson  et  al.,  1997).  Second,  in  order  to  relate  our  results  directly  to  the  previous  literature,  and  to  maximize  the  power  and  sensitivity  of  our analyses,  we   identiﬁed  brain  regions  of  interest  in  two  separate “localizer”  studies.  In  a  “Pain  Localizer  Experiment,”  participants directly  watched  another  person  receive  a  painful  electric  shock,  or received  a  shock  themselves.  In  a  “ToM  Localizer  Experiment,”  participants  read  about  someone’s  false  belief,  or  an  outdated  physical representation  like  a  photograph  or  a  map.  In  sum,  this  design  allowed  us  to  test  three  key  questions:  (1)  How  are  verbal  scenarios  involving  physical  pain  and  emotional  pain  represented  neurally?  (2) How  are   these  representations  related   to  brain  regions  recruited  during  traditional  Pain  and  Theory  of  Mind  tasks?  (3)  Are   these  brain  activations  robust  across  different   task  demands?  2.  Methods  2.1.

A 23.0  ± separate  group  of  fourteen  participants  (19–33  years  old  (mean  23.5    4.1  s.d.), 8   female)  engaged  in  the  localizer  experiments.

When  creating  the  stimuli,  24  stories  were  created  for  each  Condition,  describing  Painful  experiences,  and  then  a  modiﬁed  version  of  each  scenario was  created,  in  which  outcomes  were  either  neutral  or  positive,  and  were  free  of  pain  E.G.

Participants  were  presented  with  a  random  set  of  12  of  the total  24  stories  from  each  Pain  condition,  and  the  remaining  12  stories  in  each  No Pain  condition.  Stories  in  the  No  Pain  condition  involved  either  neutral  or  positive outcomes  (see  Supplemental  Materials  for  full  set  of  stimuli).

Thus,  within  each  Condition,  Pain  and  No  Pain  scenarios  were  matched for   general  semantic  content.  Across  all  conditions,  scenarios  were  also  matched  for ± number  of  words  (mean  46.9    3.7  s.d.).  (For  sample  scenarios,  see  Table  1;  for  full list   of  stimuli,  see  Supplemental  Material.)  Participants  in  the  Narrative  Study  read  either  the  Painful  or  Non-Painful  Control version  of  each  story  (counter-balanced  across  participants);  in  total  each  participant  therefore  read  72  total  stories.  Each  story  was  presented  for  16  s,  followed by   a  2  s  inter-stimulus  interval.  However,  because  the  ﬁrst  sentence  of  the  story described  the  protagonist’s  background,  we   estimated  that  the  painful  versus  control   outcome  was   experienced  mostly  in  the  last  10  s  of  story  presentation.  Stories were  presented  in  groups  of  3  stories  from  different  conditions.  After  each  group of  3  stories,  there  was  a  12  s  rest  period.  Each  run  contained  12  stories,  2  per  condition,  and  lasted  4.6  min.  The  whole  experiment  consisted  of  6  runs.  The  order  of conditions  and  scenarios  were  counterbalanced  across  runs  and  across  participants. Stimuli  were  presented  in  white  24-point  font  on  a  black  background  via  Matlab  5.0   with  an  Apple  G4  powerbook.  In  order  to  examine  the  effects  of  task  demands  on  processing  the  narratives, participants  were  all  presented  with  the  same  stimuli,  but  were  given  different assignments  in  response  to  the  stimuli.  At  the  beginning  of  each  run,  prior  to stimulus  presentation,  half  of  the  participants  (n  =  20)  were  given  the  following instructions  both  verbally  and  in  written  text  on  the  screen:  Task  1  (Pain  Rating):  “Read  the  following  stories  and  when  the  prompt  appears indicate  how  much  pain  or  suffering  the  protagonist  of  the  story  feels  at  that moment.”  During  each  story,  a  single  response  prompt  appeared  below  the  story  for  the ﬁnal  4  s  of  the  presentation.  The  prompt  asked  participants  to  judge  the  “Protagonist’s  pain  or  suffering”  on  the  following  scale:  1  (None)  –  2  (A  little)  –  3  (Moderate)  – 4   (A  lot).  Subjects  made  their  response  on  an  MR-safe  button  box.  Average  responses and   reaction  times  (RTs)  for  each  condition  were  determined  for  each  individual,  and were  averaged  across  item  for  use  in  Item  Analysis  (see  below).  Behavioral  data  from 2   of  the  participants  included  in  the  study  were  lost  due  to  a  computer  error.  The  other  half  of  the  participants  (n  =  21)  were  instead  given  the  following  instructions:  Task  2  (Active  Empathizing):  “While  reading  each  of  the  following  stories  try  to imagine  how  the  main  character  in  the  story  feels  about  what  has  happened  and how   that  affects  his  or  her  life.  Do  not  worry  about  attending  to  all  the  details  of  the story,  just  concentrate  on  trying  to  imagine  how  the  main  character  feels.”  (adapted from  Batson  et  al.,  1997).  Participants  pressed  a  button  when  they  were  done  reading  each  story. Two  localizer  experiments  were  conducted  in  a  separate  group  of  participants  (see   Supplemental  Materials  for  a  description  of  the  methods).  2.3.   Image  acquisition  and  analysis  Participants  were  scanned  using  a  Siemens  Magnetom  Tim  Trio  3T  System (Siemens  Solutions,  Erlangen,  Germany)  in  the  Athinoula  A.  Martinos  Imagining  Center   at  the  McGovern  Institute  for  Brain  Research  at  MIT   using  30  4-mm-thick  near axial  slices  with  whole  brain  coverage  (TR=  2  s,  TE  =  30  ms,  ﬂip  angle  =  90).  Every experiment  used  a  block  design,  and  was  modeled  using  a  boxcar  regressor.  MRI   data  were  analyzed  using  SPM8  (http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/ spm8/),   SnPM5  (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/research/nichols/ software/snpm/)  and  custom  software.  Each  participant’s  data  were  motion  corrected,  and  then  normalized  onto  a  common  brain  space  (Montreal  Neurological Institute,  EPI  Template).  Data  were  smoothed  using  a  Gaussian  ﬁlter  (full  width  half maximum  =  5  mm)   and  high-pass  ﬁltered  during  analysis.  Functional  images  were  analyzed  using  both  whole  brain  random  effects  analyses,   and  using  group-level  regions  of  interest.  For  whole  brain  analyses,  we  ﬁrst  built a   modiﬁed  linear  model  of  the  experimental  design,  and  used  this  model  to  analyze the   BOLD  response  in  each  voxel.  The  model  included  both  covariates  of  interest  (the experimental  conditions)  and  nuisance  covariates  (run  effects,  an  intercept  term, and  global  signal).  We   modeled  the  conditions  as  a  box-car  (matching  the  onset  and duration  of  each  block)  convolved  with  a  standard  hemodynamic  response  function (HRF).  Time-series  data  were  subjected  to  a  high-pass  ﬁlter  (128  Hz).  To  identify voxels  in  which  effects  of  condition  were  reliable  across  participants,  BOLD  signal  differences  between  conditions  (linear  combinations  of  the  beta  parameters  for condition  covariates)  were  submitted  to  second  level,  random-effects  analysis.  All whole  brain  analyses  were  conducted  using  SnPM  and  used  corrected  p  thresholds, at   p  <  0.05,  based  on  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  the  false  positive  rate  in  these  data (Nichols  &  Holmes,  2004).  To  deﬁne  regions  of  interest,  random  effects  analyses  were  performed  on  the localizer  experiments,  using  a  threshold  of  p  <  0.001  (voxel-wise,  uncorrected),  and a   cluster  threshold  of  k  >  10  on  the  data  from  12  participants  on  the  Theory  of  Mind task,  and  from  13  participants  in  the  Pain  task  (Supplemental  Figs.  1  and  2).  For  the Theory  of  Mind  task  the  contrast  (Belief  >  Photo)  was  used.  For  the  Pain  task,  most regions  were  identiﬁed  using  the  contrast  OtherPain  >  OtherNoPain.  One   region  was identiﬁed  using  the  contrast  SelfPain  >  SelfNoPain.  See  Supplementary  Methods  for more  details.  Coordinates  of  the  peak  voxel  in  each  ROI  were  identiﬁed,  and  all  suprathreshold  voxels  within  a  9  mm  radius  from  the  peak  voxel  deﬁned  the  region of   interest  (ROI).  The  response  at  each  time  point  for  each  story  condition  in the   Narrative  Study  was  calculated  as  the  average  BOLD  response  across  all  voxels  in  each  ROI,  across  all  participants;  this  response  was  then  converted  to × percent  signal  change  as  follows:  PSC  =  100    average  BOLD  response(condition, time)/average BOLD response(rest).  The  BOLD  response  at  rest  was   calculated  as the  average  response  in  each  ROI  during  the  rest  period,  excluding  the  6  s  immediately  following  a  story.  For  the  purposes  of  statistical  analyses,  we  averaged  12–20  s after  story  onset.  This  time  accounted  for  hemodynamic  lag  and  story  design:  information  about  the  negative  or  neutral  outcome  of  each  story  was   only  available  in the   second  part  of  each  story  (where  painful  and  non-painful  versions  of  each  story deviated  from  each  other).  The  data  extracted  from  the  ROIs  were  not  ﬁltered,  other than  averaging.  All  peak  voxels  are  reported  in  MNI   coordinates.  In  order  to  validate  the  stimuli,  a  separate  group  of  participants  were  asked  to rate   the  amount  of  physical  pain  (“How  much  physical  pain  is  the  main  character in?”)  and  the  amount  of  emotional  suffering  (“How  much  emotional  suffering  did  the main  character  experience?”)  in  each  of  the  stories  on  a  scale  from  (1)  none  at  all  to (9)  extreme.  Stories  were  rated  on  Amazon  Mechanical  Turk.  Each  story  was  rated  on each   dimension  by  60  participants.  If  participant  responses  were  unreasonably  fast (representing  a  reading  time  of  >10  words  per  second),  were  >3  standard  deviations from  the  mean,  or  if  they  did  not  answer  a  ‘check’  question  (“I  have  read  the  story completely  and  answered  all  questions  honestly”)  with  anything  other  than  “(9) completely  agree”,  their  responses  were  eliminated.  This  resulted  in  the  exclusion of    ∼15%  of  the  responses. Statistical  analysis  (behavioral  and  fMRI  experiments)  utilized  post  hoc  pairedsamples  t-tests  and  repeated-measures  ANOVAs,  both  conducted  with  an  alpha  level of   0.05.  When  the  signiﬁcance  level  of  the  Mauchly’s  test  was   p  <  0.05,  we  corrected for  sphericity  using  the  Greenhouse–Geisser  correction,  and  we  report  corrected degrees  of  freedom.  3.  Results  3.1.  Behavioral  results  Emotional  Pain  and  False  Belief  Pain  stories  were  deﬁned  in  the current  study  as  scenarios  that  involved  others  experiencing  emotional  suffering  that  did  not  have  a  physical  cause.  Physical  Pain stories  were  deﬁned  as  others  experiencing  physical  pain  that  did not  have  an  emotional  cause.  Although  physical  pain  and  emotional suffering  are  often  confounded  in  real-life  situations,  in  the  current  stimuli  the  PP  scenarios  described  more  physical  pain  than  222  E.G.  Bruneau  et  al.  /  Neuropsychologia  50 (2012) 219–  231  Reaction  time  data  were  analyzed  in  the  same  way   as  the  pain judgments  (Table  2).  The  analysis  revealed  a  signiﬁcant  main  effect of  Condition  (F(1.41,25.3)  =  14.6;  p  <  0.001,  eta2 =  0.45).  Participants were  slower  when  judging  stories  involving  false  beliefs  than  physical  states  (paired-samples  t-test,  t(18)  =  3.8,  p  =  0.001)  or  emotional states  (t(18)  =  4.7,  p  <  0.001)  (averaged  by  participant  across  painful and  non-painful  stories  within  each  condition).  Participants  were also  slower  judging  the  subset  of  False  Belief  stories  involving pain  compared  to  the  stories  involving  Physical  Pain  (t(18)  =  3.4, p  =  0.003)  or  Emotional  Pain  (t(18)  =  3.4,  p  =  0.003).  There  were  no other  main  effects  or  interactions.  3.2.  Neuroimaging  results  3.2.1.  Narrative  Experiment:  whole  brain  analysis  An  initial  whole  brain  analysis  identiﬁed  brain  regions  that responded  to  painful  stories  versus  non-painful  control  stories, regardless  of  condition,  across  both  tasks.  The  contrast  for  the  main effect  of  Pain  revealed  activity  in  regions  of  the  Shared  Pain  network:  the  left  insula,  the  cingulate  cortex  (posterior,  middle  and anterior),  left  secondary  sensory  cortex,  and  bilateral  thalamus,  as well  as  brain  regions  associated  with  Theory  of  Mind:  precuneus, and  medial  and  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (Fig.  2).  We   next separately  examined  the  brain  response  to  the  subset  of  stories involving  physical  pain  (versus  physical  pain  control  stories),  and the  brain  responses  to  stories  involving  emotional  pain  (versus emotional  pain  control  stories).  Relative  to  control  stories,  physical  pain  stories  resulted  in  activity  in  bilateral  insula  cortex  and middle  and  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (Fig.  3).  These  brain  regions are  consistent  with  Shared  Pain  network  brain  regions  found  previously  in  studies  involving  witnessing  others  in  physical  pain (Botvinick  et  al.,  2005;  Lamm,   Decety,  &  Singer,  2010;  Singer  & Frith,  2005).  Emotional  pain  stories,  on  the  other  hand,  resulted in  activity  in  regions  in  the  medial  and  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex,  and  a  region  of  the  posterior  cingulate  (largely  distinct  from  the region  reported  for  physical  pain)  (Fig.  4).  These  regions  are  often associated  with  Theory  of  Mind  (Gallagher  &  Frith,  2003;  Saxe  & Kanwisher,  2003).  Conjunction  analysis  revealed  two  regions  in  the cingulate,  one  anterior  and  one  posterior  to  the  aMCC,  that  were super-threshold  for  both  physical  pain  and  emotional  pain  (over their  respective  control  conditions)  (Fig.  5).  These  results  suggest that  representations  of  others’  physical  pain  and  others’  emotional pain  are  largely  distinct,  but  share  activity  in  small  regions  within the  cingulate  cortex.  For  peak  coordinates  for  all  contrasts,  see Table  3.  To  ﬁnd  regions  that  respond  speciﬁcally  to  Emotional  Pain, − we  also  examined  the  contrast  (EP-EPC)    (PP-PPC).  This  contrast revealed  activity  in  dmPFC,  along  with  regions  along  the  middle temporal  gyrus,  when  using  a  voxel-wise  threshold  of  p  <  0.001, uncorrected;  however  this  result  did  not  survive  the  conservative correction  for  multiple  comparisons  used  in  our  whole  brain  anal− yses.  Relatedly,  the  contrast  (PP-PPC)    (EP-EPC)  did  not  reveal  any voxels  in  the  whole  brain  analysis.  We   then  turned  to  regions  of  interest  (ROI)  analysis.  Statistical tests  in  ROI  analyses  are  more  sensitive  (because  there  are  fewer ROIs  than  voxels  in  the  whole  brain,  reducing  the  multiple  comparisons  problem),  and  also  allowed  us  speciﬁcally  to  test  how  these results  are  related  to  prior  studies  in  the  literature.  Fig.  1.  Average  ratings  of  pain  and  suffering  for  stories  in  each  of  the  conditions.  Stories   involved  physical  pain  (PP),  physical  sensations  without  pain  (PPC),  emotional pain  (EP),  emotional  states  without  pain  (EPC),  false  beliefs  resulting  in  emotional pain  (FBP),  and  false  beliefs  resulting  in  no  pain  (FBC).  Each  story  was   rated  by  a group  of  participants  not  involved  in  the  fMRI  study  across  two   dimensions:  “How much  physical  pain  is  the  main  character  in?”  and  “How  much  emotional  suffering did  the  main  character  experience?”  on  a  scale  from  (1)  none  at  all  to  (9)  extreme. Ratings  were  then  averaged  across  all  of  the  stories  within  each  condition.  Bars represent  average  ratings  for  all  stories  within  each  condition  (±s.e.m.).  emotional  suffering,  and  the  EP  and  FBP  scenarios  described  more emotional  suffering  than  physical  pain.  To  conﬁrm  this,  an  independent  group  of  participants  (n  =  40  per  story)  rated  the  “amount of  physical  pain”  and  “amount  of  emotional  suffering”  experienced  by  the  main  character  in  each  of  the  stories  on  a  scale  of 1  (none  at  all)  to  9  (extreme).  PP  scenarios  were  rated  to  involve ± more  physical  pain  (mean  =  7.7    0.6  s.d.)  than  emotional  suffer± ing  (mean  =  5.1    0.8;  paired  samples  t-test,  t(23)  =  20.6,  p  <  0.001), and  EP  and  FBP  scenarios  to  involve  more  emotional  suffering ± ± (EP:  mean  =  8.0    0.6;  FBP:  mean  =  7.6    0.7)  than  physical  pain ± ± (EP:  mean  =  3.6    0.6;  FBP:  mean  =  3.3    0.7;  both  t(23)s  >  35.0,  both ps  <  0.001).  Relative  to  the  EP  and  FBP  scenarios,  the  PP  scenarios were  rated  to  involve  signiﬁcantly  more  physical  pain  (independent samples  t-tests,  both  t(46)s  >  23.0,  both  ps  <  0.001)  and  signiﬁcantly less  emotional  suffering  (both  t(46)s  >  10.0,  both  ps  <  0.001).  Overall,  there  was  a  signiﬁcant  interaction  between  the  condition  and the  rating,  such  that  PP  stories  were  rated  to  involve  more  “physical  pain”  than  EP  and  FBP  stories  (ANOVA,  F(1,2)  =  207.6,  p  <  0.001), and  PP  stories  were  rated  to  involve  less  “emotional  suffering”  than the  EP  and  FBP  stories  (F(1,2)  =  30.2,  p  <  0.001)  (Fig.  1).  In  the  Narrative  Experiment,  participants’  judgments  of  the characters’  “pain  or  suffering”  from  Task  1  (in  the  scanner)  were × analyzed  using  a  2    3  within-subjects  ANOVA  of  Pain  (pain  versus no-pain  control)  by  Mental  State  Condition  (physical  states,  emotions,  false  beliefs).  Over  all,  participants  judged  that  the  character experienced  more  pain/suffering  in  the  Pain  stories  (main  effect  of Pain,  F(1,18)  =  627.0;  p  <  0.001;  eta2 =  0.97).  There  was  also  an  interaction  of  Pain  and  Condition  (F(2,36)  =  18.6,  p  <  0.001,  eta2 =  0.51), because  participants  judged  the  Emotional  Pain  stories  to  involve more  pain/suffering  than  either  the  Physical  Pain  (paired-samples t-test,  t(18)  =  3.1,  p  <  0.01)  or  False  Belief  Pain  (t(18)  =  3.6,  p  <  0.01) stories.  There  was  no  main  effect  of  Condition  on  pain  judgements (F(2,36)  =  2.0,  eta2 =  0.10)  (Table  2).  Table  2 Average  pain/suffering  ratings  (standard  deviation)  and  reaction  time  means  (standard  deviation)  for  each  of  the  four  experimental  conditions.  Pain  was   rated  in  the  scanner by   subjects  engaged  in  Task  1  on  a  four-point  scale  from  (1)  no  pain  to  (4)  a  lot  of  pain.  Reaction  time  was  measured  in  seconds.

Brain  regions  responding  to  stories  involving  physical  pain  (PP)  versus  matched  control  stories  involving  physical  sensations  that  were  non-painful  (PPC).  Stories involving  PP  activated  regions  previously  shown  to  be  active  during  observing  others  in  physical  pain  (‘Shared  Pain  network’  regions):  bilateral  insula  cortex  (IC),  and  regions in   the  cingulate  cortex  (CC),  including  anterior  middle  and  posterior  regions.

Regions  of  interest  analyses  We  identiﬁed  unbiased  regions  of  interest  in  a  separate  group  of participants  using  two  tasks.  Using  a  standard  localizer  for  Theory of  Mind  brain  regions  (reading  stories  about  Beliefs  >  Photographs) we  identiﬁed  the  components  of  the  “Theory  of  Mind  network”: the  bilateral  TPJ,  PC,  dmPFC  and  vmPFC  (Fig.  S2).  We   used  a  version  of  a  standard  task  (directly  observing  someone  else  receive Painful  or  Non-Painful  electrical  stimulation)  to  identify  regions  in the  pain  network  –  bilateral  secondary  sensory  areas  (SII),  bilateral insula,  bilateral  anterior  thalamus  –  as  well  as  the  dmPFC  (Fig.  S3A). One  other  brain  region  commonly  identiﬁed  as  part  of  the  Shared Pain  network,  the  aMCC,  was  not  signiﬁcantly  recruited  by  the pain  observation  task,  but  did  show  signiﬁcant  activity  when  participants  themselves  experienced  a  Painful  (versus  Non-Painful) electric  shock.  This  region  was  also  included  in  the  ROI  analyses (Fig.  S3B).  We   analyzed  the  data  in  each  ROI  using  a  2   ×   2  mixed ANOVA,  including  within-subjects  factors  of  Pain  (Pain,  No  Pain) and  Mental  State  Condition  (Physical  States,  Emotions,  False Beliefs),  and  the  between-subject  factor  of  Task  (explicitly  rating, actively  empathizing).  ×   3   The  brain  regions  identiﬁed  in  the  Theory  of  Mind  Localizer  are hypothesized  to  play  a  role  in  mental  state  attributions.  Consistent with  that  hypothesis,  all  of  these  regions  showed  a  signiﬁcant  main effect  of  Condition:  in  the  Narrative  Experiment,  False  Belief  (FBP and  FBC)  and  Emotional  (EP  and  EPC)  stories  elicited  a  signiﬁcantly higher  response  than  Physical  stories  (PP  and  PPC)  across  all  ROIs (F-statistic  for  mixed  model  ANOVAs  in  each  brain  region  >  27.0, all  p-values  <  0.001)  (Fig.  6A)  (see  Fig.  7A  for  sample  timecourse). Most  of  these  regions  did  not  respond  more  to  stories  involving  Pain  over  stories  involving  No  Pain.  Indeed,  pairwise  t-tests  within each  condition  revealed  that  rTPJ  and  lTPJ  responded  more  to  nonpainful  compared  to  painful  physical  experiences  (rTPJ:  t(40)  =  2.8, p  =  0.008;  lTPJ:  t(40)  =  3.9,  p  <  0.001).  Of  all  the  Theory  of  Mind  brain regions,  only  the  dmPFC  showed  a  main  effect  of  Pain.  In  pairwise comparisons,  the  dMPFC  discriminated  between  False  Belief  stories involving  Pain  or  No  Pain  (FBP  >  FBC:  t(40)  =  3.2,  p  =  0.003),  while  not discriminating  between  EP  and  EPC  stories  (t(40)  =  1.4,  p  =  0.16),  or painful  and  non-painful  Physical  stories  (PP  versus  PPC,  t(40)  =  0.7, p  =  0.50).  The  interaction  between  Pain  and  Condition  in  the  dmPFC did  not  reach  signiﬁcance  (F(2,78)  =  2.0,  p  =  0.14).  The  pattern  of  activity  in  these  brain  regions  was  remarkably similar  across  the  two   Tasks  (see  Fig.  S4):  there  were  no  main  effects of  Task,  or  any  interaction  involving  Task,  in  any  of  the  Theory  of Mind  ROIs  (mixed  model  ANOVAs;  all  p-values  >  0.05).  In  general,  brain  regions  identiﬁed  in  the  Pain  Localizer  experiment  were  hypothesized  to  be  involved  in  responding  to  another’s physical  pain.  The  Pain  Localizer  experiment  identiﬁed  a  region of  interest  very  near,  and  partially  overlapping,  the  dmPFC  region identiﬁed  by  the  ToM  Experiment.  Interestingly,  this  region responded  selectively  to  stores  about  emotional  pain  (for  timecourse  see  Fig.  7B):  main  effects  of  Condition  (F(1.7,65)  =  47.8, p  <  0.001)  and  Pain  (F(1,39)  =  19.3,  p  <  0.001)  were  modulated  by  an interaction,  such  that  Emotional  but  not  Physical  Pain  led  to  an enhanced  response  (F(1.7,67.8)  =  5.4,  p  =  0.009).  Within-condition pairwise  comparisons  further  showed  a  stronger  response  to EP  >  EPC  (t(40)  =  4.3,  p  <  0.001)  and  FBP  >  FBC  (t(40)  =  4.5,  p  <  0.001), but  not  for  PP  >  PPC  (t(40)  =  1.3,  p  =  0.19)  (Fig.  6B).  Otherwise,  the  patterns  of  activity   in  the Shared  Pain  network  were  consistently  different  from  those  of  the  in  the  regions   E.G.

This  contrast  revealed activation  in  medial  frontal  regions:  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC)  and  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (mPFC)  extending  into  the  anterior  cingulate  cortex,  as  well  as  a region  in  the  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (pCC).

The  insula,  for  example,  showed  a  preference  for  stories  describing  physical  experiences,  especially  painful ones  (for  timecourse  see  Fig.  7C).  In  the  Left  Insula,  main  effects of  Condition  (physical  >  emotion  and  false  belief,  F(1.7,64.7)  =  58.6, p  <  0.001)  and  Pain  (pain  >  control,  F(1,39)  =  14.2,  p  =  0.001)  were × mediated  by  a  Pain    Condition  interaction  (F(2,78)  =  4.6,  p  =  0.013). Physical  pain  stories  elicited  higher  responses  than  non-painful physical  control  stories  (t(40)  =  5.7,  p  <  0.001),  whereas  pain  did  not affect  the  response  to  stories  about  emotions  or  false  beliefs  (both ps  >  0.20).  The  left  insula  also  showed  a  main  effect  of  Task,  showing  higher  activation  across  all  conditions  when  participants  were instructed  to  actively  empathize  (F(1,39)  =  4.4,  p  =  0.043).  Right   for  Condition   (physical  >  emotion  and   insula  showed  a  similar  pattern:  a  signiﬁcant  main effect  false  beliefs, F(1.5,59.4)  =  10.3,  p  =  0.001)  and  a  Pain ×  Condition  interaction (F(2,78)  =  4.9,  p  =  0.010).  Physical  pain  stories  elicited  the  highest response  of  any  condition,  especially  when  participants  were × instructed    Task interaction,  F(2,78)  =  3.4,  p  =  0.038).  For  data  separated  by  task,  see Fig.  S5.  ×   Mental  State   to  actively  empathize   (Pain   The  right  and  left  Thalamus  showed  a  robust  main  effect  of Pain  >  No  Pain,  across  all  conditions  (lThal:  F(1,39)  =  30.5,  p  <  0.001; rThal:  F(1,39)  =  22.6,  p  <  0.001);  all  pairwise  comparisons  were  signiﬁcant  for  painful  over  non-painful  versions  within  each  condition (all  p-values  <  0.01).  The  Thalamus  also  showed  a  trend  towards a  main  effect  of  Mental  State  Condition,  with  higher  responses to  Emotions  and  False  Beliefs  than  Physical  experiences:  lThal: F(1.7,65.6)  =  3.2,  p  =  0.055;  rThal:  F(1.6,62.7)  =  4.0,  p  =  0.031.  The  anterior  middle  cingulate  cortex  similarly  showed  a  robust main  effect  of  Pain  >  No  Pain  across  all  Conditions  (F(1,39)  =  36.1,  p   <  0.001),  and  all  pairwise  comparisons  were  signiﬁcant  for  painful over  non-painful  versions  within  each  condition  (all  ts  >  3.9,  all ps  <  0.001).  Interestingly,  the  aMCC  was  also  sensitive  to  condition, but  in  the  opposite  direction  from  the  thalamus:  the  aMCC  showed a  stronger  response  to  stories  involving  Physical  Sensations  than Emotions  or  False  Beliefs  (F(2,78)  =  41.7,  p  <  0.001)  (for  timecourse see  Fig.  7D).  Finally,  right  and  left  SII  both  showed  higher  responses  for stories  involving  Physical  sensations  than  for  stories  involving Emotions  or  False  Beliefs,  independent  of  Pain  (main  effect  of  Condition:  lSII  F(2,78)  =  35.9,  p  <  0.001;  rSII  F(2,78)  =  20.8,  p  <  0.001)  (for timecourse  see  Fig.  7E).  The  rSII  also  showed  a  higher  response  overall  when  participants  were  instructed  to  actively  empathize  (main effect  of  Task,  F(1,39)  =  5.4,  p  =  0.025),  especially  for  physically  and emotionally  painful  stimuli  (Task  by  Condition  by  Pain  interaction, F(2,78)  =  4.0,  p  =  0.023).  of   in   the   brain   regions   identiﬁed   A  number   the SelfPain–SelfNoPain  contrast  overlapped  with  similar  regions in  the  OtherPain–OtherNoPain  contrast:  bilateral  SII,  bilateral insula  (slightly  more  anterior  in  SelfPain  than  OtherPain),  right thalamus  (slightly  posterior  in  SelfPain  than  OtherPain).  When these  regions  from  the  SelfPain  contrast  were  used  as  ROIs  to examine  the  narratives,  they  produced  similar  results  as  the  ROIs generated  from  the  OtherPain  ROIs  (see  Supplemental  Results).  As  a  control,  we  also  examined  brain  activity  for  the  6  narrative conditions  in  an  ROI  identiﬁed  in  the  OtherPain  >  OtherNoPain  contrast  that  was   thought  to  be  unrelated  to  representations  of  pain. Activity  in  the  right  primary  motor  cortex  (MI)  was  thought  to  be related  to  movement  of  the  left  hand  observed  in  the  Pain  condition  (involuntary  twitching  in  response  to  electrical  shock)  that  did  226  E.G.

(A)  Theory  of  Mind  regions  of  interest  were  identiﬁed  in  a  separate  group  of  participants  who  read  stories  that  involved  making  mental state   attributions  of  others.  Regions  of  interest  were  localized  in  the  right  temporoparietal  junction  (rTPJ),  left  temporoparietal  junction  (lTPJ),  precuneus  (PC),  ventromedial prefrontal  cortex  (vmPFC)  and  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC).  (B)  Shared  Pain  network  regions  of  interest  were  identiﬁed  in  a  separate  group  of  participants  who experienced  and  watched  someone  else  receive  a  painful  electric  shock.  Regions  were  deﬁned  in  the  following  regions:  left  secondary  sensory  (lSII),  right  secondary  sensory (rSII),   left  thalamus  (lThal),  right  thalamus  (rThal),  anterior  middle  cingulate  cortex  (aMCC),  left  insula  (lInsula),  right  insula  (rInsula)  and  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex (dmPFC).

This  ROI  showed  positive activity  for  each  of  the  narratives,  but  there  were  no  signiﬁcant effects  of  Pain,  Condition  or  Task,  or  any  interaction  between  them (for  all  mixed-model  ANOVAS,  F-statistics  <  2.7,  p-values  >  0.05)  (for timecourse  see  Fig.  7F).  4.  Discussion  brain  regions  was   strikingly  similar  across  two   groups  of  participants  and  two   task  contexts,  instructions  to  focus  on  feeling  for  the character  led  to  stronger  responses  across  all  conditions  in  the  left insula,  and  stronger  responses  speciﬁcally  to  painful  experiences  in the  right  insula  and  right  secondary  sensory  region.  These  results provide  a  novel,  detailed  picture  of  the  neural  response  to  complex verbal  descriptions  of  people  in  pain  and  suffering.  We   ﬁnd  that  activity  in  both  the  ‘Shared  Pain’  and  ‘ToM’  brain regions  is  modulated  by  the  content  of  short  verbal  narratives. Overall,  brain  regions  implicated  in  ToM  responded  more  to  stories about  individuals’  mental  and  emotional,  versus  physical,  experiences,  and  brain  regions  previously  implicated  in  observing  others in  pain  responded  more  to  stories  about  physical  than  emotional experiences.  A  subset  of  these  regions  also  showed  a  speciﬁc response  to  painful,  versus  non-painful,  experiences.  Descriptions of  physically  painful  events  led  to  a  speciﬁcally  higher  response  in the  left  insula,  and  descriptions  of  emotional  painful  events  led  to a  speciﬁcally  higher  response  in  the  dorsal  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC).  A  few  regions,  including  the  thalamus  bilaterally  and a  region  of  middle  cingulate  cortex,  showed  a  higher  response  to both  kinds  of  pain.  Finally,  whereas  the  pattern  in  most  of  these  4.1.  Responding  to  others’  physical  pain  This  study  is  one  of  the  ﬁrst  to  investigate  neural  responses to  verbal  descriptions  of  physically  painful  events.  Previous  neuroimaging  studies  of  empathy  have  typically  used  photographs  of faces  in  pain,  body  parts  suffering  injuries,  or  live  people  receiving actual  painful  stimulation  (Botvinick  et  al.,  2005;  Budell,  Jackson, &  Rainville,  2010;  Decety,  Yang,  &  Cheng,  2010;  Lamm,   Meltzoff, &  Decety,  2010;  Morrison,  Lloyd,  Di  Pellegrino,  &  Roberts,  2004; Saarela  et  al.,  2007;  Singer  et  al.,  2004,  2006).  Understanding  empathic  responses  elicited  by  verbal  scenarios is  valuable  for  a  number  of  reasons.  First,  the  response  to  verbal scenarios  may   reveal  the  function  performed  by  each  region  of  the canonical  ‘Shared  Pain  network’.  Some  regions  in  this  network  may  228  E.G.  Bruneau  et  al.  /  Neuropsychologia  50 (2012) 219–  231  respond  only  to  stimuli  that  are  associated  with  actual  threat  to the  participant,  and  not  to  abstract  conceptual  representations  of that  threat.  Second,  many  kinds  of  painful  experience  (especially emotionally  painful  experiences)  are  much  easier  to  describe  and transmit  through  language,  than  through  nonverbal  stimuli  alone. For  example,  it  is  hard  to  convey  in  a  photograph  meanings  like  “the wood  carving  he  broke  was  given  to  him  by  his  mother  just  before she  died,”  or  “his  step-daughter  just  told  him  that  she  hates  him”  (cf. Rameson  et  al.,  2011).  Third,  in  contemporary  culture,  people  often need  to  make  decisions  based  on  empathic  responses  to  individuals who  are  far  away:  for  example,  people  must  decide  whether  and how  to  help  victims  of  cultural  conﬂicts  and  natural  disasters  on  the other  side  of  the  world.  Verbal  narratives  (e.g.  in  books,  magazines, newspapers  and  blogs)  are  one  of  the  dominant  modalities  through which  we  are  asked  to  exercise  our  empathy  for  others.  In  the  present  study,  we  ﬁrst  asked  whether  verbal  descriptions  of  physically  painful  experiences  elicit  activity  in  the  same brain  regions  as  directly  witnessing  another  person  in  physical pain  (cf.  Jabbi  et  al.,  2008).  Key  brain  regions  in  the  ‘Shared  Pain network’,  including  bilateral  anterior  insula,  the  middle  cingulate cortex,  bilateral  secondary  sensory  regions  and  the  anterior  thalamus   all  showed  higher  responses  to  descriptions  of  physical  pain than  descriptions  of  non-painful  physical  events.  The  correspondence  between  these  regions,  and  the  previously  identiﬁed  Shared Pain  regions,  was   corroborated  by  functional  region  of  interest  analyses.  For  the  most  part,  our  results  show  striking  convergence  with the  only  previous  study  to  compare  neural  responses  to  verbal descriptions  of  physically  painful  and  non-painful  events  (Gu  & Han,  2007b).   In  that  study,  participants  read  one-  or  two-character long  descriptions  of  events  (in  Chinese),  and  evaluated  how  painful the  event  would  be.  Compared  to  neutral  events,  descriptions  of painful  events  elicited  activity  in  insula,  bilateral  SII,  and  a  left lateral  occipital  region,  exactly  as  in  the  current  study.  Activity in  the  secondary  sensory  regions  is  especially  interesting,  since the  response  of  SII  was  previously  hypothesized  to  be  restricted to  the  sensory-discriminative  component  of  a  pain  response,  and not  recruited  by  observation  of  pain  (Singer  et  al.,  2004).  Of interest,  we  found  that  both  painful  and  non-painful  physical  experiences  elicited  SII  activity,  compared  to  stories  about  emotions. The  response  in  SII  may   reﬂect  imagery  of  the  sensory  experiences described  in  the  stories  (cf.  Keysers  et  al.,  2004).  Our  study  found  one  signiﬁcant  difference  from  the  prior  (Gu &  Han,  2007b)   study  of  pain  words:  the  cingulate  cortex  did  not signiﬁcantly  distinguish  between  painful  and  non-painful  events in  Gu  and  Han  (2007b),  but  did  in  the  current  results.  Based  on  the absence  of  cingulate  activity,  Gu  and  Han  (2007b)  concluded  that “the  processing  of  pain  induced  by  rating  pain  intensity  of  actions depicted  in  words  is  essentially  different  from  the  processing  of pain  induced  by  noxious  stimuli  and  the  processing  of  imagined pain.”  By  contrast,  the  current  results  show  that  the  cingulate  cortex  is  also  modulated  by  verbal  descriptions  of  pain.  The  verbal narratives  presented  here  may   have  been  more  vivid  than  the  oneand  two-word  phrases  in  the  prior  study.  The  present  study  lends  support  for  the  idea  that  the  role  of  the Shared  Pain  network,  particularly  the  insula  and  middle  cingulate, in  processing  painful  experiences  is  very  general  (cf.  Fan,  Duncan, de  Greck,  &  Northoff,  2010),  not  tied  to  any  speciﬁc  stimulus  (e.g. Lamm,   Decety,  et  al.,  2010;  Lamm,   Meltzoff,  et  al.,  2010),  and  is instead  inﬂuenced  by  participants’  task  and  construal.  Activity  in these  regions,  for  ﬁrst-person  painful  experiences,  is  modulated by  anticipation  and  expectations  (Atlas  et  al.,  2010;  Carlsson  et  al., 2006;  Ploner,  Lee,  Wiech,  Bingel,  &  Tracey,  2010).  Identical  physical stimuli  result  in  higher  insula  activity  (and  higher  pain  intensity  ratings)  if  participants  believe  it  is  more  likely  to  cause  physical  injury (Wiech  et  al.,  2010).  Similarly,  when  observing  another  person  in  pain,  the  insula  and  cingulate  responses  depend  not  on  the  stimulus,  but  on  the  observers’  construal.  Pain  experienced  by  a  loved one  leads  to  more  activity  in  insula  and  cingulate  regions  (Cheng, Chen,  Lin,  Chou,  &  Decety,  2010;  Singer  et  al.,  2004),  while  pain experienced  by  a  disliked  individual  or  group  leads  to  less  activity in  these  regions  (Hein,  Silani,  Preuschoff,  Batson,  &  Singer,  2010; Singer  et  al.,  2006).  Participant’s  construal  can  even  reverse  the stimulus-based  response.  If  the  observer  believes  that  the  person in  the  photograph  experiences  penetration  by  a  needle  as  nonpainful,  and  a  light  touch  by  a  Q-tip  as  painful,  then  the  insula  and middle  cingulate  regions  show  greater  activity  to  the  image  of  the Q-tip  than  of  the  needle  (Lamm,  Meltzoff,  et  al.,  2010).  Over  all, representing  another  person’s  physical  pain  appears  to  depend  on a  highly  similar  network,  whether  the  pain  is  depicted  visually  or verbally,  whether  anticipated,  experienced,  observed,  or  inferred, and  whether  real  or  hypothetical.  Nevertheless  there  was  a  hint  that  verbal  descriptions  elicit  less activity  overall,  in  the  ‘Shared  Pain’  regions,  than  direct  observations.  The  cingulate,  insula  and  secondary  sensory  regions  all showed  signiﬁcantly  negative  BOLD  responses,  below  the  resting baseline,  for  all  stories  except  physical  pain,  and  the  response  of these  regions  to  verbal  stimuli  overall  was   small  in  magnitude.  One consideration  may   be  the  use  of  group  functional  ROIs.  Because inter-subject  alignment  of  anatomical  and  functional  features  is imperfect,  group  ROIs  only  partially  capture  each  individual’s  true corresponding  regions,  leading  to  underestimates  of  the  magnitude and  selectivity  of  the  regions’  responses  (Saxe,  Brett,  &  Kanwisher, 2006).  It  is  also  possible  that  imagining  (or  reading  about)  physical  events  leads  to  less  robust  activation  than  direct  experience. In  prior  studies,  adding  cognitive  load  or  other  distracting  tasks substantially  reduced  activity  in  the  insula,  in  response  to  both words  and  pictures  depicting  painful  events  (Gu  &  Han,  2007a, 2007b;  Kim  et  al.,  2009  but  see  Gu  et  al.,  2010).  On  the  other hand,  at  least  one  prior  study  has  found  stronger  responses  to imagined  than  actual  experiences:  the  right  insula  response  while vividly  imaging  a  disgusting  experience  was   larger  in  magnitude than  when  tasting  or  smelling  a  disgusting  substance  (Jabbi  et  al., 2008).  The  magnitude  of  response  to  verbal  stories  may  therefore be  sensitive  to  how  vividly  participants  imagine  the  contents  of  the stories.  In  our  experiment,  we  found  relatively  small  task  effects  in  the response  of  ‘Shared  Pain’  regions.  Instructing  participants  to  “imagine  how  the  character  feels”  did  lead  to  higher  responses  in  the insula  and  secondary  sensory  regions  than  asking  them  to  rate the  pain/suffering  experienced.  In  general,  though,  the  response  to verbal  stimuli  was   largely  replicable  across  groups  and  tasks.  However,  the  current  task  manipulation  was   relatively  subtle.  Both  tasks focused  attention  on  the  pain  and  suffering  of  the  protagonist.  Tasks that  direct  participants’  attention  away  from  the  painful  content  of the  stimuli  would  likely  have  larger  effects  on  the  neural  response (Gu  &  Han,  2007a;  Gu  et  al.,  2010).  4.2.  Responding  to  others’  emotional  suffering  Verbal  descriptions  of  emotional  experiences  elicited  a  large response  in  brain  regions  implicated  in  thinking  about  others’ thoughts,  including  bilateral  temporo-parietal  junction,  medial precuneus  and  medial  prefrontal  cortices.  Most  of  these  regions showed  equally  high  responses  to  stories  about  emotional  suffering and  those  about  non-painful  emotional  experiences.  That  is,  while these  brain  regions  clearly  distinguished  between  stories  describing  emotional  (mental)  versus  physical  experiences  (see  also  Bedny, Pascual-Leone,  &  Saxe,  2009;  Saxe  &  Powell,  2006),  they  mostly did  not  show  higher  responses  to  stories  describing  painful  emotions.  These  results  are  consistent  with  many  prior  studies  showing that  these  regions  of  the  ‘ToM  network’  are  involved  in  inferences  E.G.  Bruneau  et  al.  /  Neuropsychologia  50 (2012) 219–  231  229  about  a  wide  range  of  beliefs,  intentions,  and  emotions  (Atique  et  al., 2010;  Hooker  et  al.,  2008,  2010;  Schnell  et  al.,  2010).  Since  the  TPJ  and  PC  regions  do  not  respond  more  to  emotionally  painful  events  than  emotional  controls,  should  we   conclude that  these  regions  are  not  involved  in  representing  emotional  suffering?  We   suggest  that  the  ToM  brain  regions  are  involved  in processing  a  large  range  of  mental  and  emotional  experiences,  but distinctions  between  speciﬁc  categories  of  mental  states  are  not detectable  in  the  average  magnitude  of  response.  For  example,  the magnitude  of  response  in  TPJ  also  does  not  distinguish  between  justiﬁed  and  unjustiﬁed  beliefs,  good  and  bad  beliefs,  or  deductive  and inductive  inferences  about  beliefs  (Jenkins  &  Mitchell,  2010;  Young, Nichols,  &  Saxe,  2010).  Instead,  subtle  distinctions  between  categories  of  mental  experiences  –  e.g.  between  positive  and  negative emotions  –  may   only  be  distinguished  by  the  pattern  of  responses across  voxels  (i.e.  neural  populations)  within  these  regions  (Atique et  al.,  2010),  or  by  the  interaction  with  other  Theory  of  Mind  brain regions.  One  brain  region,  however,  did  show  a  selectively   larger response  to  stories  about  emotional  pain:  the  dmPFC.  Prior  studies have  found  dMPFC  activation  while  reading  stories,  looking  at  cartoons,  and  making  inferences  about  characters’  emotions  (Hooker et  al.,  2008,  2010)  and  while  watching  another  person  experience  social  exclusion  (in  Cyberball,  though  this  contrast  also  led  to recruitment  of  insula  and  cingulate  regions,  which  we  did  not  ﬁnd in  the  current  study,  Masten  et  al.,  2010).  Other  recent  studies  have identiﬁed  the  dmPFC  as  a  key  region  mediating  empathic  responses to  others’  suffering.  In  two  studies,  individuals  with  more  activity in  dmPFC  while  observing  others’  suffering  later  offer  more  help to  alleviate  that  suffering.  Individuals  with  more  dmPFC  response to  photographs  of  Hurricane  Katrina  victims  later  donated  more money  to  help  those  victims  (Mathur,  Harada,  Lipke,  &  Chiao,  2010); and  individuals  with  more  dmPFC  response  to  watching  someone be  excluded  from  Cyberball  later  wrote  more  pro-social,  consoling emails  to  the  victims  (Masten  et  al.,  2010;  though  note  that  a  similar correlation  was  observed  in  the  right  insula).  Activity  in  dmPFC  was also  related  to  real-world  empathy:  individuals  who   reported  more frequently  helping  friends  in  their  daily  lives  (in  a  diary  study)  also show  greater  dmPFC  response  to  depictions  of  emotional  suffering (Rameson  et  al.,  2011).  Both  current  and  previous  data  therefore  suggest  that  the  dmPFC plays  a  particular  role  in  recognizing,  representing,  and/or  responding  to  others’  emotional  suffering  and  negative  emotional  states. One  puzzle  for  this  interpretation,  however,  arises  in  our  own   data. We  ﬁnd  that  the  same  region  of  dmPFC  was  recruited  while  observing  another  person  receive  a  physically  painful  electric  shock  (the Other  Pain  localizer)  although  not  while  participants  experienced the  same  pain  (the  Self  Pain  localizer,  and  see  also  Zaki,  Ochsner, Hanelin,  Wager,  &  Mackey,  2007).  Similarly,  in  the  previous  literature  on  empathy  for  pain,  some  studies  do  report  dmPFC  activation, while  others  do  not.  dmPFC  activity  is  typically  not  observed  when participants  look  at  photographs  and  videos  of  human  body  parts being  exposed  to  noxious  stimuli  (e.g.  needles  or  knives,  Benuzzi, Lui,  Duzzi,  Nichelli,  &  Porro,  2008;  Gu  &  Han,  2007a;  Han  et  al., 2009;  Jackson  et  al.,  2005;  Morrison  &  Downing,  2007;  Morrison et  al.,  2004).  By  contrast,  dmPFC  activity  is  observed  when  participants  view  complex  images  of  people  in  the  midst  of  personal tragedy  (e.g.  surrounded  by  post-hurricane  devastation,  Mathur et  al.,  2010),  or  watch  the  facial  expressions  of  people  experiencing  painful  events  (Botvinick  et  al.,  2005;  Decety  et  al.,  2010;  Lamm et  al.,  2007).  A  recent  meta-analysis  of  these  studies  found  that  witnessing  another’s  pain  in  photographs  of  injuries  and  in  live  painful events  (like  our  Pain  Localizer)  both  elicit  common  activity  in  insula and  middle  cingulate;  however,  only  the  live  events,  when  witnessing  someone  else  actually  receiving  a  painful  stimulus,  elicit  activity in  the  dmPFC  and  other  ToM  brain  regions.  Thus,  overall,  the  dmPFC  appears  to  be  recruited  while  witnessing  another  person’s  physical  pain  in  live  events,  but  not  in photographs  (Lamm,   Decety,  et  al.,  2010)  and  not  in  verbal  descriptions  (current  data);  on  the  other  hand,  the  dmPFC  is  recruited when  considering  another’s  negative  emotional  experiences,  both in  live  events  (Cyberball,  Masten  et  al.,  2010)  and  in  verbal  narratives  (current  data).  How  should  these  results  be  integrated?  One possibility  is  that  both  patterns  reﬂect  a  common  role  of  the  dmPFC in  responding  to  negative  emotional  states.  It  is  possible  that  when witnessing  live  painful  events,  participants  spontaneously  attribute more  negative  emotional  experience  to  the  person  being  shocked –  possibly  including  fear,  anxiety  and/or  sadness.  Directly  witnessing  a  live  person  actually  being  harmed  may   encourage  participants to  infer  rich  emotional  and  affective  experiences.  Similarly,  images of  faces  or  entire  tragic  scenes  may   evoke  more  spontaneous  consideration  of  others’  mental/emotional  states  than  photographs  of injured  body  parts.  An  alternative  possibility  is  that  responses  to  physical  pain  (in live  events)  and  emotional  pain  (in  verbal  narratives)  reﬂect  distinct  subregions  within  the  mPFC,  with  different  functional  roles, or  different  aspects  of  a  more  general  response  to  socially  salient stimuli.  In  other  studies  the  dmPFC  has  been  implicated  in  a  wide range  of  social  cognitive  processes,  not  speciﬁcally  linked  to  empathy  (Amodio  &  Frith,  2006),  including  making  judgments  about personality  traits  and  preferences  of  the  self,  and  salient  others  (Krienen,  Tu,  &  Buckner,  2010;  Macrae,  Moran,  Heatherton, Banﬁeld,  &  Kelley,  2004;  Mitchell,  Macrae,  &  Banaji,  2006),  regulating  emotional  behavior  (Ochsner  et  al.,  2004),  and  engaging  in  joint attention  (Redcay  et  al.,  2010;  Schilbach  et  al.,  2010).  Thus  future research  will  be  necessary  to  test  whether  activity  in  the  dmPFC during  live  observation  of  physical  pain  reﬂects  spontaneous  attribution  of  negative  emotional  states  to  the  target.  4.3.  The  link  between  emotional  suffering  and  physical  pain  Reading  stories  about  physical  pain  and  emotional  suffering  lead  to  both  common  and  distinct  patterns  of  brain  activity.  Both  stories  about  physical  pain  (compared  to  physical  control)  and  about  emotional  pain  (compared  to  emotional  control) led  to  activity  in  regions  of  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (in  the  whole brain  conjunction  analysis)  and  in  thalamus  and  middle  cingulate (in  regions  of  interest  analysis).  These  results,  especially  in  the middle  cingulate,  are  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that  understanding  others’  physical  pain  and  emotional  suffering  depends  on a  common  neural  representation,  as  do  ﬁrst-person  experiences of  physical  pain  and  social  rejection  (Eisenberger  et  al.,  2003).  An interesting  alternative  possibility  is  that  activity  during  all  painful stories  may  reﬂect  the  observer’s  own  personal  distress,  caused  by reading  about  pain  and  suffering  (Batson,  2009;  Lawrence  et  al., 2006),  especially  since  activity  in  these  regions  is  not  associated with  helping  the  victim  (e.g.  Masten  et  al.,  2010).  In  addition  to  the  overlapping  responses,  many  brain  regions distinguished  between  stories  describing  emotional  and  physical experiences.  Most  brain  regions  we   tested  showed  some  preference  for  either  physical  or  emotional  events:  in  general,  brain regions  in  the  Shared  Pain  network  showed  higher  responses  to stories  about  physical  experiences,  and  regions  in  the  Theory  of Mind  network  showed  higher  responses  to  stories  about  emotional experiences.  In  addition,  the  dmPFC  and  left  insula  both  showed  signiﬁcant  interactions  between  pain  and  emotional  versus  physical experiences:  the  dmPFC  response  was  highest  to  stories  describing emotional  pain,  and  the  left  insula  response  was  highest  to  stories  describing  physical  pain.  A  plausible  interpretation  of  these results  is  that  representations  of  others’  physically  and  emotionally  painful  experiences  depend  on  at  least  partially  distinct  neural mechanisms.  230  E.G.  Bruneau  et  al.  /  Neuropsychologia  50 (2012) 219–  231  One  puzzle  is  that  these  results  appear  to  conﬂict  with  the only  previous  study  that  directly  compared  responses  to  others’  physically  versus  emotionally  painful  experiences/events (Immordino-Yang  et  al.,  2009).  Participants  in  that  study  ﬁrst watched  detailed  documentary-style  videos,  each  narrating  an individuals’  (i)  physically  painful  experience,  (ii)  emotionally painful  experience,  (iii)  physical  accomplishment  or  skill,  (iv)  prosocial  (altruistic)  accomplishment,  or  (v)  a  neutral  event.  Later,  in the  scanner,  participants  were  brieﬂy  reminded  of  the  whole  narrative;  neural  activity  was  measured  in  response  to  the  reminders. Compared  to  neutral  events,  all  four  conditions  elicited  activity in  a  substantially  overlapping  group  of  brain  regions,  including middle  cingulate  and  bilateral  insula.  Contrary  to  much  of  the previous  literature,  Immordino-Yang  et  al.  (2009)  did  not  report any  regions  of  greater  activity  for  descriptions  of  negative/painful events,  compared  to  positive  events;  contrary  to  the  current  results, Immordino-Yang  et  al.  (2009)  did  not  report  signiﬁcant  differences between  emotionally  and  physically  painful  events  in  the  dmPFC and  left  insula  (or  indeed,  anywhere).  There  are  a  number  of  possible  explanations  of  these  discrepancies.  First,  the  patterns  of  activation  reported  here  may   apply only  to  verbal  stimuli.  Neural  responses  to  physical  pain,  versus social  rejection,  may   be  more  similar  when  elicited  by  live  events (Masten  et  al.,  2010)  or  5-min-long  documentaries  (ImmordinoYang  et  al.,  2009);  perhaps  live  and  highly  detailed  stimuli  elicit stronger  emotional  reactions  than  our  short  narratives,  revealing subtle  patterns  of  shared  activation  that  we  could  not  detect.  For example,  in  a  recent  meta-analysis,  Fan  et  al.  (2010)  found  that direct  observation  of  facial  expressions  of  a  range  of  (basic)  negative  emotions  in  photographs  and  videos  evokes  activity  in  the insula,  whereas  in  our  Narrative  Experiment,  the  insula  response was  limited  to  stories  describing  physically  painful  events.  Future research  should  test  whether  these  patterns  of  neural  responses to  other  people’s  negative  emotions  is  predicted  by  the  modality  of  the  stimuli  (e.g.  live  people  and  photographs  versus  verbal narratives)  or  the  content  (e.g.  primary  emotions  including  pain, fear  and  disgust  versus  secondary  or  complex  emotions,  including loss,  shame  and  regret).  Second,  Immordino-Yang  et  al.  (2009)’s method  –  in  which  participants  see  all  of  the  documentaries,  and are  then  cued  to  retrieve  only  one  –  may   have  led  to  a  blurring  the responses  across  conditions  because  of  imperfect  recall.  Third,  proﬁles  of  neural  activation  may   be  different  while  initially  detecting and  encoding  another  person’s  experience,  versus  while  later  deliberately  recalling  that  experience.  Future  research  will  be  necessary to  test  these  possibilities.  In  some  respects,  though,  the  results  of  Immordino-Yang  et  al. (2009)  do  appear  to  converge  with  the  current  results.  They  did observe  most  activity  in  the  dmPFC  when  considering  an  emotionally  painful  experience,  and  least  activity  (signiﬁcantly  deactivated) when  considering  a  physically  painful  experience.  Also,  consistent  with  our  main  results,  Immordino-Yang  et  al.  (2009)  suggest that  there  is  an  important  neural  distinction  between  responses  to psychological  states  versus  physical  states,  although  they  observe the  largest  difference  in  medial  parietal  regions.  Taken  together, the  results  of  the  current  study  and  Immordino-Yang  et  al.  (2009) suggest  that  an  important  dimension  to  consider,  in  future  neuroimaging  studies  of  empathy,  will  be  whether  the  stimuli  focus  on emotions  versus  physical  pain.  5.  Conclusion  Verbal  narratives  – in  novels,  newspapers,  magazines  and  blogs –  serve  as  one  of  the  dominant  modalities  through  which  we   are asked  to  empathize  with  other  people.  A  single  sentence  can  conjure  a  vivid  representations  of  a  stranger’s  mental  and  physical  experience,  in  some  cases  much  more  effectively  than  a  photograph.  The  current  study  helps  to  clarify  how  narratives  of  others’ pain  and  suffering  are  represented  neurally:  some  brain  regions are  tuned  to  physical  sensations,  regardless  of  pain  (e.g.  SII);  some brain  regions  are  tuned  to  emotions,  regardless  of  suffering  (TPJ, PC,  vmPFC);  some  brain  regions  are  tuned  to  pain,  regardless  of whether  it  is  physical  or  emotional  (thalamus,  anterior  middle  cingulate);  one  brain  region  is  tuned  selectively  to  physical  pain  (left insula);  and  one  brain  region  is  tuned  selectively  to  emotional  suffering  (dmPFC).  While  task  demands  modulate  activity  in  some brain  regions  (especially  right  insula),  these  results  were  remarkably  consistent  across  two   separate  studies.  Future  studies  can therefore  use  these  proﬁles  as  a  foundation  to  investigate  how  and when  empathy  for  pain  and  suffering  fails  (Cikara,  Bruneau,  &  Saxe, 2011).

Introduction  Background:   Early   adolescent   onset   of   substance   use   is  a  robust   predictor   of   future   substance   use  disorders. We  examined   the   relation   between   age   of   substance   use   initiation   and   resting   state   functional   connectivity   (RSFC)   of  the   core   reward   processing   (nucleus   accumbens;   NAcc)   to   cognitive   control   (prefrontal cortex;   PFC)   brain   networks. Method:   Adolescents   in   a  longitudinal   study   of   Mexican-origin   youth   reported   their   substance   use   annually  from   ages   10   to  16   years.   At   age   16,   69   adolescents   participated   in   a  resting   state   functional   magnetic resonance   imaging   scan.   Seed-based   correlational   analyses   were  conducted   using   regions   of   interest   in bilateral  NAcc. Results:  The   earlier   that   adolescents   initiated   substance   use,   the   stronger   the  connectivity   between   bilateral   NAcc   and   right   dorsolateral   PFC,   right   dorsomedial   PFC,   right   pre-supplementary   motor   area,   right inferior  parietal   lobule,   and   left   medial   temporal   gyrus. Discussion:   The   regions   that   demonstrated   signiﬁcant   positive   linear   relationships   between   the   number of  adolescent   years   using   substances   and   connectivity   with   NAcc   are   nodes   in   the   right   frontoparietal network,   which   is   central   to  cognitive   control.   The   coupling   of   reward   and   cognitive   control   networks may   be  a  mechanism   through   which   earlier   onset   of   substance   use   is  related   to   brain   function   over  time, a   trajectory   that  may   be  implicated   in   subsequent   substance   use   disorders.  ©  2015   The   Authors.

Adolescence   is  a  period  of   increased  health-risk  behavior, including  substance  use.  Adolescent  substance  use  is  common  and increases  in  prevalence  as  adolescents  move  through  high  school. National  estimates  indicate  that  20–30%  of  adolescents  have  used alcohol  or  other  drugs  by  9th  grade,  and  this  usage  increases to  50–70%  by  12th  grade  (Johnson  et  al.,  2014).  Although  some substance  use  in  adolescence  is  considered  within  the  range  of  normative  behavior,  adolescents  who  experiment  with  substance  use at  subclinical  levels  have  been  shown  to  exhibit  more  externalizing behaviors  (Ernst  et  al.,  2006a)  and  have  poorer  mental  health  and academic  outcomes  than  their  abstaining  peers  (Tucker  et  al.,  2006).  ∗ Corresponding  author  at:  Center  for  Mind  and  Brain,  267  Cousteau  Pl.,  Davis,  CA 95618,  United  States.

Substance  use  early  in  adolescence  confers  heightened  risk  for  not only  substance  use  disorders  but  also  other  mental  illnesses  in  later adolescence  and  adulthood  (Brook  et  al.,  2002).  Every  year  older that  adolescents  get  before  they  initiate  substance  use,  is  thought to  decrease  the  odds  of  substance  dependence  later  in  life  by  5–15% (DuRant  et  al.,  1999;  Grant  and  Dawson,  1997,  1998).  Early  substance  use  additionally  predicts  other  types  of  health  risk  behaviors during  adolescence,  such  as  reckless  driving  and  participation  in violent  or  criminal  activities  (Grant  et  al.,  2001;  Hingson  and  Zha, 2009),  rendering  it  a  critical  health  behavior,  whose  underlying mechanisms  warrant  further  investigation.  Identiﬁcation  of  the  neurobiological  components  associated with  substance  use  behaviors  allows  for  a  richer  understanding  of the  neural  underpinnings  of  developing  substance  use  problems that  can  be  used  to  inform  treatment  targets,  whether  behavioral  and/or  pharmacological.

Weissman  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  16  (2015)  121–129  context,  and  participant  engagement  (Biswal  et  al.,  1995).  The connections  between  brain  regions  measured  by  RSFC  may   be a  function  of  direct  communication  via  structural  connections, association  with  a  third  region,  and/or  long-term  patterns  of coordinated  activity  engaged  during  certain  behaviors  or  psychological  processes.  Functional  connectivity  can  be  positive  or negative,  reﬂecting  the  direction  of  correlation  in  regional  activity  patterns  (Hulvershorn  et  al.,  2014).  The  type  of  connectivity patterns  observed  indicates  the  nature  of  the  functional  relationship  between  these  regions.  Activity  of  functionally  related  and structurally  connected  networks  of  brain  regions  are  strongly  and positively  correlated  at  rest  (Damoiseaux  et  al.,  2006;  Yeo  et  al., 2011),  whereas  networks  with  opposing  functions  demonstrate strong  negative  correlations  (Fox  et  al.,  2005).  From  childhood  to adulthood,  negative  connectivity  increases  overall  as  neural  regions become  more  specialized  and  as  the  regulatory  inﬂuence  of  regions such  as  the  prefrontal  cortex  (PFC)  gains  more  control  (Fox  et  al., 2005;  Stevens  et  al.,  2009).  The  present  study  investigates  how  variations  in  connectivity  patterns  in  the  midst  of  these  developmental shifts  relate  to  adolescent  substance  use  behavior.  Recent  work  has  documented  age-related  shifts  in  nucleus accumbens  (NAcc)  connectivity,  suggesting  that  positive  connectivity  with  anterior  cingulate  cortex  (ACC)  and  anterior  insula  peaks during  adolescence,  then  declines  into  adulthood  (Porter  et  al., 2015).  These  patterns  relate  to  conceptual  frameworks  regarding the  role  of  neurodevelopment  in  shaping  adolescents’  motivated behavior.  The  triadic  model  (Ernst  et  al.,  2006b;  Ernst  and  Fudge, 2009)  hypothesizes  that  motivated  behavior  results  from  the  balance  between  three  inﬂuences:  (1)  reward  drive,  mediated  by  the NAcc,  a  region  within  the  striatum,  (2)  harm  avoidance,  mediated by  the  amygdala,  and  (3)  regulation  of  these  systems  by  the  PFC. Research  also  points  to  the  contribution  of  salience,  emotional or  cognitive,  mediated  by  the  insula  and  ACC,  in  shaping  motivated  behavior  (Seeley  et  al.,  2007).  Different  patterns  of  functional connectivity  between  and  functional  specialization  among  regions implicated  in  reward  drive  (e.g.,  NAcc),  avoidance  (e.g.  amygdala), salience  (e.g.  insula  and  ACC),  and  the  cognitive  control  of  the  above (e.g.,  PFC)  may   therefore  differentially  help  or  hinder  adolescents’ ability  to  regulate  their  substance  use  behaviors.  Individual  differences  in  NAcc  functional  connectivity  have  previously  been  associated  with  risk  for  substance  use  problems.  In a  RSFC  study  examining  family  history  as  a  risk  factor  for  later substance  abuse,  adolescents  with  no  family  history  of  alcoholism were  found  to  have  signiﬁcant  negative  correlations  between  NAcc and  ventrolateral  PFC  (vlPFC),  suggesting  more  segregation  and functional  calibration  between  these  reward-processing  and  regulatory  regions,  respectively,  whereas  adolescents  with  a  family history  of  alcoholism  demonstrated  this  relationship  to  a  much lesser  extent  (Cservenka  et  al.,  2014).  Because  a  family  history  of substance  dependence  is  a  known  risk  factor  for  substance  use problems  (Merikangas  et  al.,  1998),  these  ﬁndings  suggest  that  a lack  of  negative  connectivity  (i.e.,  a  positive  or  zero  correlation) between  NAcc  and  regions  of  PFC  during  adolescence  may   signal risk  for  later  addiction.  Adolescent  substance  use  occurs  during  a  period  in  which  the brain  undergoes  dramatic  maturation  and  reﬁnement  of  key  neural  pathways,  particularly  in  the  structural  connections  between the  PFC  and  subcortical  circuits  (Asato  et  al.,  2010).  These  changes are  widely  thought  to  contribute  to  the  onset  of  substance  use behavior  in  adolescence  (Spear,  2000;  Steinberg,  2007;  Casey  and Jones,  2010),  and  may   make  the  development  of  the  adolescent brain  all  the  more  vulnerable  to  the  negative  effects  of  substance use  (Lubman  et  al.,  2007).  A  number  of  neuroimaging  studies have  documented  differences  in  activation  in  both  striatal,  including  NAcc,  and  PFC  regions  both  preceding  and  following  onset of  heavy  substance  use  (Clark  et  al.,  2013;  Norman  et  al.,  2011;  Tapert  et  al.,  2007;  Schweinsburg  et  al.,  2005;  Squeglia  et  al., 2009).  Behavioral  tendencies  previously  found  to  confer  risk  for  substance  use  behavior,  such  as  high  levels  of  sensation  seeking  (SS) (Zuckerman  and  Link,  1968)  may   shed  further  light  on  how  neural connectivity  patterns  relate  to  substance  use  behavior.  Increased  SS has  been  shown  to  mediate  the  relation  between  earlier  pubertal development  and  increased  substance  use  behavior  across  adolescence  (Martin  et  al.,  2002).  In  adolescents  with  a  family  history of  alcoholism,  task-related  functional  connectivity  between  NAcc and  both  supplementary  sensorimotor  area  and  precuneus  was found  to  mediate  the  positive  relationship  between  sensation  seeking  and  alcohol  consumption  (Weiland  et  al.,  2013).  This  suggests that  increasing  substance  use  rates  in  adolescence  may  result  from increased  exploratory  tendencies,  driven  by  an  increase  in  the  optimal   level  of  arousal  that  adolescents  require  to  feel  motivated  and balanced  (Ernst  et  al.,  2006b;  Ernst  and  Fudge,  2009).  While  the  NAcc  is  of  particular  interest  in  understanding  the mechanisms  underlying  adolescent  substance  use,  other  regions, particularly  the  amygdala  and  PFC  have  also  been  demonstrated to  undergo  changes  in  functional  connectivity  during  adolescence.  Across  adolescence,  negative  connectivity  has  been  found to  increase  between  dorsolateral  PFC  (dlPFC),  a  region  within networks  especially  active  during  focused  attention  and  medial PFC,  a  region  within  the  default  mode  network,  which  is  especially active  at  rest  (Chai  et  al.,  2014).  Connectivity  between  amygdala and  medial  PFC  has  also  been  shown  to  switch  from  positive  to negative  during  adolescence  (Gee  et  al.,  2013).  The  goal  of  the  present  study  was   to  examine  the  interrelations among  adolescent  substance  use,  NAcc-based  RSFC,  and  sensation seeking.  We   conducted  the  current  study  with  a  sub-sample  of Mexican-origin  adolescent  participants  drawn  from  a  multigenerational  longitudinal  study  of  the  emergence  of  substance  use and  subsequent  addiction  problems.  Latinos  are  a  rapidly  growing  segment  of  the  population,  but  are  largely  underrepresented  in psychiatric  and  neuroscience  research  (Arnett,  2008;  Chiao,  2009), despite  evidence  for  higher  rates  of  substance  use  among  Latino adolescents  (Johnson  et  al.,  2014).  Nonetheless,  the  racial  and  cultural  homogeneity  of  the  current  Mexican-origin  sample  provides an  inherent  control  for  the  inﬂuence  of  race  and  ethnicity  and  provides  data  on  an  understudied  ethnic  group  while  producing  novel results  that  should  be  generalizable  to  and  replicable  within  other populations.  Three  aims  guided  the  current  study:  (1)  to  investigate the  relation  between  age  of  substance  use  onset  and  NAcc-based RSFC,  (2)  to  examine  whether  the  relation  between  SS  and  age  of substance  use  onset  relates  to  and  potentially  mediates  any  relation  between  NAcc-based  RSFC  and  age  of  substance  use  onset  (3) to  examine  the  speciﬁcity  of  the  role  of  NAcc  in  the  above  analyses by  also  exploring  amygdala-,  and  dlPFC-based  RSFC.  2.  Materials  and  method  2.1.  Participants  Participants  were  73  Mexican-origin  adolescents  (40  female, MAge =  16.26  years,  SD  =  0.50)  enrolled  in  a  functional  neuroimaging  sub-study  of  the  California  Families  Project  (CFP),  a  10-year, prospective,  longitudinal  study  of  risk  for  and  resilience  to  substance  use  problems.  Participants  in  the  main  CFP  study  included 674  single  and  two-parent  families  of  Mexican  origin  with  a  ﬁfth grade  child  (MAge =  10.85,  50.2%  female)  who   were  drawn  at  random  from  school  rosters  of  students  during  the  2006–2007  and 2007–2008  school  years.  Participants  in  the  parent  study  were ranked  based  on  the  number  of  items  endorsed  on  the  two  substance  use  scales  at  age  15.  Participants  for  the  neuroimaging  D.G.  Weissman  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  16  (2015)  121–129   123  study  were  randomly  drawn  from  the  top  (N  =  37)  and  bottom (N  =  36)  third  of  this  distribution,  excluding  any  adolescents  taking psychotropic  medications.  Four  adolescents  were  excluded  from analyses  due  to  excessive  movement  in  the  scanner,  resulting  in  a sample  of  69  youths  for  all  reported  analyses.  2.2.  Measures  2.2.1.  Substance  use                    .  .  .  Participants  reported  their  history  of  substance  use  using  the Alcohol,  Tobacco,  and  Other  Drugs  (ATOD)  survey  (Elliott  et  al., 1982)  at  each  annual  CFP  assessment  from  ages  10–16,  as  well as  on  the  day  of  the  MRI   visit  prior  to  turning  17.  This  measure, chosen  for  its  sensitivity  to  low  to  moderate  levels  of  use,  consists of  26  items  about  participants’  respective  use  of  cigarettes,  beer, wine  or  wine  coolers,  hard  liquor,  marijuana,  inhalants,  and  other drugs  as  well  as  their  experience  with  binge  drinking,  being  drunk on  alcohol,  or  being  high  on  drugs.  For  each  of  those  substances or  experiences,  they  were  asked,  “have  you  ever. .,”  and  if  yes, .,”  and  “in  the  last  3  months, then  asked  “at  what  age  did  you  ﬁrst. how  many  times  have  you. .”   Finally,  on  the  day  of  the  MRI   visit, an  Oralert  oral  saliva  drug  test  was  used  to  assess  the  presence  of substances  within  the  preceding  few  days  (Transmetron,  Salt  Lake City,  Utah).  Participants  who  tested  positive  were  asked  if  they  were currently  under  the  inﬂuence  of  the  drug.  If  they  reported  no,  they continued  with  the  scan  (100%).  Participants’  age  of  substance  use onset,  as  shown  in  Table  1,  was  determined  based  on  when  they ﬁrst  reported  having  used  any  substance,  or  presence  of  substance was  detected  in  saliva.  This  number  was  subtracted  from  17,  participants’  maximum  age  in  years  by  the  end  of  MRI   data  collection,  to calculate  years  since  substance  use  onset.  Years  since  substance  use onset  ranged  from  0  =  never  reported  having  used  substances,  no  substances  present  at  MRI   visit  to  7  =  reported  having  used  substances  for the  ﬁrst  time  at  age  10.   Frequency  of  use  in  the  3  months  preceding the  scan  was  scored  on  a  0–4  scale  (0  =  no  use,  1  =  less  than  once  per week,  2  =  once  per  week,  3  =  two  or  three  times  per  week,  4  =  almost every  day).  Participants  also  completed  the  substance  use  disorder section  of  the  Diagnostic  Interview  Schedule  for  Children-IV  (DISC, Shaffer  et  al.,  2000)  at  each  of  the  seven  annual  visits  to  determine  lifetime  diagnosis  for  substance  abuse  and  dependence.  Four adolescents  met   criteria  for  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  abuse.  Two  met criteria  for  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  dependence.  One  met   criteria  for marijuana  abuse,  and  one  met   criteria  for  marijuana  dependence. Finally,  one  adolescent  met   criteria  for  both  marijuana  and  alcohol abuse.  2.2.2.  Demographic  characteristics  and  psychiatric  symptoms  All  adolescents  in  the  CFP  completed  the  Woodcock-Johnson  III IQ  test  (Woodcock  et  al.,  2001)  on  the  ﬁrst  visit  in  ﬁfth  grade.  Parents of  adolescents  reported  education,  income  and  household  roster  at the  ﬁrst  visit,  which  was  then  used  to  calculate  socioeconomic  status  (SES,  See  Supplementary  Materials).  Participants  self-reported on  their  pubertal  development  using  the  Pubertal  Development Scale  (Petersen  et  al.,  1983).  The  scale  consisted  of  6  items  total (4  items  for  both  boys  and  girls,  then  2  items  per  gender  that  are speciﬁc  to  their  own  gender  development).  Tanner  stage  at  age 16  was  calculated  based  on  the  average  of  these  6  items  from  the visit  in  10th  grade.  Descriptive  statistics  are  summarized  in  Table  2. Participants  self-reported  symptoms  of  attention  deﬁcit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  anxiety,  depression,  conduct  disorder,  and oppositional  deﬁance,  based  on  the  DISC,  at  each  of  visit.  Two  participants  in  the  sample  met   criteria  for  conduct  disorder  in  10th grade.  No  other  participant  met   criteria  for  any  other  psychiatric disorder  (see  Supplementary  Materials  for  descriptive  statistics  of each  psychiatric  disorder).  2.2.3.  Sensation  seeking  ˛  The  Sensation  Seeking  Scale  (Zuckerman  and  Link,  1968),  completed  on  the  day  of  the  fMRI  scan,  consists  of  four  subscales with  10  items  each.  For  each  item,  participants  chose  between two  statements  that  reﬂected  high  or  low  sensation  seeking.  The four  subscales  were:  Thrill  and  Adventure  Seeking  (e.g.,  “I  often wish  I  could  be  a  mountain  climber”  versus  “I  can’t  understand people  who  risk  their  necks  climbing  mountains.”;    =  0.61);  Disinhibition  (e.g.,  “I  like  wild,  uninhibited  parties”  versus  “I  prefer quiet  parties  with  good  conversation.”;    =  0.77);  Experience  Seeking  (e.g.,  “people  should  dress  in  individual  ways,  even  if  the  effects are  sometimes  strange”  versus  “people  should  dress  according  to some  standard  of  taste,  neatness,  and  style”;    =  0.47);  and  Boredom  Susceptibility  (e.g.,  “I  can’t  stand  watching  a  movie  I’ve  seen before”  versus  “there  are  some  movies  I  enjoy  seeing  a  second  or even  a  third  time”;    =  0.56).  The  Disinhibition  subscale  contains  3 items  that  speciﬁcally  refer  to  substance  use  (e.g.,  “I  have  tried  marijuana  or  would  like  to”  versus  “I  would  never  smoke  marijuana”; ˛   =  0.69).  All  analyses  involving  the  total  SS  and  Disinhibition  scales were  conducted  both  with  (˛   =  0.67)  these substance-related  items.    =  0.77)  and  without  (˛  ˛  ˛  ˛  2.3.  Resting  state  fMRI  2.3.1.  Resting  state  scan  Participants  were  instructed  to  lie  still  and  relax  in  the  scanner for  several  minutes  with  their  eyes  opened  and  focused  on  a  white ﬁxation  cross  presented  on  a  black  screen  through  a  mirror  attached to  the  head  coil.  Resting  state  fMRI  data  were  collected  for  7  min 24  s.  2.3.2.  Image  acquisition  and  data  preprocessing  for   ×   3.5   The  scan  was  conducted  on  a  Siemens  3T  TIM  Trio  MRI scanner  with  a  32-channel  head  coil.  Parameters  image × acquisition  were  voxel  size  =  3.5    3.5  mm,   slices  =  35,  slice thickness  =  3.5  mm,   repetition  time  =  2000  ms,  echo  time  =  27  ms, ﬂip  angle  =  80  degrees,  interleaved  slice  geometry,  ﬁeld  of view  =  224  mm.   Images  were  T2  weighted.  The  ﬁrst  three  volumes were  discarded  to  ensure  magnet  stabilization.  Preprocessing  was conducted  using  the  FMRIB  Software  Library  (FSL)  (Smith  et  al., 2004)  and  Analysis  of  Functional  NeuroImaging  (AFNI)  software (Cox,  1996).  Preprocessing  consisted  of  slice  timing  correction, rigid  body  motion  correction  with  six  degrees  of  freedom,  and spatial  smoothing  with  a  6  mm  half-maximum  Gaussian  kernel. “Denoising”  of  the  data  was   accomplished  through  independent  component  analysis  using  FSL’s  MELODIC,  with  components rated  as  either  signal  or  noise  using  criteria  for  visual  inspection described  by  Kelly  et  al.  (2010).  The  noise  components  were  then ﬁltered  out  of  the  functional  data.  Each  participant’s  functional data  were  then  co-registered  with  their  brain-extracted  structural images  and  normalized  to  Montreal  Neurological  Institute  (MNI) stereotaxic  space  using  FSL’s  two-stage  registration  method  via FLIRT.  Alignment  was   visually  conﬁrmed  for  all  participants.  AFNI was  then  used  for  de-spiking,  band-pass  ﬁltering  above  0.1  Hz  and below  0.01  Hz,  and  censoring  of  volumes  with  head  motion  greater than  0.3  mm  from  the  previous  volume,  resulting  in  the  aforementioned  exclusion  of  four  participants  for  whom  censoring  resulted in  the  removal  of  more  than  44/220  volumes  (i.e.,  20%  of  the  data). As  such,  69  participants  were  included  in  the  analyses.  2.3.3.  Data  analysis  A  region  of  interest  (ROI)  based  on  bilateral  spheres  with  a  radius of  3.5  mm  each  was   created  at  the  locations  of  the  left  and  right −8)  based  on  prior  work NAcc  (MNI  coordinates:  x  =  (Di  Martino  et  al.,  2008).

Individual  spherical  ROIs  with  a  radius of  6  mm  were  created  at  the  location  of  left  and  right  dlPFC  (MNI ±40,  y  =  40,  z  =  24).  Correct  alignment  of  ROIs  was coordinates:  x  =  conﬁrmed  for  each  participant  by  visual  inspection.  The  average time  course  of  the  voxels  in  each  ROI  was  extracted  using  AFNI’s 3dmaskave  and  correlated  with  every  voxel  in  the  brain  for  each participant  using  AFNI’s  3dﬁm+.  These  correlation  coefﬁcients  were transformed  using  Fisher’s  z  transformation.  More  positive  values in  the  resulting  z-score  for  each  voxel  indicate  more  similarity between  the  BOLD  time  course  of  the  ROI  and  that  voxel,  while more  negative  values  indicate  anticorrelation  between  the  BOLD time  courses.  Based  on  AFNI’s  3dClustSim  program,  which  uses  Monte  Carlo simulations  to  determine  appropriate  cluster  sizes,  accounting  for the  number  of  voxels  and  a  6  mm  smoothing  kernel,  a  voxel-wise threshold  of  t  =  3.433,  p  =  0.001,  and  a  minimum  cluster  size  of  45 voxels  produced  an  overall  alpha  <0.01.  Regression  analysis  was conducted  using  AFNI’s  3dttest++  to  determine  the  effect  of  years since  substance  use  onset  on  the  z-transformed  correlation  maps representing  connectivity  for  each  ROI  for  each  participant.  3.  Results  3.1.  Associations  of  substance  use  onset  age  with  other  variables of  interest  Pearson  correlations  were  calculated  between  age  of  substance use  onset,  age  at  scan,  gender,  pubertal  status,  IQ,  SES,  self-reported substance  use  frequency  concurrent  to  the  scan,  lifetime  symptoms of  psychiatric  disorders,  and  sensation  seeking  subscales.  As  shown in  Table  3,  years  since  substance  use  onset  was  not  signiﬁcantly correlated  with  age,  gender,  pubertal  status  at  age  16,  IQ,  or  SES. Therefore,  these  variables  were  not  included  as  covariates  in  the resting  state  analysis.  Years  since  substance  use  onset  was   significantly  correlated  with  conduct  disorder  symptoms,  oppositional deﬁance  symptoms,  ADHD  symptoms,  and  depression  symptoms  (see  Supplementary  Materials).  Years  since  substance  use  onset  signiﬁcantly  correlated  with  the  Thrill  and  Adventure  seeking  subscale of  SS  and  to  a  greater  extent  with  the  Disinhibition  subscale  score.  3.2.  Years  since  substance  use  onset  and  RSFC  Five  regions  demonstrated  a  signiﬁcant  positive  relation between  the  number  of  years  since  age  10  that  adolescents  had engaged  in  substance  use  and  the  strength  of  connectivity  with  the NAcc.  As  shown  in  Table  4  and  Fig.  1,  the  earlier  that  adolescents initiated  substance  use,  the  more  positive  the  connectivity  between bilateral  NAcc  and  right  pre-supplementary  motor  area  (pre-SMA), right  dorsolateral  PFC  (dlPFC),  right  dorsomedial  PFC  (dmPFC), right  inferior  parietal  lobule  (IPL),  and  left  medial  temporal  gyrus (MTG).  These  clusters  remained  signiﬁcant  when  conducting  separate  analyses  excluding  participants  who  had  tested  positive  for marijuana  in  saliva,  and  excluding  participants  who  met   subclinical criteria  for  conduct  disorder.  As  shown  in  Table  5,  six  regions  demonstrated  a  signiﬁcant  relation  between  the  number  of  years  since  age  10  that  adolescents had  engaged  in  substance  use  and  the  strength  of  connectivity with  the  right  dlPFC.  Examining  the  overall  connectivity  of  these regions  with  right  dlPFC,  independent  of  substance  use,  revealed that  three  clusters  had  overall  negative  connectivity  with  right dlPFC,  and  three  clusters  had  overall  positive  connectivity  with right  dlPFC.  Right  ACC,  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex,  and  right dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  had  overall  negative  connectivity with  right  dlPFC,  but  the  connectivity  was  less  negative  the  earlier that  adolescents  initiated  substance  use.  Two  clusters  in  right  and left  dlPFC  and  another  in  the  right  lingual  gyrus  demonstrated  overall  positive  connectivity  with  right  dlPFC,  and  the  connectivity  was more  positive  the  earlier  that  adolescents  initiated  substance  use. In  addition,  a  single  cluster  in  right  ACC  demonstrated  signiﬁcantly less  negative  connectivity  with  left  dlPFC  the  younger  adolescents were  when  they  ﬁrst  engaged  in  substance  use.  D.G.

In  contrast  to  results  for  the  NAcc  and  dlPFC  seeds,  no  regions demonstrated  signiﬁcant  relations  between  age  of  substance  use onset  and  connectivity  with  the  amygdala  seed.  There  was  no  signiﬁcant  relation  between  substance  use  frequency  concurrent  with  the  fMRI  scan  and  NAcc  connectivity.  Thus, there  was  no  justiﬁcation  for  investigating  whether  RSFC  differences  related  to  substance  use  frequency  could  explain  the  relation between  RSFC  and  number  of  years  using  substances.  Neither  overall  SS  nor  Disinhibition  demonstrated  a  signiﬁcant relation  to  NAcc  RSFC.  Thus,  there  was  no  justiﬁcation  for  investigating  whether  RSFC  differences  related  to  SS  could  explain  the relation  between  number  of  years  using  substances  and  RSFC.  Due to  the  lack  of  a  relation  between  amygdala  RSFC  and  substance  use, amygdala  RSFC  was  not  investigated  with  regard  to  SS.  4.  Discussion  This  study  was  designed  to  determine  the  relation  between the  age  of  substance  use  onset  across  early  to  middle  adolescence and  the  intrinsic  connections  of  the  brain’s  reward  circuitry.  A robust  and  consistent  relation  was  observed,  such  that  the  earlier adolescents  initiated  substance  use,  the  greater  the  coordinated  activity  of  bilateral  NAcc  and  ﬁve  neural  regions:  right  pre-SMA, right  dlPFC,  right  dmPFC,  right  IPL,  and  left  MTG.  This  pattern is  striking  in  both  expected  and  novel  ways.  First,  the  relations between  NAcc  connectivity  with  each  of  the  ﬁve  other  regions  and years  since  substance  use  onset  were  consistent,  whereby  a  linear  increase  in  NAcc  connectivity  with  these  regions  corresponded with  every  year  earlier  that  the  adolescents  initiated  substance use.  Second,  these  right  hemisphere  regions  have  been  shown  in previous  research  to  be  strongly  connected  to  one  another  both functionally  and  structurally,  and  to  be  primary  nodes  in  what  has commonly  been  called  the  right  fronto-parietal  control  network (Fassbender  et  al.,  2006;  Seeley  et  al.,  2007;  Nindam  et  al.,  2012). Co-activation  of  the  regions  in  this  network  has  been  observed in  resting  state  studies  (Damoiseaux  et  al.,  2006;  Spreng  et  al., 2013)  as  well  as  during  performance  of  a  variety  of  tasks  requiring  cognitive  control  (Fassbender  et  al.,  2006;  Seeley  et  al.,  2007). Right  dlPFC  and  right  IPL  in  particular  have  been  implicated  as  the common  brain  regions  involved  in  a  wide  range  of  executive  functions  requiring  top-down  attentional  control  (Fassbender  et  al., 2006).  They  are  therefore  considered  to  constitute  a  network  of intrinsically  connected  regions  that  generally  subserve  cognitive control.  126   D.G.  Weissman  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  16  (2015)  121–129  Fig.  1.  Points  on  the  scatter  plots  depict  the  Z-transformed  correlations  of  the  voxel  time  courses  within  each  signiﬁcant  cluster  with  the  NAcc  time  course,  averaged  across the   voxels  in  each  cluster,  and  plotted  against  years  since  age  10  of  substance  use  onset  for  each  participant.  B  =  Regression  coefﬁcient  for  the  relation  between  years  since onset  of  use  and  NAcc-Cluster  connectivity,  R  Pre-SMA/dlPFC  =  Right  pre-supplementary  motor  area,  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex;  R  IPL  =  Right  inferior  parietal  lobule;  R dmPFC   =  Right  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex;  R  dlPFC  =  Right  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex,  L  MTG   =  Left  middle  temporal  gyrus.  Our  results  suggest  that  earlier  onset  of  substance  use  relates to  greater  integration  of  striatal  and  right  frontoparietal  networks, and  thereby  a  stronger  coupling  of  the  brain’s  reward  and  cognitive control  mechanisms.  This  increased  between-network  coupling may  not  be  speciﬁc  to  reward  and  cognitive  control  networks, however.  More  years  of  substance  use  was  also  associated  with increased  connectivity  between  dlPFC  and  several  regions  within prefrontal  cortex,  a  pattern  that  runs  counter  to  the  developmental  trajectory  typically  seen  across  adolescence  toward  more segregation  of  neural  networks  that  underpin  opposing  or  complementary  functions  (Chai  et  al.,  2014;  Fox  et  al.,  2005;  Stevens  et  al.,  2009).  The  patterns  of  increased  interconnectivity  between dlPFC  and  other  prefrontal  regions,  particularly  ACC,  are  strikingly similar  to  those  found  in  cocaine-dependent  adults  (Camchong et  al.,  2011;  Cisler  et  al.,  2013).  This  suggests  that  a  lack  of segregation  between  cognitive  control  regions  and  other  brain networks  may   be  related  to  the  duration  of  substance  exposure and  risk  for  future  substance  use  problems.  Finally,  amygdala  did not  show  any  signiﬁcant  connectivity  with  any  other  regions, lending  support  to  the  speciﬁcity  of  reward  processing  and  cognitive  control  circuitry  connections  to  the  adolescent  substance  use phenotype.  D.G.  Weissman  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  16  (2015)  121–129   127  Increased  coupling  between  reward  and  cognitive  control regions  is  consistent  with  research  demonstrating  that  monetary  incentives  improved  performance  and  increased  activation in  frontoparietal  control  networks  during  cognitive  control  tasks for  adolescents  with  substance  use  disorder,  relative  to  healthy controls  (Chung  et  al.,  2011).  A  stronger  coupling  of  reward  and  cognitive  control  networks  may   suggest  a  strong  inﬂuence  of  external appetitive  motivators  on  goal-directed  neural  activity.  Alternatively,  increased  connectivity  between  NAcc  and  the  frontoparietal network  may   represent  a  compensatory  mechanism  by  which those  that  have  longer  lifetime  use  of  substances  recruit  normative levels  of  cognitive  control  behavior  when  required.  Greater  connectivity  between  NAcc  and  the  right  frontoparietal  network  does  not  appear  to  be  a  neural  signature  of  sensation seeking.  Although  strongly  correlated  with  the  number  of  years since  substance  use  onset,  neither  Sensation  Seeking  nor  Disinhibition  was  associated  with  NAcc-based  RSFC;  thus,  NAcc-based RSFC  could  not  mediate  the  link  between  SS  and  earlier  adolescent substance  use.  SS  is  by  no  means  an  exhaustive  measure  of  the  psychosocial  tendencies  that  predispose  adolescents  to  early  substance use  onset,  and  previous  studies  have  failed  to  ﬁnd  a  connection between  SS  and  neurodevelopmental  trajectories  in  adolescence thought  to  underlie  risk-taking  (Mills  et  al.,  2014).  Nonetheless, these  ﬁndings  suggest  that  NAcc  functional  connectivity  with the  right  frontoparietal  control  network  is  related  to  adolescent substance  use  behavior,  irrespective  of  its  association  with  a  preexisting  tendency  to  pursue  rewards.  A  more  likely  explanation may   therefore  be  that  substance  use  during  adolescence  engages NAcc  and  the  right  frontoparietal  network  in  tandem,  perhaps  especially  as  behavior  is  regulated  toward  the  pursuit  of  rewards  such as  substances,  and  the  earlier  that  substance  use  takes  place,  the stronger  the  coactivations  become.  This  connectivity  pattern  may therefore  be  one  mechanism  by  which  early  adolescent  substance use  alters  brain  function  and  contributes  to  the  development  of substance  use  disorders.  Some  important  limitations  must  be  considered  in  interpreting the  current  ﬁndings.  First,  the  single  time-point  of  fMRI  data  collection  leaves  the  direction  of  causality  undetermined.  Structural  and functional  differences  in  the  brains  of  adolescent  substance  users have  been  identiﬁed  both  before  and  after  the  initiation  of  substance  use  (Squeglia  et  al.,  2009).  It  is  unknown  from  the  present study’s  results  whether  differences  in  connectivity  preceded  and contributed  to  earlier  substance  use,  or  vice  versa.  To  address  this issue,  longitudinal  study  of  adolescents’  neurodevelopment  and substance  use  into  adulthood  is  essential.  These  efforts  should  also assess  other  psychosocial  tendencies  and  behaviors  related  to  substance  use  and  risk-taking  as  potential  mediators  of  brain-behavior relationships  in  order  to  more  rigorously  characterize  the  nature of  their  causal  relationship.  In  fact,  the  participants  in  this  study will  continue  to  be  followed  annually,  and  data  on  their  substance use  behavior  and  psychosocial  tendencies  will  be  collected  into adulthood.  Second,  although  the  use  of  MNI   standard  space,  based  on  adult brains,  is  common  practice  in  studies  of  adolescent  brain  function (Stevens  et  al.,  2009;  Cservenka  et  al.,  2014;  Chung  et  al.,  2011), and  we  visually  conﬁrmed  localization  of  all  ROI  seeds,  the  appropriateness  of  using  the  adult  brain  to  normalize  and  locate  ROIs on  adolescent  brains  remains  open  to  debate  (Muzik  et  al.,  2000). Future  research  might  create  and  employ  the  use  of  a  template based  on  the  adolescent  brain  to  study  substance  use  in  adolescent samples.  Third,  despite  there  being  a  wide  range  of  substances,  substances  were  treated  as  a  general  category  in  connectivity  analyses. Given  the  high  degree  of  overlap  in  substance  usage  and  the  small number  of  adolescents  engaging  in  the  use  of  substances  other  than alcohol  and  marijuana,  the  present  study  was  underpowered  to  test  for  NAcc-based  RSFC  differences  related  to  speciﬁc  drugs,  which should  be  addressed  in  future  work.  Moreover,  future  researchers should  note  the  comorbidity  of  alcohol  and  marijuana  use  when investigating  the  speciﬁc  effects  of  either  substance.  Furthermore,  our  measure  of  age  of  onset  suggests  different  time windows  over  which  participants  had  engaged  in  substance  use. This  was  found  to  more  strongly  relate  to  NAcc-based  RSFC  than concurrent  frequency  of  use.  However,  other  approaches  to  operationalizing  substance  use  across  all  these  years  could  contribute to  variations  in  the  consequences  for  neural  functioning.  Further investigations  could  attempt  to  identify  particular  developmental windows  in  which  onset,  duration,  and  frequency  of  use  may   be differentially  inﬂuential  on  neural  functioning.  The  current  study  suggests  other  new  avenues  for  future  work. First,  the  right  lateralization  of  these  functional  connectivity  patterns  for  the  NAcc  seed  as  well  as  the  more  profuse  prefrontal interconnectivity  differences  for  the  right  versus  the  left  dlPFC  seed raise  questions  for  future  investigation.  Although  left  and  right frontoparietal  control  networks  frequently  demonstrate  coactivity during  cognitive  control  (Seeley  et  al.,  2007;  Niendam  et  al.,  2012), the  right  and  left  frontoparietal  control  networks  have  also  been found  to  be  dissociable  functional  networks  (Damoiseaux  et  al., 2006;  Yeo  et  al.,  2011;  Spreng  et  al.,  2013).  It  is  unclear  what  it is  about  adolescent  substance  use  that  would  speciﬁcally  promote greater  connectivity  with  the  right,  and  not  the  left,  frontoparietal  control  network.  Further  research  is  necessary  to  investigate the  functional  speciﬁcity  of  these  regions,  their  connectivity  with striatum,  and  their  relation  to  substance  use.  A  growing  body  of  research  connects  aberrant  RSFC  with  adolescent  psychopathology,  including  anxiety  symptoms  and  disorders (Burghy  et  al.,  2012;  Roy  et  al.,  2013),  depression  (Cullen  et  al., 2009),  attention-deﬁcit/hyperactive  disorder  (Sripada  et  al.,  2014), and  now,  with  the  present  study,  substance  use.  With  continued investigation  and  replication,  RSFC  shows  promise  as  a  method for  identifying  the  mechanisms  by  which  early  adolescent  substance  use  may   lead  to  later  substance  abuse  and  dependence, and  as  a  unique  indicator  of  risk,  with  the  potential  to  reﬂect underlying  genetic  and  developmental  variability  in  neurotransmission.  Indeed,  NAcc-PFC  RSFC  has  been  linked  with  genotypic differences  impacting  dopamine  neurotransmission  (Gordon  et  al., 2015,  2012),  an  increase  in  which  is  thought  to  lead  to  increased incentive  motivation  in  adolescence  (Luciana  et  al.,  2012).  As  such, examining  RSFC  as  an  endophenotype  may   be  applied  to  future work  focused  on  understanding  risk  from  genotype  to  phenotype. Incorporating  a  multi-level  perspective  on  the  genetic  and  neurobiological  contributors  to  the  development  of  substance  use  disorders into  translational  efforts  has  the  potential  to  lead  to  transformative prevention  and  intervention  efforts.  5.  Conclusion  The  earlier  substance  use  was  initiated  in  adolescence,  the stronger  the  coupling  between  NAcc  and  brain  regions  that  make  up the  right  frontoparietal  network,  a  network  known  to  be  involved in  cognitive  control,  as  well  as  increased  interconnectivity  between dlPFC  and  other  PFC  regions.  These  patterns  occurred  independently  of  the  equally  strong  relations  between  the  age  of  substance use  onset  and  disinhibition,  and  age  of  substance  use  onset  and  substance  use  frequency.  Because  of  the  strong  connection  between age  of  substance  use  onset  and  later  substance  abuse  and  dependence,  these  ﬁndings  suggest  that  connectivity  between  reward  and cognitive  control  networks  may   serve  as  a  mechanism  inﬂuencing  the  transition  to  substance  abuse  and  dependence.  This  study demonstrates  the  utility  of  seed-based  resting  state  functional  connectivity  analyses  in  improving  our  understanding  of  variations  128   D.G.  Weissman  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  16  (2015)  121–129  in  neural  functioning  that  underlie  psychiatric  illness,  indicating its  burgeoning  potential  in  the  identiﬁcation  of  risk  and  targeted intervention.

Miltner  Background: The aim of this study was to identify brain activation to socially threatening stimuli in social phobic subjects during different experimental conditions. Methods: With event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, brain activation to photographs and schematic pictures depicting angry or neutral facial expressions was measured in social phobic subjects and healthy control subjects, while subjects assessed either emotional expression (angry vs. neutral; explicit task) or picture type (photographic vs. schematic; implicit task). Results: Compared with control subjects, phobics showed greater responses to angry than to neutral photographic faces in the insula regardless of task, whereas amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and extrastriate visual cortex were more strongly activated only during the implicit task. Phobics, in contrast to control subjects, showed similar activation patterns during both tasks. For schematic angry versus neutral faces, activation of insula and extrastriate visual cortex was found in phobics, but not in control subjects, during both tasks. Conclusions: Differences between social phobics and control subjects in brain responses to socially threatening faces are most pronounced when facial expression is task-irrelevant. Phobics intensively process angry (photographic as well as schematic) facial expressions, regardless of whether this is required. The insula plays a unique role in the processing of threat signals by social phobics.  Key Words: Social phobia, fMRI, insula, emotion, task conditions  S ocial phobia is characterized by fear of social interactions  and includes a hypersensitivity to signals of social threat, such as angry facial expressions (e.g., Lundh and Öst 1996; Mogg and Bradley 2002; for reviews see Bell et al 1999; Heinrichs and Hofmann 2001; Li et al 2001). In the search for neuronal correlates of this disorder, several functional imaging studies have demonstrated anomalies in responses of the amygdala in social phobics. By means of positron emission tomography (PET), increased amygdalar cerebral blood flow during real or anticipated public speaking was shown in social phobics compared with healthy control subjects (Furmark et al 2002; Tillfors et al 2001, 2002). With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), increased activation of the amygdala was found in social phobics in response to pictures depicting angry and contemptuous (Stein et al 2002) or neutral facial expressions (Birbaumer et al 1998; Veit et al 2002) and during classical conditioning (Schneider et al 1999). These results support the widely recognized role of the amygdala in the processing of threat-relevant stimuli (Büchel and Dolan 2000; LeDoux 1998; Öhman and Mineka 2001).  In contrast to the results for the amygdala, the involvement of further brain areas in the processing of socially threatening stimuli is less clear. Recently, a block design fMRI study with social phobics found increased activation of medial temporal lobe areas, including the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), specifically to angry  From the Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology (TS, I-TK, MG, WHRM) and the Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology (H-JM), Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany.

Received June 15, 2004; revised September 17, 2004; accepted September  22, 2004.  0006-3223/04/$30.00 doi:10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.09.024  and contemptuous faces (Stein et al 2002). The enhanced responsiveness of these areas was interpreted to reflect increased emotional processing of threatening faces. Remarkably, there was no evidence of increased activation in other brain areas that are supposed to be important for the processing of threatening visual stimuli and the mediation of fear, such as the insula or extrastriate visual cortex (for reviews see Critchley 2003; Haxby et al 2002; Phan et al 2002). For example, in a recent eventrelated fMRI study, we found a significant response of the insula to phobia-relevant pictures in animal phobics (Dilger et al 2003). Rauch et al (1997) demonstrated insula activation during symptom provocation across different anxiety disorders (obsessivecompulsive disorder, simple phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder). Current theories propose a special role of the insula for emotional experiences, especially in relation to sensed dangers (Critchley 2003; Damasio et al 2000).  Furthermore, studies with healthy subjects showed a strong influence of the emotional valence of visual stimuli, such as facial expressions, on activation of extrastriate visual cortex. Most consistently, enhanced responses to unpleasant versus neutral faces were described in the fusiform gyrus (e.g., Keightley et al 2003; Vuilleumier et al 2001; Winston et al 2003) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) (e.g., LaBar et al 2003; Narumoto et al 2001; Winston et al 2002, 2003). The posterior fusiform gyrus is strongly involved in face detection and recognition (e.g., Joseph 2001; Kanwisher et al 1997; Vuilleumier et al 2003), and the posterior STS is implicated in the evaluation of the social relevance of stimuli (for reviews, see Allison et al 2000; Haxby et al 2002). The specific involvement of these areas in the processing of social threat signals in social phobics remains to be elucidated.  The present study aimed at a detailed examination of brain activation to angry versus neutral facial expressions in social phobics by using 1) an event-related fMRI design; 2) a priori– defined brain regions of interest (ROIs); 3) different kinds of facial pictures; and 4) different task instructions.  Event-related designs permit the presentation of stimuli in random order and, therefore, a reduction of anticipation effects. Furthermore, they represent adequate experimental designs for  BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2004;56:921–930 © 2004 Society of Biological Psychiatry  922 BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2004;56:921–930  T. Straube et al  Figure 1. Examples of stimuli.

Besides these advantages, event-related designs, however, show a decreased sensitivity in the detection of functional activation compared with block designs (Liu and Frank 2004).  The ROIs were selected a priori to increase the chance of detecting significant responses in brain areas that have been shown to be involved in the processing of threatening visual information in healthy control subjects or phobic subjects, such as DMPFC, insula, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and STS (e.g., Critchley et al 2002; Dilger et al 2003; Keightley et al 2003; Paquette et al 2003; Stein et al 2002; Vuilleumeir et al 2001; Winston et al 2003).  Besides photographs of faces, we presented schematic facial pictures. The schematic faces used were prototypic line drawings of facial expressions, which provide enough information for the recognition of emotional expression (Öhman et al 2001). We examined whether such simplified stimuli elicit differential brain responses in social phobics relative to healthy control subjects and whether potential effects, such as specific activations in amygdala, insula, or extrastriate areas, correspond to results found for photographic faces.  Most importantly, we varied the task condition. In healthy subjects, task conditions have been demonstrated to affect brain activation to emotional stimuli (e.g., Critchley et al 2000; Keightley et al 2003; Lange et al 2003). Gur et al (2002) showed that task instructions that focused attention either to the emotional expression or to nonemotional aspects (gender) of faces led to taskspecific anomalies in brain activation of schizophrenic patients compared with healthy control subjects (hypoactivation in limbic areas in patients during the emotional task). Accordingly, we used two task conditions to modify the focus of attention. In the first condition, subjects had to attend explicitly to the emotional expression of faces (explicit task), whereas the second condition, which required identifying whether the stimulus was photographic or schematic, did not refer to the emotional content of stimuli (implicit task). Thus, we were able to examine the influence of the distinction between task-relevant and task-irrelevant threat stimuli on brain activation to these stimuli in social phobics compared with healthy control subjects.  Methods and Materials  Subjects  Ten subjects with social phobia (six female, four male; mean [SD] age 25.0 [3.3] years) and 10 healthy control subjects (six female, four male; aged 23.2 [3.9] years), all right-handed, provided written informed consent to volunteer in the study. All experimental procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Jena. The participants were recruited by newspaper advertisement and by public announcements to the university student population. Subjects received 6 Euro per hour  www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych  for participation. In addition, social phobics were offered a 10-session group training to improve their social competence (Hinsch and Pfingsten 2002). Fifty-four potential social phobic interview. subjects were screened by means of a personal According to the outcomes of a structured clinical interview (Wittchen et al 1997), 10 participants met the criteria of DSM-IV for social phobia but had no history of other Axis I or II disorders. Furthermore, accepted subjects had never received psychotropic medication, were not in therapy, and did not have any other major medical disorder. Their average score on the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI; Turner et al 1989; German version, Fydrich 2002) was 89.7 (5.95). Control subjects, who were matched for age, gender, and level of education, had no current diagnosis or previous history of major disorders according to DSM-IV criteria. Their average score on the SPAI was 28.47 (12.83). Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (German version, Hautzinger et al 1995) were higher in phobics than in control subjects (10.3 [6.5] vs. 3.9 [3.75]; t ⫽ 2.6; p ⬍ .05) but far below scores of clinical relevance.  Stimuli and Tasks  In the magnetic resonance scanner, subjects were exposed to pictures of photographic and schematic faces with either an angry or a neutral expression. The photographic faces comprised nine male and nine female faces, all Caucasian, and were taken facial expression stimuli from a standardized battery of (MacBrain Face Stimulus Set [see http://www.macbrain.org/ faces/#faces]; see Figure 1 for examples). The set contained two pictures of each individual, one depicting an angry and one a neutral facial expression. The computer-generated schematic pictures of an angry and a neutral face (see Figure 1) were similar to those used by Öhman et al (2001). For each task condition, all photographic face stimuli were used twice, and each of the schematic faces was used 36 times, resulting in 36 faces for each category of facial expression (neutral photographic, angry photographic, neutral schematic, angry schematic). All faces were presented against the same grey background. Pictures were shown in random order with a back-projection screen on an overhead mirror for 1 sec each, with a stimulus onset asynchrony of 3.45 sec. Additionally, 36 null events (a fixation cross indistinguishable from the fixation cross seen during the interstimulus intervals; see Josephs and Henson 1999) were randomly intermixed into the run. Pictures were presented under two task conditions. In condition one, subjects were asked to determine whether a photographic or a schematic face was shown. In condition two, subjects had to decide which emotional expression (angry or neutral) was depicted in the picture. For judgment, subjects pressed one of two buttons of an optic fiber response box with either the first or the middle finger of the right hand. Accuracy of judgment was measured with Experimental Runtime System software (version 3.29; BeriSoft Corporation, Frankfurt/ Main, Germany). Order of tasks, the two randomization schemes  T.

After the fMRI session, participants rated all pictures according to a Likert scale, with nine choices to assess valence (1 ⫽ very unpleasant to 9 ⫽ very pleasant) and arousal (1 ⫽ not arousing to 9 ⫽ very arousing).  Reaction times, accuracy of task performance, and ratings were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with SPSS software (version 10; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois). A probability level of p ⬍ .05 was considered statistically significant. All data presented in the text are expressed as means ⫾ SEM. For analysis of reaction times and accuracy, two subjects of each group had to be excluded due to technical problems during registration of button presses.  fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis  Scanning was performed in a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner (“Vision Plus”; Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). After acquisition of a high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical volume (192 slices, echo time [TE] ⫽ 6 msec, matrix ⫽ 256 ⫻ 256, voxel size ⫽ 1 ⫻ 1 ⫻ 1 mm), two runs (one per task) of T2*-weighted echo-planar images (EPIs) were measured (TE ⫽ 60 msec, flip angle ⫽ 90°, matrix ⫽ 64 ⫻ 64, field of view ⫽ 192 mm, repetition time ⫽ 2.3 sec). Each run comprised 275 volumes of 20 axial slices (thickness ⫽ 4 mm, gap ⫽ 1 mm, in-plane resolution ⫽ 3 ⫻ 3 mm). The volumes were acquired parallel to the lateral sulcus and covered the a priori–defined ROIs. Before imaging, a shimming procedure to improve field homogeneity was performed. Visual inspection of the EPI data revealed signal loss due to susceptibility artefacts in the inferior parts of the frontal cortex as well as in the anterior parts of the medial temporal lobe. These regions were not included in data analysis. The first four volumes of each run were discarded from analysis to ensure that steady-state tissue magnetization was reached.  Preprocessing and analysis of the functional data was performed with Brain Voyager 2000 software (version 4.9; Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). The volumes were realigned to the first volume to minimize the effects of head movements on data analysis. Further data preprocessing comprised a correction for slice time errors and spatial (8-mm full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel) as well as temporal (high pass filter: 5 cycles per run) smoothing. Anatomical and functional images were coregistered and normalized to the Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux 1988). Statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression of the signal time course at each voxel. The expected blood oxygen level– dependent (BOLD) signal change for each event type  (⫽ predictor) was modeled by a canonical hemodynamic response function (modified ␥ function; ␦ ⫽ 2.5, ␶ ⫽ 1.25). Withinand between-group statistical comparisons were conducted with a mixed-effect analysis, which considers intersubject variance and permits population-level inferences. In the first step, voxelwise statistical maps were generated, and the relevant, planned contrasts of predictor estimates (␤ weights) were computed for each individual. In the second step, group analysis of these individual contrasts was performed with t tests. The results of the analysis were considered statistically significant for t values with p ⬍ .005 within the a priori– defined ROIs. A cluster threshold of 50 contiguously activated voxels (interpolated, isotropic 1 mm) was used to minimize false-positive results. The following ROIs were defined a priori: DMPFC, insula, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior fusiform gyrus (from y ⫽ ⫺30), and STS. The ROIs were defined with Talairach daemon (http://ric.uthscsa.edu/ projects/talairachdaemon.html), except for the amygdala and the STS. The amygdala was defined according to our previous study with phobic subjects (sphere of 9 mm; see Dilger et al 2003) and the posterior STS according to the suggestions by Winston et al (2003) (sphere of 12 mm).

These results indicate that subjects rated the schematic angry face as more arousing and as more unpleasant than the neutral schematic face. In addition, phobics, compared with control subjects, rated the schematic angry face as significantly more arousing (5.3 ⫾ .6 vs. 3.6 ⫾ .6; t ⫽ 2.1, p ⬍ .05; Figure 2C) and unpleasant (2.4 ⫾ .3 vs. 4.1 ⫾ .3; t ⫽ 3.9, p ⬍ .01; Figure 2D).

For the implicit task, the contrast angry versus neutral faces revealed pronounced differences between phobics and control subjects (see Table 1). Several brain regions were activated in phobics but not control subjects. These areas comprised left and right insula, left and right amygdala, left fusiform gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and right STS (Table 2; see Figure 3 for insula activation). Right fusiform gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and left STS were activated in both phobics and control subjects (Table 2). Between-group comparisons revealed greater brain responses in phobics relative to control subjects in all ROIs, except in the DMPFC and the left amygdala (Table 2; see Figure 4 for responses in fusiform gyrus and STS).  During the explicit task, activation to angry versus neutral faces was found in both phobics and control subjects in all ROIs (Table 3). Between-group comparisons for this task revealed that phobics showed stronger BOLD responses in the left and right insula than control subjects (Table 3). Therefore, the insula was the only region where phobics had significantly greater responses than control subjects, regardless of task condition (Tables 2 and 3; Figure 3). For neither of the tasks was there any ROI indicating stronger activation in control subjects compared with phobics.  Furthermore, we performed within-group comparisons that explored intertask differences in activation to angry versus neutral faces. In control subjects, these contrasts revealed stronger activation in nearly all ROIs in the explicit relative to the implicit task. In phobics, this effect was restricted to the right parahippocampal gyrus (Table 4), indicating that phobics showed similarly strong activations regardless of task condition. For neither of the groups was there any ROI indicating increased activation in the implicit compared with the explicit task.  Schematic Faces. For the implicit task, no differential activation to angry versus neutral faces was found in control subjects in any ROI (Table 5). In contrast, phobics demonstrated activation of the right insula and left STS (Table 5; Figures 5 and 6). Activation in the left STS was significantly greater in phobics compared with control subjects (Table 5).  Under the explicit condition, control subjects showed activation to angry versus neutral faces in the left DMPFC (Table 5). In phobics, activations were found in the right DMPFC, left insula, and left fusiform gyrus (Table 5; see Figures 5 and 6 for responses in the insula and fusiform gyrus). Compared with control subjects, activation in the right DMPFC and left fusiform gyrus was significantly greater (Table 5).  Within-group comparisons regarding intertask differences revealed that control subjects had stronger activations in left DMPFC under the explicit compared with the implicit condition (Table 5).  There was no amygdalar activation to schematic faces in phobics. Additional analysis revealed that schematic faces led to strong habituation effects. Examination of the time course of  Figure 3.

Discussion  We found in phobics relative to control subjects greater responses to photographic angry versus neutral faces in the insula regardless of task, whereas the amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and STS showed increased activation only during the implicit task. Furthermore, under both task conditions, phobics exhibited similarly strong brain responses, suggesting that angry facial expressions were intensively processed even when this was not required.  Phobic subjects also responded sensitively to schematic faces and showed, in contrast to control subjects, significant activation in the insula and extrastriate cortex during both tasks. Although only responses in extrastriate cortex were significantly increased in phobics compared with control subjects, it remains remark www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych  926 BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2004;56:921–930  T. Straube et al  vance of the photographic as well as the schematic angry faces for social phobics. In addition, valence of the schematic angry face was rated as significantly more unpleasant by phobics than by control subjects, suggesting a specific emotional significance; however, behavioral and fMRI data for schematic faces are only partially comparable. In contrast to the repeated presentation during the scanning session (leading to strong habituation effects), schematic faces were shown only once during the ratings. The consistent results for the insula suggest a crucial role of this brain area in the processing of socially threatening signals in social phobics. The insular cortex has been shown to be generally involved in the recognition and experience of aversive states, such as disgust, fear, or pain (e.g., Dilger et al 2003; Peyron et al 2002; Phillips et al 1997). Critchley et al (2001, 2002; see for review Critchley 2003) provided strong evidence that the insula might support the interaction of perceived threat signals and bodily states of arousal leading to emotional experiences. This is consistent with the currently influential hypothesis that the insula is involved in monitoring the emotion-relevant physiological state of the individual (Damasio et al 2000). In line with such an evaluative function of the insula, recent studies with healthy subjects demonstrated enhanced insula activation to threatening faces when subjects were explicitly instructed to process the facial expressions (e.g., Anderson et al 2003; Gorno-Tempini et al 2001; Winston et al 2003; but see Lange et al 2003). In the present study, the same phenomenon was observed for control subjects, whereas phobics seemed intensively to evaluate the threat relevance of angry faces regardless of task condition.  Previous functional  imaging studies with phobic patients show inconsistent findings concerning insula activation. Significantly increased activation of the insula associated with provocation of anxiety symptoms was reported by Rauch et al (1997), who used pooled data across different anxiety disorders (obsessive-compulsive disorder, simple phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder). A specific involvement of the insula has also been described in spider phobics in response to spider pictures (Dilger et al 2003) and fearful faces (Wright et al 2003). In contrast to these findings, other recent fMRI studies did not report insula activation to spider videos in spider phobics (Paquette et al 2003) or to angry faces in social phobics (Stein et al 2002). Furthermore, a PET study by Furmark et al (2002) even found reduced insula activity in social phobics during public speaking. Such discrepancies between studies with phobic subjects require further  Figure 4.

An important variable, which should be investigated, is the influence of the amount of subjects’ distraction while threatening stimuli or situations are present. High processing demand by cognitive tasks or by active behavior (e.g., in the study by Furmark et al 2002) could attenuate or even suppress insula activation (e.g., Critchley et al 2002).  In contrast to the results for the insula, the increased amygdalar activation to angry faces in social phobics compared with control subjects was restricted to the implicit task and to the right amygdala. The amygdala has been shown to be involved in the detection of threat signals and in the rapid mediation of fear responses (for review see Büchel and Dolan 2000; LeDoux 1998; Öhman and Mineka 2001), although there is also evidence for a more general role of the amygdala in the processing of emotionally arousing stimuli (e.g., Kilpatrick and Cahill 2003; Winston et al 2003). In healthy subjects, especially fearful relative to neutral faces have been found to activate the amygdala (for review see Phan et al 2002). Angry faces seem to be less effective in evoking increased amygdalar responses (Blair et al 1999; Whalen et al 2001). Here, control subjects showed amygdalar activation to angry versus neutral photographic faces in the explicit condition, whereas phobics showed amygdalar activation in both tasks. We did not observe amygdalar activation to schematic faces, which led to strong effects of habituation (see also Breiter et al 1996; Phelps et al 2000; Rauch et al 2000; but see Wright et al 2002).  Elevated reactivity of the amygdala to phobia-relevant experimental conditions has been previously described in animal  Table 5. Signiﬁcant Activation to Angry Versus Neutral Schematic Faces  phobics (Dilger et al 2003, but see Paquette et al 2003) as well as in social phobics (Birbaumer et al 1998; Furmark et al 2002; Stein et al 2002; Tillfors et al 2001, 2002; Veit et al 2002). The present findings extend the results of Stein et al (2002), who reported amygdalar activation in social phobics to threatening versus happy faces in a gender decision task. There is evidence for stronger amygdalar responses to clearly fear-relevant stimuli during implicitly compared with explicitly emotional tasks (e.g., Critchley et al 2000; Keightley et al 2003; Lange et al 2002; but see Anderson et al 2003; Gur et al 2002). A similar effect was present in our study. Amygdalar activation was bilateral during the implicit task but restricted to the left hemisphere during the explicit task. Attenuation of amygdalar responses in phobics during the explicit task, which might be due to cognitive modulation of subcortical activity (e.g., Keightley et al 2003), might also explain the absence of group differences in amygdalar activation during the explicit task.  The other ROI within the medial temporal lobe, the parahippocampal gyrus, was also more strongly activated in phobics than in control subjects during the implicit task. This increased response is in accordance with previous studies with phobic patients. Stein et al (2002) found greater left parahippocampal activation to angry faces in social phobics than in control subjects during a gender decision task. Paquette et al (2003) reported activation in the left and in the right parahippocampal gyrus when spider phobics were exposed to film excerpts depicting spiders. The parahippocampal gyrus has been strongly associated with memory functions (Brewer et al 1998; Wagner et al  Region of Interest  Implicit Task  Insula STS  Explicit Task  Phobics  Control Subjects  Phobics ⬎ Control Subjects  Side  x  y  z  t  x  y  z  t  x  y  z  t  R L  40 ⫺56  ⫺21 ⫺51  5 8  4.08 5.01  ⫺56  ⫺42  11  4.08  10  51  DMPFC DMPFC Insula Fusiform gyrus 3.36 x, y, z, Talairach coordinates of maximally activated voxel (activation threshold: p ⬍ .005, uncorrected, cluster ⱖ 50 mm3); STS, superior temporal sulcus;  ⫺40 ⫺35  ⫺12 ⫺72  19 ⫺13  4.22 4.54  R L L L  5.91a  ⫺35  11  4.98  20  3.77  36  32  ⫺72  ⫺13  ⫺8  10  54  DMPFC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; L, left; R, right.  aSigniﬁcantly greater than in the implicit task.  www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych  928 BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2004;56:921–930  T. Straube et al  monkeys is specifically evoked by pictures depicting expressions relevant for the interaction with conspecifics (e.g., Brothers and Ring 1993; Hasselmo et al 1989). Several fMRI studies showed activation of the STS when subjects were requested to evaluate the social content of pictures (e.g., LaBar et al 2003; Narumoto et al 2001; Winston et al 2002, 2003). The pattern of results of the present study, especially for photographic faces, suggests that visual processing and evaluation of photographic angry faces is increased in phobics as compared with control subjects in situations in which attending to facial expression is task-irrelevant. It seems that social phobics’ attention is strongly captured by angry facial expressions, whereas for control subjects angry faces are less salient (see also Heinrichs and Hofmann 2001).  Phobics and control subjects showed a similar activation pattern in the DMPFC. Activation was only observed in the explicit task, regardless of picture type (photographic or schematic). This is in line with evidence that the DMPFC is especially activated during explicit emotional decisions (Gusnard et al 2001; Lane et al 1997); however, there was a lack of significant differences in the direct comparisons between phobics and control subjects. This result and the absence of significant activation under the implicit condition do not seem to support the hypothesis of a specific role of the DMPFC in the processing  Figure 5. Insula activation to schematic angry versus neutral faces in social phobics. Left: activation of right insula during the implicit task (y ⫽ ⫺17; z ⫽ 4). Right: activation of left insula during the explicit task (y ⫽ ⫺11; z ⫽ 18). Statistical parametric maps are overlaid on a T1 scan (radiologic convention: left ⫽ right). The plots show the contrasts of parameter estimates (angry vs. neutral; mean ⫾ SEM for maximally activated voxel in the ROI). Bold, blood oxygen level–dependent.  1998). Thus, the functional role of the parahippocampal activity in phobics might be found in the strength of encoding processes (see also Kilpatrick and Cahill 2003). The parahippocampal response might also reflect a stronger automatic activation of information related to threat signals in phobics relative to control subjects (see also Paquette et al 2003), especially under the implicit condition.  In the ROIs of extrastriate cortex (fusiform gyrus and STS), phobics showed similarly strong responses to photographic faces during both tasks, whereas control subjects exhibited significantly less activation during the implicit task. For schematic faces, phobics showed increased visual processing as well, although activation was task-specific (STS in the implicit and fusiform gyrus in the explicit task). Several studies with healthy subjects demonstrated that activation in the fusiform gyrus is modulated by the emotional importance of facial expressions and the attention focus during picture processing (e.g., Keightley et al 2003; Pessoa et al 2002; Vuilleumier et al 2001). The posterior STS is supposed to play a crucial role for the evaluation of the social relevance of stimuli (for reviews see Allison et al 2000; Haxby et al 2002). For example, activity of STS neurons in  www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych  Figure 6. Extrastriate activation to schematic angry versus neutral faces in social phobics.

Straube et al  BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2004;56:921–930 929  of social phobia–relevant stimuli. In contrast to our findings, Stein et al (2002) reported increased activation to threatening faces in the DMPFC in social phobics relative to control subjects when subjects attended to the gender of faces. The results of this study were based on the specific contrast used for analysis (threatening vs. happy faces) and on a blocked picture presentation and are therefore not directly comparable to our findings. Future functional imaging studies should directly compare eventrelated and blocked designs concerning their effects on medial prefrontal activation. It might be that activation in DMPFC is detected during sustained periods of threat-relevant stimulation rather than during short-lasting events.  In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of varying experimental conditions for the detailed investigation of brain activation to threat signals in social phobic subjects. The consistently increased activation of the insula across experimental conditions suggests a significant role of this brain region in the processing of threat-relevant stimuli. Furthermore, the results to control subjects, indicate that social phobics, intensively process angry facial expressions regardless of whether focussed processing is required or not. A limitation of this study is the small sample size, which might have restricted the detection of further significant differences. Furthermore, the relatively liberal, uncorrected significance level used for the ROI analysis might have resulted in false-positive results. The present fMRI study shows preliminary findings regarding task-dependent brain responses to threat signals in phobic subjects, and further work is strongly needed.  in contrast  The study was supported by the Deutsche-Forschungs-Gemeinschaft (DFG project number: Mi 265/5-1/2).

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is ﬁrst-line psychotherapy for SAD, however, many remain symptomatic after treatment indicating baseline individual differences in neurofunctional activity may factor into CBT outcome. An emotion regulation strategy practiced in CBT is cognitive restructuring, a proxy for reappraisal. Therefore, neural response during reappraisal may serve as a brain-based predictor of CBT success. Prior to 12 weeks of individual CBT, 34 patients with SAD completed a validated emotion regulation task during fMRI. Task instructions included ‘Reappraise,’ that is, use a cognitive approach to reduce affective state to a negative image, which was contrasted with looking at a negative image (‘Look’). Regression results for Reappraise (vs. Look) revealed greater reduction in symptom severity was predicted by less pre-CBT activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Regarding predictive validity, DLPFC signiﬁcantly classiﬁed responder status. Post-hoc analysis revealed DLPFC activity, but not demographic data, baseline clinical measures, or reappraisal-related affective state during fMRI, signiﬁcantly accounted for the variance in symptom reduction. Findings indicate patients with SAD are more likely to beneﬁt from CBT if there is less pre-treatment DLPFC recruitment, a region strongly implicated in emotion regulation. Patients with reduced baseline frontal activation when reappraising negative stimuli may be especially helped by explicit cognitive interventions. Further research is necessary to establish DLPFC as a stable brainbased marker of treatment outcome.  © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  1. Introduction  Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common psychiatric illness characterized by pervasive fears of potential scrutiny by others (Kessler et al., 2005). Inappropriate, excessive fears in SAD are due in part to emotion dysregulation as indicated by an overreliance on expressive suppression, a generally maladaptive avoidance regulation strategy to cope with emotion (Heimberg et al., 2014; Spokas et al., 2009). Suppression in SAD is mediated by social concerns, for example, the belief that inhibiting expressions reduces the likelihood of negative evaluation (Spokas et al., 2009). In addition to suppression, socially anxious individuals report low levels of self-efﬁcacy when implementing emotion regulation strategies including cognitive reappraisal (Werner et al.,  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago,  1747 W. Roosevelt Rd, IL 60608, Chicago, United States.  E-mail address: hklumpp@psych.uic.edu (H. Klumpp).  2011). Reappraisal is an antecedent form of regulation directed at cognitively changing a situation to alter its emotional signiﬁcance; it is considered an adaptive, explicit regulation approach known to engender social support and psychological well-being (Gross and John, 2003).  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a ﬁrst-line psychotherapy for SAD and other anxiety disorders (Hofmann and Smits, 2008) that aims to reduce symptoms by increasing adaptive emotion regulation (O'Toole et al., 2015), and indeed, reappraisal is utilized more frequently in SAD patients who participated in CBT (Moscovitch et al., 2012). Although CBT is the “gold standard” psychotherapy for SAD, response rate varies considerably ranging from 4% to 80% (Loerinc et al., 2015). Thus, many patients remain symptomatic after completing treatment. Increasingly, the utility of brain-based predictors is being realized as they are frequently superior in foretelling who is likely to achieve clinically-meaningful response to CBT relative to demographic and/or baseline clinical information alone (Ball et al., 2014; Doehrmann et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2015). Evidence brain-based markers may be  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.01.010 0278-5846/© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  H. Klumpp et al. / Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 75 (2017) 106–112  107  reappraisal  includes  more sensitive in predicting treatment outcome than non-imaging measures are in line with the conceptualization psychiatric illnesses are brain illnesses (Downar et al., 2016). In other words, it stands to reason that individual differences in brain pathophysiology will interact with mechanisms of treatment. In neuroimaging studies,  interpreting (e.g., “reframing”) an aversive stimulus to decrease the negative affect evoked by it (Webb et al., 2012), an approach that generally echoes cognitive strategies employed in CBT, for example, generating alternative appraisals to negate negative beliefs (Hofmann, 2004; Hope et al., 2006). Cognitive reappraisal has been widely studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and converging data in healthy individuals show reappraisal engages regions central in higher-order processes (e.g., attention, inhibition, working memory) such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), as well as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), though ventral areas have been less consistently observed (Buhle et al., 2014; Messina et al., 2015). Together, these regions form a cognitive control network which underlies the ability to deliberately modulate reactions to emotional stimuli.  Consistent with behavioral observations of emotion dysregulation in SAD, Goldin et al. (2009a) observed less DLPFC and less dorsal ACC (dACC) recruitment in SAD when reappraising negative faces compared to healthy controls. Moreover, SAD participants failed to exhibit more reappraise-related activity in any regions relative to controls. In a separate study, there was evidence of delayed engagement of DLPFC, dACC, VLPFC, MPFC, and dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) when reappraising negative beliefs compared to controls (Goldin et al., 2009b). Findings suggest patients with SAD were able to eventually recruit regions that support regulation but may have required additional time to override the initial emotional reactivity to negative stimuli (Goldin et al., 2009b). Patterns of prefrontal hypo-activity or delayed reappraise-related recruitment in SAD relative to healthy controls has also been shown in other tasks involving negative socio-emotional stimuli (Ziv et al., 2013). Altogether, these data are consonant with reports of reduced activation in dorsal and ventral lateral regions during reappraisal in other anxiety disorders (e.g., panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder) and major depressive disorder suggesting impairment in cognitive reappraisal capacity is a transdiagnostic factor in internalizing psychopathologies (Zilverstand et al., 2016).  The clinical implication is that pre-CBT variation in frontal activity during reappraise may interact with CBT outcome as this cognitive approach is a proxy to the interventions practiced in CBT (e.g., cognitive restructuring) (Arch and Craske, 2009). While this has yet to be examined in SAD, less baseline DLPFC activation in reappraise, relative to looking at aversive images, has been shown to predict CBT success in panic disorder (Reinecke et al., 2014), which has shared neurobiological features with SAD (Demenescu et al., 2013). These data suggest CBT may be most beneﬁcial to those who have greater regulation deﬁciency when using a cognitive approach to downregulate emotional reactivity. Results also indicate the DLPFC or other areas involved in emotion regulation may be a mechanistic target of CBT. In support, SAD patients who completed CBT relative to a waitlist control group exhibited increased DLPFC and DMPFC activity when reappraising negative social situations suggesting a generalization of the techniques learned in CBT (Goldin et al., 2013). There is also evidence of greater pre-to-post CBT reappraisal-related activation (compared to waitlist control) in the superior/middle frontal gyrus and middle occipital gyrus as well as less activity in posterior superior temporal gyrus, which collectively predicted 24% of the variance in symptom severity reduction. Yet, neural changes in other conditions (i.e., react praise, react criticism) did not signiﬁcantly account for the decrease in social anxiety symptoms nor did selfreported pre-to-post-CBT decreases in negative emotion. Findings signify neural correlates of emotion regulation were a target of CBT. These data indicate reappraise-related disturbances in SAD interact with CBT  and that alterations in brain response during reappraise contribute to a reduction in symptoms. However, it is not clear if frontal regions key to reappraisal predict CBT outcome in SAD.  The goal of the present study was to test whether pre-CBT brain activity using cognitive reappraisal to reduce negative affective state evoked by aversive images predicted clinical improvement in patients with SAD. To this end we employed an emotion regulation task (ERT) based on paradigms previously used to examine cognitive reappraisal mechanisms in other labs (Ochsner et al., 2002) and in our lab in healthy participants (Phan et al., 2005) and patient cohorts (MacNamara et al., 2016; Rabinak et al., 2014). We hypothesized larger decreases in symptom severity would be predicted by less pre-CBT activation in cognitive control areas when reappraising negative images compared to naturally reacting to negative images (i.e., “Look Negative”). We also hypothesized brain activity, but not demographic data, clinical measures, or on-line reappraisal ability, would signiﬁcantly account for the pre-topost change in symptom severity after completing CBT. Lastly, we explored whether baseline symptom severity correlated with less neurofunctional activity in reappraise relative to “Look Negative.”  2. Methods  2.1. Participants  All participants provided written informed consent as approved by the local Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and all procedures complied with the Helsinki Declaration. Diagnosis was based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (“SCID-IV”; First et al., 1995) and the clinician-administered Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale total score (“LSAS”; Liebowitz, 1987) determined symptom severity. Depression level was evaluated with the clinicianadministered Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (“HAM-D”; Hamilton, 1960). Regarding self-reported symptoms, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck et al., 1996) and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983) assessed depression and general trait anxiety level, respectively. A master's-level clinician trained in the SCID-IV and clinician-administered measures performed assessments. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (“ERQ”; Gross and John, 2003) was used to evaluate subjective habitual use of reappraisal and expressive suppression. Participants were compensated for their time.  Participants were between 18 and 55 years of age, free of major medical or neurologic illness as conﬁrmed by a Board Certiﬁed physician. SAD was required to be the primary diagnosis and participants with comorbidity were not excluded. All participants were free of psychotropic medications and none were receiving concurrent psychotherapy. None of the participants tested positive for drugs.  Exclusion criteria included contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (e.g., pregnancy, claustrophobia, non-removable ferrous objects), current substance abuse or dependence (within 6 months of study), or history of major psychiatric illness (e.g., bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder).  2.2. Treatment  Within a week of the fMRI scan, patients began once-weekly sessions of manualized individual CBT for 12 weeks, which comprised psycho-education, cognitive restructuring, in vivo exposures to fears, and relapse prevention (Hope et al., 2006). A CBT-trained licensed clinical psychologist or post-doctoral clinical psychologist conducted treatment. The clinicians were supervised by a licensed clinical psychologist with expertise in CBT and clinical trials. Response to CBT was deﬁned as a 50% (or more) reduction in symptom severity as indexed with the LSAS total score (Jakubovski and Bloch, 2014; Roy-Byrne et al., 2010; van Vliet et al., 1994). Symptom severity was assessed by a nontreating clinician.  108  2.3. fMRI task  H. Klumpp et al. / Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 75 (2017) 106–112  During the ERT participants were instructed to: 1) use a cognitivelinguistic strategy to reduce negative affect evoked by an aversive image (“Reappraise”); 2) attend to, be aware of, and “feel what you naturally feel” when looking at an aversive image (“Look Negative”); or 3) view neutral images (“Look Neutral”). Prior to the scan, participants were instructed on the strategy of reappraisal (Ochsner et al., 2002; Phan et al., 2005) and all conditions were practiced with images not used in the experiment to conﬁrm understanding of task instructions. The task comprised 64 unpleasant and 32 neutral International Affective Picture System images (Lang et al., 2008). There were eight 20s blocks of each condition (four images presented for 5 s each), which were interspersed with 20-s baseline blocks (comprising a white ﬁxation cross presented on a black background). At the beginning of each block, the instruction to ‘Reappraise,’ ‘Look Negative,’ or ‘Look Neutral’, appeared in white text on a black screen for 5 s. Immediately following each task block, participants were asked to rate “How negative do you feel?” on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely) via button response. The order of blocks was pseudo-randomized over 4 separate runs of 5 min each.  2.4. fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing  Scanning was conducted on a 3 Tesla GE Signa System (General Electric; Milwaukee, WI) and performed with blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)-sensitive whole-brain fMRI using GE software (LX 8.3, Neuro-optimized gradients). Images were acquired using a gradientecho echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2 s, TE = 25 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, ﬁeld of view = 22 × 22 cm2, acquisition matrix 64 × 64; 44 axial, 3-mm-thick slices with no gap. For anatomical localization, a high-resolution, T1-weighted volumetric anatomical scan was acquired.  Data from all participants met criteria for quality with minimal motion correction (movements were b3 mm andb 3° rotation in any one direction) and the ﬁrst 4 volumes from each run were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Conventional preprocessing steps were used in the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software package (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London; www.ﬁl.ion.ucl. ac.uk/spm). Brieﬂy, images were temporally corrected to account for differences in slice time collection, spatially realigned to the ﬁrst image of the ﬁrst run, normalized to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, resampled to 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 voxels, and smoothed with an 8 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel.  2.5. fMRI analysis  A general linear model was applied to the time series, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and with a 128 s high-pass ﬁlter. Nuisance regressors comprising 6 motion parameters were included to correct for motion artifacts. Blocks of Reappraise, Look Negative, and Look Neutral trials, were modeled separately, the effects of which were estimated for each voxel for each participant and taken to the second level for random effects analysis.  To assess predictors of CBT response, contrasts of interest from SAD pre-treatment scans were entered into a whole-brain analysis of covariance, regressing LSAS change (ΔPreTx − PostTx) while initial severity (LSASPreTx) was controlled for as a regressor of no interest. To correct for multiple comparisons, simulation was performed using the 3dClustSim utility (10,000 iterations; updated and ‘bug-free’ on December 2015; [https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/ 3dClustSim.html]; Cox, 1996) where residuals for each participant related to the contrast of interest was used to estimate smoothness and applied to second-level statistical results. Signiﬁcance at α b 0.05 with a height threshold of p b 0.005 across the entire brain (i.e., a wholebrain gray matter mask [volume = 1,459,304 mm3]) revealed a  minimum cluster size of 141 voxels (volume = 1128 mm3) for the regression analysis.  To illustrate the magnitude and direction of activation for effects, parameter estimates of peak activation for signiﬁcant a priori ﬁndings (β weights, arbitrary units [a.u.]) were extracted from spherical (10-mm diameter) regions of interest (ROI) from each participant and submitted to Pearson correlations and scatter plots in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (Chicago, IL version 22). Importantly, statistical analyses were not performed on these Reappraise vs. Look Negative data as signiﬁcance at the whole-brain level was already established. Additional analyses were performed in SPSS to explore the extent to which activation in an a priori ROI was driven by Reappraise or Look Negative. Accordingly, spherical ROIs generated for the Reappraise vs. Look Negative ﬁndings were subsequently applied to a non-emotional baseline: Reappraise vs. Look Neutral and Look Negative vs. Look Neutral. Beta values for these contrasts were then submitted to two-tailed Pearson correlations.  To explore the validity of signiﬁcant clusters in predicting CBT response, ROC curves in SPSS evaluated whether activity in a priori whole-brain ﬁndings classiﬁed responder status. These same regions were submitted to cross-validation and split-sample validation analysis in SPSS to examine reproducibility. Lastly, post-hoc multiple regression analyses were performed in SPSS to test whether activation, in the context of demographic and clinical measures, signiﬁcantly explained variance in pre-to-post CBT change in symptom severity. All analyses were two-tailed with alpha level set at 0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Participant characteristics  Thirty-four patients with SAD (65% female) had a mean age of 25.0 ± 4.7 years and an average symptom severity (LSAS total score) of 77.7 ± 14.0 meeting the standard cutoff of 60 for the generalized SAD subtype (Mennin et al., 2002). Depression levels ranged from mild to moderate as the clinician-administered HAM-D indicated patients were mildly symptomatic (average 8.3 ± 5.3) (Zimmerman et al., 2013) and self-report was suggestive of moderate depression symptoms (average 20.8 ± 9.5) (Beck et al., 1996). Regarding concurrent disorders, they were generalized anxiety disorder (n = 11), panic disorder (n = 4), speciﬁc phobia (n = 3), adjustment disorder (n = 1), posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 1), and an eating disorder (n = 1). Eleven SAD patients had another anxiety disorder, 8 had major depressive disorder, and 5 had comorbid dysthymia. Altogether, 11 patients had more than one current comorbid disorder. Concerning race/ethnicity, 64.7% self-identiﬁed as Caucasian, 17.6% as Asian, and 2.9% as African American. About 29% self-identiﬁed as Hispanic and 14.7% as unknown or other than Caucasian, Asian, African American, or Hispanic.  3.2. Treatment effects  After completing 12 weeks of CBT, symptom severity (i.e., LSAS) signiﬁcantly decreased (pre = 77.7 ± 14.0; post = 47.3 ± 23.3) (p b 0.001) as did depression level as assessed with the HAM-D (pre = 8.3 ± 5.3; post = 3.2 ± 3.3) (p b 0.001) and the BDI (pre = 20.8 ± 9.5; post = 4.9 ± 7.2) (p b 0.001). Self-reported emotion regulation tendencies determined with the ERQ revealed an increase in the use of reappraisal (pre = 23.1 ± 5.9; post = 30.0 ± 5.3) (p b 0.001) and a decrease in the use of expressive suppression (pre = 17.9 ± 5.1; post = 15.2 ± 6.0) (p b 0.007). Approximately 32% (11/34) were ‘responders’ as they demonstrated at least a 50% reduction in symptom severity based on the LSAS total score and 68% (23/34) were ‘non-responders’. These groups did not differ in baseline LSAS [t(32) = 0.57, p = 0.58], HAM-D [t(32) = 0.83, p = 0.41], BDI [t(32) = 1.77, p = 0.09], trait anxiety level [t(32) = 0.45, p = 0.66], self-reported  H. Klumpp et al. / Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 75 (2017) 106–112  109  reappraisal [t(32) = 0.09, p = 0.93] or suppression [t(32) = 0.91, p = 0.37], age, [t(32) = 0.13, p = 0.90], educational level [t(32) = 0.88, p = 0.38], gender [χ2(1) = 0.46, p = 0.50], or race/ethnicity [χ2(3) = 1.45, p = 0.69].  3.3. Subjective ratings during fMRI  Planned comparisons with two-tailed t-tests revealed more negative affect after attending to negative images (3.06 ± 0.65) relative to reappraise (2.48 ± 0.73) [t(33) = 5.71, p b 0.001] and looking at neutral pictures (1.30 ± 0.47) [t(33) = 17.16, p b 0.001]. Negative affect was also reported as greater after reappraising negative images relative to looking at neutral images [t(33) = 11.46, p b 0.001].  3.4. fMRI results  Whole-brain regression ﬁndings for Reappraise vs. Look Negative, corrected for multiple comparisons at alpha level p b 0.05, revealed greater reduction in symptom severity after CBT was predicted by less baseline activity in the left DLPFC [(− 44, 18, 48) z = 3.34, k = 162, volume = 1296 mm3] (Fig. 1A). As expected, a negative relationship between DLPFC activity and symptom change (r = − 0.54) was illustrated in SPSS (Fig. 1B). Post-hoc ROC analysis in SPSS showed DLPFC activity accurately discriminated between responders and non-responders [(AUC) = 0.79; p b 0.007] (Fig. 2).  When applying the DLPFC ROI generated for Reappraise vs. Look Negative to a non-emotional baseline, there was no correlation between Reappraise vs. Look Neutral and change in symptom severity (r = −0.28, p = 0.11) or Look Negative vs. Look Neutral and change in symptom severity (r = 0.10, p = 0.56). However, within group analyses demonstrated Reappraise vs. Look Neutral was negatively linked with symptom severity in responders (r = −0.69, p b 0.02) but not  Fig. 2.

No associations were observed between change in symptom severity and Look Negative vs. Look Neutral in responders (r = −0.47, p = 0.15) or non-responders (r = 0.14, p = 0.53). When exploring links between baseline symptom severity and baseline Reappraise vs. Look Negative, only negative relationships emerged; for example, higher LSAS total scores were associated with less DMPFC [(−8, 48, 16) z = 2.84, k = 39, volume = 312 mm3] activity. However, this whole-brain ﬁnding and other clusters did not survive adjustment for multiple comparisons (all clusters b 141 contiguous voxels).  Fig. 1.

Post-hoc analysis  A two-step hierarchical multiple regression analysis (forced entry) showed that in Step 1, change in symptom severity was not predicted by baseline clinical measures (LSAS, HAM-D, trait anxiety, Reappraisal, Suppression), demographic data (i.e., age, education level), or affective state related to Reappraisal during the fMRI task [R2 = 0.19, F(7,26) = 0.86, p = 0.55]. However, when DLPFC activation for Reappraise vs. Look Negative was entered in Step 2, it accounted for signiﬁcant variance in symptom severity reduction (standardized β = −0.66; p b 0.003) (zero-order correlation = −0.540, partial correlation = −0.55) resulting in signiﬁcance in the full model [R2 = 0.44, F(8,25) = 2.42, p b 0.04]. To evaluate predictive reproducibility, DLPFC activation was submitted to a 10-fold cross-validation analysis in SPSS, which revealed overall performance was 79.4% (risk estimate 0.35; SEM 0.08). Split-sample validation using random assignment of 2 separate cohorts (training = 60% of cases, test = 40% of cases) showed 68.8% of responders were classiﬁed correctly and 66.7% of test cases were classiﬁed correctly (risk estimate = 0.31 and 0.33, respectively).  4. Discussion  The primary objective of the current study was to test whether response in CBT was predicted by reappraisal-related neural activity in patients with SAD. Explicit emotion regulation with a cognitive approach such as reappraisal is a proxy to the cognitive interventions practiced in CBT (e.g., cognitive restructuring). Therefore, neural activity in structures that support regulation before treatment may interact with CBT. We hypothesized less baseline frontal activity during reappraisal in the context of negative images would predict reduction in symptom severity. In support of our hypothesis, treatment outcome was signiﬁcantly foretold by pre-CBT activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during emotion regulation. However, despite evidence of a brain-based predictor, there was no signiﬁcant relationship between initial symptom severity and regulation-related neural activity.  Speciﬁcally, patients with SAD exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease in social anxiety symptoms (i.e., LSAS change (ΔPreTx − PostTx)) after 12 weeks of individual CBT, which was predicted by less pre-treatment activation in DLPFC when interpreting (e.g., reframing) images of general negative content (“Reappraise”) relative to being aware of, and experiencing naturally, the emotions brought about by aversive images (“Look Negative”). To evaluate whether baseline DLPFC activation was primarily driven by regulation or reactivity to negative images, post-hoc analyses were conducted contrasting Reappraise and Look Negative separately with a non-emotional baseline. Results showed deﬁcient DLPFC recruitment was primarily driven by Reappraise in treatment responders (i.e., ≥50% reduction in social anxiety symptoms) though ﬁndings need to be interpreted with caution given the exploratory nature of correlations and small number of patients who attained responder status. Furthermore, ﬁndings did not extend to pre-treatment analysis. That is, baseline symptom severity alone did not correlate with neurofunctional activity during emotion regulation. The lack of signiﬁcant results may have been due to a restriction of range in symptomatology and without a healthy control comparison group, we cannot determine the extent to which pre-CBT activity was aberrant.  With regard to predictive validity, DLPFC signiﬁcantly classiﬁed responder status and cross-validation and split-sample validation approaches suggest DLPFC's predictive ability was stable. The DLPFC ﬁnding is important as its recruitment has consistently been observed in studies of cognitive reappraisal (Buhle et al., 2014; Messina et al., 2015). It is a domain-general cognitive control area well-positioned to integrate sensory information and behavioral control given its interconnections with other prefrontal areas (Miller and Cohen, 2001), motor regions (e.g., supplementary motor area) (Petrides and Pandya, 1999), and input from parietal areas (Petrides and Pandya, 1999). Most  relevant to the process of reappraisal, the DLPFC is engaged in volitional attention and working memory, functions integral to the monitoring and manipulation of information (Ochsner and Gross, 2005). Our data indicate individual differences in DLPFC activity during regulation interacts with treatment though further study is needed to determine whether its predictive ability is unique to CBT or generalizes to other interventions (e.g., pharmacotherapy).  Behaviorally, patients reported a reduction in negative affective state in the reappraisal condition suggesting a capacity to downregulate reactivity to negative information when instructed. It is also notable that after completing CBT, patients reported an increase in habitual reappraisal tendencies and a decrease in suppression indicating a shift to more adaptive means of regulation after treatment. Yet, individual differences in baseline ‘on-line’ regulation ability and pre-CBT selfreported regulation propensities did not signiﬁcantly correspond with CBT outcome.  Additionally, post-hoc multiple regression results revealed DLPFC activation signiﬁcantly accounted for decreases in symptoms (ΔPreTx − PostTx) whereas demographic data, clinical measures, and baseline affective state related to the reappraisal task were non-signiﬁcant. These data add to accruing evidence regarding the advantage of neural biomarkers to predict which patient is likely to improve in CBT (Ball et al., 2014; Doehrmann et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2015). That said, we recognize baseline regulation-related DLPFC activity tracked change in symptom severity as indexed with LSAS. Further work in neuroscience-based taxonomy is needed to identify and advance neural predictors that do not solely rely on symptom measures, which are prone to bias and demand characteristics.  Our observation that CBT may be especially beneﬁcial to patients with SAD who have less neurofunctional regulation capacity expands on previous studies of neural predictors in SAD. For example, less baseline dACC reactivity to social criticism was associated with CBT success a year after completing treatment in SAD patients (Månsson et al., 2015) and when demands on attentional resources are high (e.g., ‘ignore’ threat distractors under high perceptual load), greater reduction in symptom severity was predicted by more baseline disruption in frontal regions (less dACC-DLPFC connectivity) (Klumpp et al., 2016). In contrast, studies of emotion processing have shown pronounced symptom improvement is associated with more pre-CBT activation in frontal regions (e.g., medial orbitofrontal, dorsomedial frontal gyrus) and secondary visual areas (e.g., occipitotemporal cortex) when attending to threat faces (Doehrmann et al., 2013; Klumpp et al., 2013). Also, when attention is simply directed away from emotional stimuli, via attentional deployment to non-emotional stimuli, greater baseline activation in frontal areas predicted greater change in symptom severity (e.g., dACC; Klumpp et al., 2014). Considered together, the direction of activation in predicting CBT response in SAD appears to be sensitive to the circuitry probed by a paradigm. Further study is needed to delineate what pre-treatment neural properties CBT improves on or what baseline strengths CBT capitalizes on.  In summary, greater reduction in symptom severity following CBT was predicted by less baseline activity in the DLPFC, a region strongly implicated in cognitive reappraisal (Buhle et al., 2014; Messina et al., 2015). Potentially, patients with reduced frontal recruitment when downregulating emotions elicited by negative cues are more likely to improve with CBT techniques that heavily rely on higher-order functions such as cognitive restructuring, a multi-step process that begins with the monitoring of maladaptive thoughts and its relationship to emotions. Approaches used by therapists (e.g., Socratic method, logical empiricism, behavioral experimentation) aid in the identiﬁcation of negative thoughts and faulty beliefs that are subsequently challenged with the adoption of a rational, objective perspective (Arch and Craske, 2009). Therefore, the process of restructuring would appear to involve executive functions important for volitional regulation such as cognitive ﬂexibility, inhibition (e.g., ability to ignore internal or external distractors), attention (capacity to sustain focus), and working memory.  H. Klumpp et al. / Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 75 (2017) 106–112  111  While our data indicate CBT capitalizes on less baseline frontal recruitment when modulating emotional reactivity, other studies report a different pattern in tasks that entail executive functions. For example, in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) decreases in symptom severity is predicted by more efﬁcient inhibitory control (e.g., greater pre-CBT activation in frontal network) (Falconer et al., 2013) and in SAD more and less pre-to-post CBT activation when reappraising criticism signiﬁcantly accounts for clinical improvement (Goldin et al., 2014). Possible reasons for mixed results include differences in the neurobiology between SAD and PTSD (e.g., medial PFC hypo-activity in PTSD; Etkin and Wager, 2007) and the method used to identify neural predictors in SAD (Goldin et al., 2014). Namely, regions linked to pre-to-post treatment changes in activation may not necessarily serve as brain-based predictors of CBT response (Fu et al., 2008; Klumpp et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014). Here, we used a whole-brain approach focused on preCBT activation; still, we cannot rule out inconsistent ﬁndings may be due to other methodological differences between studies (e.g., type of paradigm, neuroimaging acquisition parameters, patient sample).  Results need to be considered in the context of important limitations. First and foremost, there was no treatment control or waitlist control group, therefore, neural and clinical ﬁndings cannot be causally attributed to CBT and could be due to factors not related to treatment such as differential regression to the mean in patients. Second, our sample size was relatively modest and is not fully representative of typical patients as none were taking a psychotropic medication. Third, ﬁndings are based at the group, as opposed to single-subject, level of analysis thus reducing the clinical utility of using baseline fMRI data to predict which patient has a high probability of responding to CBT. Fourth, treatment responders were required to have at least a 50% reduction in social anxiety symptoms, which is consistent with other studies (Jakubovski and Bloch, 2014; Roy-Byrne et al., 2010; van Vliet et al., 1994). Nevertheless, it has been argued that this cutoff may be too conservative (Bandelow et al., 2006) and may explain why relatively few ‘responded’ to CBT. Other factors that potentially contributed to the low response rate include depression symptoms and relatively high comorbidity, which have been associated with poorer outcome (Chambless et al., 1997; Hoyer et al., 2016; Ledley et al., 2005; Mululo et al., 2012). Fifth, emotion regulation results involved general negative images and may not generalize to other types of negative content (e.g., ideographic stimuli). Lastly, CBT encompasses an amalgam of techniques; therefore, we cannot conclude neural predictors are limited to one element of CBT (e.g., cognitive restructuring).  5. Conclusions  Our study indicates patients with SAD are more likely to beneﬁt after completing CBT if they have less baseline recruitment of a regulatory structure when using a cognitive approach to reduce negative affective state. Speciﬁcally, greater reduction in symptom severity was predicted by less pre-CBT activity in the DLPFC when using reappraisal to downregulate emotions elicited by a negative stimulus. Reappraisal is a proxy for the cognitive strategies practiced in CBT aimed at altering the dysfunctional thinking associated with SAD. Accordingly, ﬁndings suggest patients with greater pre-CBT impairment in explicit regulation may be especially helped by explicit cognitive interventions practiced in CBT. Further research is necessary to determine whether DLPFC is a stable predictor of CBT outcome or other standard interventions for SAD.

In order to infer that effects observed with the speciﬁc items (a particular set of pictures or stories) are generalizable to the entire population (all faces, or all stories about beliefs), it is necessary to perform an “item analysis.” Item analyses may also reveal relationships between secondary (non-hypothesized) features of the items and functional activity. Here, we perform an item analysis on a set of stories commonly used for localizing brain regions putatively involved in Theory of Mind (ToM): right and left temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ/LTPJ), precuneus (PC), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). We address the following questions: Do brain regions that comprise the ToM network respond reliably across items (i.e. different stories about beliefs)? Do these brain regions demonstrate reliable preferences for items within the category? Can we predict any region's response to individual items, by using other features of the stimuli? We ﬁnd that the ToM network responds reliably to stories about beliefs, generalizing across items as well as subjects. In addition, several regions in the ToM network have reliable preferences for individual items. Linguistic features of the stimuli did not predict these item preferences.  © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  Consider the following scenario: a researcher wishes to investigate brain regions recruited for Theory of Mind (ToM), i.e. the ability to attribute and reason about the mental states of other individuals. To that end, she creates two sets of stories, one set describing beliefs held by different protagonists and a set of control stories not including beliefs. Using a standard analysis strategy, each brain region's response to belief versus control stories is evaluated for signiﬁcance, by comparing the average effect size (belief Ncontrol) to the variability of the effect across subjects. The researcher concludes that the resulting brain network is recruited more for processing/ representing the category of stories about mental states than the category of control stories. This conclusion, however, goes beyond what was explicitly tested. From a standard analysis, she can only conclude that a contrast between these exact stimuli will on average reveal the same brain regions in a different group of subjects. She cannot conclude that these brain regions will reliably be recruited for other (or all) stories about beliefs.  This example illustrates the “ﬁxed-effects fallacy” (Clark, 1973) or the unfounded inference that conclusions about items sampled from a population generalize to the entire item population. Up until the late  ⁎ Corresponding author.  E-mail address: feder@fas.harvard.edu (D. Dodell-Feder).  1053-8119/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.040  1990s, neuroimagers fell victim to this same problem with subjectwise analyses by treating subjects as “ﬁxed” variables. In treating subjects as a “ﬁxed” variable, the variability of an effect across subjects is not taken into account, which is especially problematic if there is substantial variability in the effect size across participants. Consider an instance in which only one out of ﬁve subjects shows a very large effect for some condition, and the other subjects show no effect. Averaging the effect across subjects, the entire group will appear to exhibit a medium-sized effect. Therefore, in modern neuroimaging analyses, random-effects analysis is used, which compares an effect to its variability across subjects. This strategy allows researchers to test whether their ﬁndings will generalize to the population from which the subjects are sampled (Friston et al., 1999; Holmes and Friston, 1998). In the example above, treating subjects as a random variable would reveal that the apparent medium-sized average effect is not reliable across subjects.  This same issue exists at the item level. Perhaps only one or two of the stories about beliefs recruit a brain region very strongly (due to some theoretically irrelevant feature), while the remaining stories have no effect. Averaging across items, the group of belief stories will appear to recruit this brain region to a moderate degree. In order to make (theoretically more important) generalizations about the category to which an item belongs, one needs to evaluate the effect size relative to the variation of the effect across items, in an item-wise random-effects analysis. Only upon doing so can one validly conclude that the given brain network is reliably recruited for the item category.  706  D. Dodell-Feder et al. / NeuroImage 55 (2011) 705–712  Item analysis has yet to become common practice for neuroimagers despite the fact that it has the potential to reveal theoretically relevant distinctions and is known to be feasible. For example, Bedny et al. (2007) tested the hypothesis that distinct brain regions in the frontal and temporal cortex process nouns and verbs (grammaticalclass effect). Using subject-wise analysis, they found a differential brain response to verbs versus nouns in the left posterior temporal lobe and left inferior frontal lobe. Conversely, item analysis revealed that only the effect in the temporal lobe was reliable across items, whereas the effect in the frontal lobe was not. This ﬁnding suggests that the grammatical-class effect in the frontal region was speciﬁc to the nouns and verbs used in the experiment; the effect would not necessarily generalize to other items from the same categories. Therefore, it would be erroneous to conclude that a region within the frontal lobe was specialized for processing verbs versus nouns, despite the signiﬁcant subject-wise effect. In that case, the item analysis reconciled conﬂicting ﬁndings regarding the role of the prefrontal cortex in processing speciﬁc aspects of language (Bedny and Thompson-Schill, 2006; Davis et al., 2004; Shapiro et al., 2006; Tyler et al., 2001, 2004).  The ﬁrst goal of the current study was therefore to apply item-wise random effects analyses to an experimental paradigm frequently used to identify brain regions involved in ToM. Following in the tradition of developmental investigations of ToM (Wimmer and Perner, 1983), neuroimaging studies have often used “false belief” stories to test belief reasoning. In these stories, a protagonist performs an action based on a belief that is false (e.g., Maxi believes his chocolate is in the green drawer, but his mother moved it to the blue drawer). Participants reading these stories are thus required to represent the outdated belief of the protagonist in order to understand their actions (e.g., looking in the green drawer even though the chocolate is actually in the blue drawer). These stories are contrasted with “false photograph” stories, which also require the representation of false or outdated content (e.g., an old photograph that no longer accurately depicts the landscape of a burgeoning city). False belief and false photograph stories are therefore matched in their general difﬁculty, logical complexity, and inhibitory demands, but differ in the need to think about someone's thoughts. Accordingly, a set of stories about false beliefs and false photographs (Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003) is commonly employed across a range of studies to identify brain regions in the so-called “ToM network”: right and left temporoparietal junction (RTPJ/LTPJ), superior temporal sulcus (STS), precuneus (PC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) (Kliemann et al., 2008; Mitchell, 2008; Saxe and Powell, 2006; Saxe et al., 2006; Saxe and Wexler, 2005; Scholz et al., 2009; Young et al., 2007, 2010a). It is therefore theoretically important to establish that these regions' recruitment generalizes beyond the speciﬁc commonly used stimuli. Here, we used an item analysis to formally test whether the brain response to these speciﬁc stories about false beliefs can be generalized to the category of such stories.  Item analyses also have a second advantage. An item analysis produces an estimate of the response in each brain region, to each speciﬁc stimulus. If a region has a reliable preference for speciﬁc items within a category, this preference may provide a clue about the region's function. Every item in an fMRI experiment can be characterized on multiple different dimensions or features (e.g., for stories about beliefs, the number of people or mental states mentioned, the degree of syntactic complexity, the speciﬁc context of the story, etc.). It may be possible to determine which item dimensions or features best predict each region's response. These dimensions or features may be confounds, which explain away previous categorical effects, or they may conﬁrm and expand prior results, by allowing a higher-resolution picture of the region's processing, within stimulus categories. One speciﬁc concern is that activity in the ToM network is best accounted for by linguistic features of the stories that are concomitant with the presence of belief  information. The extent to which these factors account for activity in ToM brain regions can be evaluated within a single paradigm by analyzing data at the item level.  In the current paper, we used item analyses to investigate the ToM network. We ask the following questions: (1) Does item-wise analysis replicate subject-wise analysis? That is, does the response in ToM brain regions generalize across items within each stimulus category (false beliefs and false photographs)? (2) Do ToM brain regions demonstrate a reliable preference for items within each category? And, (3) what features of the items account for activity/stable preference for items in these regions? We characterized the stimuli used by Saxe and colleagues (e.g., Saxe and Powell, 2006; Saxe and Wexler, 2005; Young et al., 2007, 2010b) on several dimensions (words per story, number of people per story, Flesch reading ease level, visualizability and several other linguistic aspects), and asked whether any of these features could predict differences between items in the response of ToM brain regions.  Methods  Participants  Sixty-two right-handed naïve adults (M age = 22 ± 4 years, range=18–35, 35 females) participated in the experiment for payment. All participants were native English speakers, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and gave written informed consent in accordance with the requirements of the internal review board at MIT. For a portion of the analyses, the participants were split into two independent groups. The two groups did not differ in age or gender (Group 1: n=32, M age=22±3, 17 females; Group 2: n=30, M age=23±5, 18 females; Age: t(60)=1.18 p=.25; Gender: χ2(1)= .298 p=.59).  Stimuli  Stimuli consisted of 20 stories in each of two conditions: (1) stories describing false beliefs (BELIEF) and (2) stories describing outdated (i.e. false) photographs and maps (PHOTO; Table 1; Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003, Experiment 2. See Supplementary Table 1 for a complete list of BELIEF and PHOTO items along with the corresponding beta values from the RTPJ, LTPJ, PC, RpSTS, RTP, DMPFC and MMPFC). Both sets of stories required participants to represent false content; the critical difference was in the type of false content represented (i.e., a belief versus a photograph/map). Stories were followed by a true/false question that referred either to the situation in reality or to the false representation. There were an equal number of questions that referred to the reality and representation in each condition, the order of which was counterbalanced within and across runs. Participants responded to the question with a button response. Reaction time (RT) data were collected during the scan.  In the scanner, stories were presented visually for 10 s, followed by the true/false question for 4 s and ﬁnally 12 s of rest (a black screen). Stories were presented in a pseudo-random order with the order of conditions counterbalanced across runs and participants. Eight stories were presented in each of 4 runs (4 stories per condition per run) for a total run time of 14 min and 24 s. The text of each story was presented in 30-point white font on a black background via Matlab 7.6 running on an Apple MacBook Pro.  fMRI data acquisition and analysis  Participants were scanned at 3 T (at the MIT scanning facility in Cambridge, MA) with a 12-channel head coil using thirty 4-mm-thick near axial slices covering the whole brain. Standard echoplanar imaging procedures were used (TR=2 s, TE=30 ms, ﬂip angle=90°). The ﬁrst  D.

These sequences used PACE online motion correction, which adjusts the slice acquisitions during scanning to correct for head movement up to 8 mm.  FMRI data were analyzed using SPM2 (http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/ spm) and custom software. Each participant's data were motion corrected and normalized onto a common brain space (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI template). Data were smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁlter (full width half maximum=5 mm) and were high-pass ﬁltered during analysis. The experiment used a block design and was modeled using a boxcar regressor convolved with a standard hemodynamic response. We performed both subject- and item-wise, whole-brain and ROI analyses following the general procedure of Bedny et al. (2007).  For the subject-wise analysis, individual subject ﬁrst-level models were created using a general linear model with conditions (BELIEF, PHOTO) as covariates of interest. Second-level random effects analysis was performed on the contrast images generated from the ﬁrst-level models for BELIEF NPHOTO. Here, the variance between the effect sizes for BELIEF NPHOTO across subjects was used to calculate a t statistic at each voxel, treating subjects as a random variable. The whole-brain BELIEF NPHOTO contrast was FDR corrected for multiple comparisons at p b.01.  In the item-wise analysis, individual subject ﬁrst-level models were creased using a general linear model with each of the 40 items entered as a covariate of interest. This yielded 40 beta maps per subject, which were averaged across subjects to obtain a single beta map per item. Second-level random effects analysis used these values to compute condition differences (BELIEF NPHOTO) via a two-sample t-test at every voxel, treating the items as a random variable. The whole-brain BELIEF NPHOTO contrast was FDR corrected for multiple comparisons at p b.01.  For ROI analysis, participants were divided into two independent groups (Group 1 n=32, Group 2 n=30). Regions identiﬁed from the subject-wise random effects analysis of Group 1 were used to extract data from Group 2 participants. Each of the 7 ROIs – RTPJ, LTPJ, PC, right posterior superior temporal sulcus (RpSTS), right temporal pole (RTP), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and middle medial prefrontal cortex (MMPFC) – was deﬁned as a sphere of contiguous voxels 9 mm from the peak that were signiﬁcantly more active (p b.0001, uncorrected, k N10) for the BELIEF NPHOTO contrast in Group 1. To investigate whether item analysis replicated the ﬁndings of previous subject-wise analysis, t-tests were conducted on the average beta values for all BELIEF versus all PHOTO stories in Group 2, in each ROI. All peak voxels are reported in MNI coordinates.  Testing the reliability of the ROI item response: item-wise correlation analysis  To investigate whether a larger response to particular items was consistent across groups of participants, we performed an item-wise  correlation analysis. In this procedure, ROIs (RTPJ, LTPJ, PC, RpSTS, RTP, DMPFC, MMPFC) were deﬁned from the 62 subject subject-wise random effects analysis of BELIEF NPHOTO (as a sphere of contiguous voxels 9 mm from the peak at p b.0001, uncorrected, k N10), and used to extract beta values for each story for each individual. Then, the 62 participants were randomly split into two groups 100 times, and for each iteration, the average beta per item was calculated in each group. These beta values were correlated across groups within each ROI, separately by condition, creating 100 Pearson r values, which allow us to estimate the mean and variance of the reliability of item preferences within condition, across participants. Note that for this procedure, we are measuring the item response correlation between the two groups within each condition. Given that the ROIs are deﬁned based on between condition differences (i.e., BELIEF NPHOTO), the measured correlation is independent of the ROI selection procedure.  Item coding and regression analyses  Beta values from Group 2's data (extracted from ROIs deﬁned in Group 1) only were used for all subsequent analyses. To address the question of which features of the item accounted for activity in the ROIs, stories were coded for several linguistic, social and general conceptual as well as perceptual features. Thirteen linguistic features were coded: number of words per story, Flesch reading ease, anaphor reference, causal content, causal cohesion, lexical concreteness, negation, noun-phrase modiﬁcation, higher-level constituency, number of words before the main verb, intentional content, attitude predication and modality; four social features: number of people per story and the extent to which the items made readers think about the mental states, deception, and social status; and two general conceptual and perceptual features: the extent to which the items made readers think about physical causality and imagine/visualize the events of the story while reading. Altogether, 19 item features (detailed below) were coded.  First, a group of features of each story was estimated by collecting independent participants' ratings of the stories on ﬁve dimensions evaluating the extent to which our items made readers think about (i) mental states, (ii) deception, (iii) social status, (iv) physical causality and (v) the extent to which the story made participants image/visualize events. These data were collected via an online study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (M-Turk). Participants were instructed to answer one of the following questions using a Likert scale from 1 (very little) to 7 (very much): (i) “To what extent did this story make you think about someone's experiences, thoughts, beliefs, desires, and/or emotions?”, (ii) “To what extent did this story make you think about someone being deceived or fooled by someone or something?”, (iii) “To what extent did this story make you think about someone's appearance, social status, or role in society?”, (iv) “To what extent did this story make you think about physical objects, and physical causal interactions?”, and (v) “To what extent did you  708  D. Dodell-Feder et al. / NeuroImage 55 (2011) 705–712  picture or imagine the events of the story happening as you read?” These ﬁve questions were individually paired with each of the 40 stories, for 160 separate single-question surveys. Participants were allowed to do as many surveys as they wanted, for a total of 20 participants per survey question (except question (v), which was answered by 50 participants).  The number of words in each story, and the number of people  mentioned in each story, were counted by the experimenters.  To characterize the other linguistic features of the items, we used the Coh-Metrix, a metric designed to measure computational cohesion and text difﬁculty, based on measures of syntactic, semantics, and representational difﬁculty (Graesser et al., 2004; McNamara et al., 2002, 2006). The Coh-Metrix includes 54 linguistic features. We chose twelve speciﬁc features to analyze in this experiment, using two criteria. First, the feature must be variable across the stimulus items. For example, we excluded any feature that was absent from all of the items. Second, we prioritized features that are hypothesized to modulate activity in the ToM network (e.g., amount of intentional information, number of verbs expressing belief or desire information that use sentential complement clause syntax, general text comprehensibility/difﬁculty). Below we describe each of the ﬁnal eleven measures in detail.  One of the features, Flesch reading ease, measures comprehension difﬁculty by calculating average sentence length and the number of syllables per word. Higher Flesch reading ease scores indicates easier text and increased readability.  Four of the features measure aspects of semantic cohesion: anaphor reference, causal content, causal cohesion, and lexical concreteness. Increased semantic cohesion has been shown to correlate with increased ease of processing, mental modeling, and overall comprehension. Anaphor reference measures the number of times a single idea, item, or action is referred to throughout the text, indexed by the number of anaphors in each story (such as pronouns it, he, she, and ellipsis markers, did, was) that refer to a constituent that appeared previously in the story. Causal content is a measure of the extent to which a story conveys causal information, which is correlated with coherence, comprehensibility and ease of mental modeling (Graesser et al., 1997). This index is estimated by counting the number of main verbs in the text that are categorized as causal in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998; Miller et al., 1990). Causal information alone does not guarantee comprehensibility — a reader must also be able to coherently connect causal events and actors. Thus, we also measured causal cohesion, the ratio of causal particles to causal verbs, for each story. Causal particles include because, due to, if, thus, unless. A low causal cohesion score correlates with lack of general textual cohesion and increased difﬁculty of comprehension. Finally, lexical concreteness is a measure of the overall concreteness of the words in the story. Concreteness was computed by ﬁnding the mean concreteness of the content words (primarily nouns and verbs) in the stimuli, based on human rating data from the MRC Psycholinguistics Database (Coltheart, 1981).  Four of the features measure aspects of syntactic complexity: negation, noun phrase modiﬁcation, higher-level constituency, and words before the main verb. Increased syntactic complexity is correlated with increased working memory load, slower processing, and difﬁculty in comprehension. Negation is one index of syntactic complexity, measured by counting the negative expressions in the text, such as no, not, un-, without. Noun phrase modiﬁcation, measures the mean number of modiﬁers, such as adjectives, adverbs, and determiners, per noun phrase, indexing the difference between most of the very ﬂuffy and drooling puppies (seven modiﬁers) and the puppies (one modiﬁer). A more general feature, higher-level constituency, counts the number of complex units per sentence (such as phrases and clauses) controlling for word count. Sentences with a high number of high-level constituents are often structurally dense, with unusual syntax or embedding, and are generally harder to process. Fourth, sentences with a high number of words before the main verb  have been shown to be taxing on working memory, making this an additional index of the working memory load for a story.  Finally, three linguistic features were speciﬁcally chosen to be relevant for ToM: intentional content, attitude predication, and modality. First, Intentional content, like causal content, is a measure of coherence within the text. However, rather than looking at causal relationships, this index measures the incidence of intentional actions and events based on the number of intentional main verbs, categorized based on WordNet ratings. The higher the incidence of intentional actions in a text, the more likely the text is to convey goaldriven content. If ToM regions are sensitive to goal-driven action or desire, they might show sensitivity to variation along this dimension. Second, Attitude Predication measures the number of verbs (predicates) that express thoughts and desires, such as believe, want, and think, per 100 words. Acquisition of these verbs has been implicated in development of ToM, both because they allow the expression of mental states and because of their syntax (e.g. opacity: a sentence containing an attitude predicate can be false without affecting the truth of the full sentence, as in John thinks that there are unicorns is his yard; de Villiers and Pyers, 2002). Third, Modality measures the number of operators that deal with possibility and necessity, such as the words possibly, should, might, and must, per 100 words. This class of words has a very similar set of properties as attitude predicates, including opacity and sentential embedding. However, this class crucially does not deal with mental states or desires, and thus serve as a useful comparison for effects of attitude predication.  (For a correlation matrix of pair-wise correlations among all of  these features, see Supplementary Table 3).  We performed stepwise forward/backward regression analyses with ROI item response. In stepwise regression, at each step, one predictor is added to the regression, which most improves the model's ﬁt to the data (the forward step). The overall model ﬁt is penalized for each additional predictor, to avoid over-ﬁtting. Predictors are then excluded if their contribution to predicting the outcome becomes non-signiﬁcant after other predictors are included in the model (the backward step). The process is iterated until adding an additional predictor would not signiﬁcantly improve the model ﬁt. Each ROI's response to the items was the outcome (dependent) variable and the item features and condition were the predictor (independent) variables. Given the large number of predictors (20) entered into the regression, we used a fairly stringent entry and removal criteria (entry=.01, removal=.05; see Supplementary Table 2 for regression results performed with entry p=.05 and removal p= .10).  Results  Subject- and item-wise whole brain random effects analysis  We ﬁrst asked whether brain regions that reliably respond to belief information across subjects also respond reliably across items. To that end, we performed whole brain subject- and item-wise analysis on the same data set. Fig. 1 depicts the brain regions signiﬁcantly more active (FDR corrected, p b.01, k N10) for the BELIEF versus PHOTO stories across subjects, and across items, in the whole brain (see Table 2 for list of brain regions). All of the brain regions thought to comprise the ToM network (RTPJ, LTPJ, PC, DMPFC, MMPFC, RSTS, left superior temporal sulcus [LSTS], RTP) were reliably active in both subject- and item-wise analysis indicating that the ToM network also has a reliable response across items.  Brain regions active for subject-wise analysis and not item-wise analysis were the left temporal pole (LTP), right posterior middle frontal gyrus, calcarine sulcus, middle cingulate gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus and orbito-frontal cortex, indicating that these regions are not reliably activated across false-belief items. That is, these brain regions (not considered part of the classic ToM network) may appear in the subject-wise analyses due to features of a small number of  D.

If so, this would suggest that the region is responding to speciﬁc features of the item. To address this question, we performed an item-wise correlation analysis, correlating ROI response to the items across groups created by randomly splitting the 62 subjects into two groups 100 times. Mean Pearson r values across the 100 iterations along with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) of the mean r value are reported in Table 3 (data from Group 1 and Group 2 are depicted in Fig. 2). The range of mean correlation values was .25 (MMPFC) to .82 (PC). Reliability estimates of these correlations (95% CI of the mean) ranged from ±.10 (PC) to ±.35 (MMPFC).  The within-condition, cross-group correlations demonstrate that most of the ROIs in the ToM network have reliable preferences for items within each condition. An interesting question is whether all the regions in the ToM network have the same item preferences, or whether different brain regions prefer different items. To address this question, we correlated item beta values from Group 2 across ROIs (deﬁned from Group 1), separately for BELIEF and PHOTO items (Table 4). The regions mostly showed uncorrelated preferences among the BELIEF items; the only two signiﬁcant correlations were between the RTPJ and each of the PC and RTP (PC and RTP response were not correlated with each other). For the PHOTO items, by contrast, many of the regions shared similar preferences: item-wise preferences for PHOTO items were correlated among the RTPJ, LTPJ, PC, RpSTS, and RTP, and between the DMPFC and MMPFC, for example (see Table 4 for the complete list).  In sum, most of the ToM regions had reliable preferences for speciﬁc items within the BELIEF and PHOTO conditions, and these preferences were not identical across regions, especially for stories about false beliefs. These results raise the important question of which features that vary between the individual items predict the itemspeciﬁc responses in each of these regions.  Using item features to predict ROI item response  To test the predictive power of many features simultaneously, we performed stepwise forward/backward regressions. In the RTPJ and LTPJ, condition (RTPJ: standardized β=.695, t(39)=5.97, p b.001; LTPJ: β=.592, t(39)=4.53, p b.001) emerged as the only signiﬁcant predictor of activity. The resulting model accounted for 47.0% (RTPJ) and 33.3% (LTPJ) of the variance in the response across items (adjusted for the number of predictors). In the PC, RpSTS and RTP,  710  D.

In the PC, only number of people (β = .729, t(39) = 6.57, p b.001) was included in the model, accounting for 51.9% of the variance. In the RpSTS, only the extent to which M-Turk participants reported that they considered the thoughts, beliefs and desires of someone in the story (β = .680, t(39) = 5.71, p b.001) reliably predicted BOLD signal, accounting for 44.8% of the variance. In the RTP, only number of words per story (β = .525, t(39) = 3.80, p b.001) reliably predicted BOLD signal, accounting for 25.6% of the variance. In the DMPFC and MMPFC, none of the factors reliably predicted BOLD signal. The other linguistic features were not included in the ﬁnal model of the response in any of the ToM regions.  Discussion  Inferences about the cognitive function of brain regions based on fMRI data can be signiﬁcantly strengthened by item analyses, to show that effects of speciﬁc items generalize to the entire item category. However, item analyses remain rare, and have not previously been  Table 3 Item-wise correlation analysis: mean correlation (r-value) and 95% conﬁdence interval of the mean.

Dodell-Feder et al. / NeuroImage 55 (2011) 705–712  711  RTP, e.g., Aichhorn et al., 2009; Mitchell, 2008; Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003; Saxe and Powell, 2006; Saxe and Wexler, 2005) showed signiﬁcantly higher responses to BELIEF than PHOTO stories, in itemwise whole brain random effects and in ROI analyses. These results provide formal evidence that ToM network activity in response to these stimuli is not due to idiosyncratic features of a small number of these stimuli, but instead generalizes to the category of such stories about false beliefs. By contrast, several brain regions were revealed only in the subject-, but not item-wise analysis: left temporal pole (LTP), right posterior middle frontal gyrus, calcarine sulcus, middle cingulate gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus and orbito-frontal cortex. The absence of these regions in the item analysis suggests that they would not reliably be activated by other ToM stimuli, and indeed, these regions are not reliably observed across other experiments testing ToM.  Inferences from these data must be qualiﬁed, however. The power of item analyses is limited by the sample of stimuli, and the method by which they were generated. Item analysis supports generalization to a whole population speciﬁcally when experimental items were randomly sampled from that population. This limit is analogous to limits on generalizing the results of standard subject-wise analyses: in general, those results should be generalized only to the population from which the subjects were sampled, usually college-aged, highly educated, middle-class/wealthy individuals (as in the current experiment; see Henrich et al., 2010). Given the nature of the items of interest here (verbal narratives), it is hard to quantify the population from which they constitute a random sample. Also, the current stories are not a representative sample of all stories about people's thoughts, because these stories did not contain many descriptions of other mental states like true beliefs, desires, or emotions. Stronger conclusions could be reached in future studies, using item analyses with a larger and more variable set of stimuli, and a better characterized method for generating a ‘random sample’ of such stimuli (e.g. by selecting random passages from published short stories).  The true scope of the response in regions of the ToM network is suggested by the wide range of prior studies that have reported activity in these regions, using verbal (e.g., Aichhorn et al., 2009; Fletcher et al., 1995; Gallagher et al., 2000; Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003) and non-verbal stimuli (e.g., Castelli et al., 2000; Gallagher et al., 2000; German et al., 2004; Walter et al., 2010), stimuli depicting true beliefs (Saxe et al., 2009; Saxe and Powell, 2006; Young et al., 2010a) and false beliefs (Fletcher et al., 1995; Gallagher et al., 2000; Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003; Vogeley et al., 2001), stimuli in English and nonEnglish languages (Kobayashi et al., 2007), stimuli describing beliefs and preferences (Jenkins and Mitchell, 2010), and stimuli describing affective as opposed to purely epistemic states (Vollm et al., 2006; Walter et al., 2010). Taken together with the current ﬁndings, the response of the ToM network does indeed appear to generalize not just to stories about false beliefs, but to the entire category of mental states (or stimuli that lead to mentalizing).  The second purpose of the item analysis was to produce an estimate of the response in each brain region, to each speciﬁc stimulus. If a region has a reliable preference for speciﬁc items within a category, this preference may provide a clue about the region's function. We found that the RTPJ, LTPJ, PC, RpSTS, RTP and DMPFC had reliable preferences for speciﬁc items within conditions, across participants. Furthermore, item preferences were not highly correlated across brain regions, especially for BELIEF stories. Thus, these item preferences could reveal the distinct functions of individual regions within the ToM network.  We therefore attempted to predict the item-speciﬁc responses of each region, using twenty different features of the items. The features we coded included belief-related aspects of the story (the extent to which the story made participants consider somebody's thoughts or desires, or to which someone was being deceived), social features (number of people per story and the extent to which someone's social  status, role or appearance was considered), causal content (including the extent to which the story made participants consider physical causal interactions) and text difﬁcultly/comprehensibility (e.g. number of words, and various measures of syntactic complexity). The linguistic features were of particular interest, since previous authors have suggested that ToM depends distinctively on syntactic representations of embedded sentence complements (e.g. “Hank thinks that his saxophone is in the closet”; de Villiers and Pyers, 2002), and that linguistic features might account for the activity in ToM brain regions (Ferstl and von Cramon, 2002; Ferstl et al., 2008).  We found that simple models, including only one or two factors, best accounted for the cross-item variability in each region's response. The best model of the RTPJ and LTPJ, in particular, included only the single factor of condition (BELIEF versus PHOTO stories), which accounted for almost half of the overall variance in the RTPJ and a third of the variance in the LTPJ. In the PC, the best predictor was the number of people in the story: there was greater activity in the PC for stories that mentioned more people. In the RpSTS the best predictor was the independent ratings of another group of participants, of how much each item made them consider the “thoughts, beliefs, desires or emotions” of the protagonist.  These differences between regions are intriguing, but should be interpreted with caution: in the current relatively small set of stimuli, the number of people in the story and these M-Turk ratings, were both highly correlated with condition. When two predictors are highly correlated, a step-wise regression assigns all of the associated variance in the output variable to one of the two predictor variables: whichever one initially accounts for the most variance. Thus, small differences in the predictive power of two correlated input variables can lead to different-looking models. Future research using regressions over item analyses should use larger sets of stimuli, in which the predictor variables can be better disentangled.  Perhaps the most intriguing result of the regression analyses was the factors that were not able to predict the ToM regions' preferences for items. Linguistic features of the stimuli, and other features we coded, like visualizibility, textual difﬁculty, and causal content, apparently do not explain away the neural response in any of the ToM regions. It remains an open challenge to account for the withincondition preferences in these regions; we welcome suggestions (the Supplementary Materials includes Supplementary Table 1, showing the response of each brain region to each item).  One practical implication of these results is that it should allow for easier identiﬁcation of ToM brain regions in new subjects by using the BELIEF stories that produce the greatest activation in the ToM network, and the PHOTO stories which produce the least amount of activation in the ToM network. We conﬁrmed this prediction and report, in the Supplementary Materials (see “ToM Superlocalizer”) the results of two naïve subjects tested with an extremely more efﬁcient version of the false belief task: just 5 stories from each condition. This new version produced reliable activation in the ToM network in just 5 min of scanning. Thus, item analyses afford the additional advantage of providing data that can inform the design of more efﬁcient scanner paradigms.  Conclusion  In summary, item analysis provides two important features beyond those of conventional fMRI analyses: They allow the generalization of effects from items employed in a speciﬁc experiment to entire categories of items and can provide insight into the more subtle relationships between functional activity and cognitive processes that would normally be obscured by analysis at the category level. In consideration of these ideas, we employed item analysis on a false belief task for ToM brain regions. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that (1) activity in the ToM network generalizes to the category of falsebelief stories, and (2) some regions within the network have a reliable  712  D. Dodell-Feder et al. / NeuroImage 55 (2011) 705–712  preference for speciﬁc items within conditions. However, the itemspeciﬁc responses on these regions were not predicted by plausible confounding factors like the visual vividness or linguistic complexity of the items. Thus, item analyses may reveal a previously unknown division of labor in the ToM network for processing speciﬁc stories about beliefs. These hypotheses, suggested by exploratory item analyses, must be conﬁrmed by direct experimental manipulation, and eventually, to get beyond the correlational analyses of fMRI, using tools like transcranial magnetic stimulation, that allow researchers to test a brain region's causal role (Young et al., 2010b).

However, little is known about whether and to what degree the cognitive processes that underlie impression formation depend on the domain of the available information about the target person. To investigate the neural bases of the inﬂuence of verbal as compared to nonverbal information on interpersonal judgments, we identiﬁed brain regions where the BOLD signal parametrically increased with increasing strength of evaluation based on either short text vignettes or mimic and gestural behavior. While for verbal stimuli the increasing strength of subjective evaluation was correlated with increased neural activation of precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PC/PCC), a similar effect was observed for nonverbal stimuli in the amygdala. These ﬁndings support the assumption that qualitatively different cognitive operations underlie person evaluation depending upon the stimulus domain: while the processing of nonverbal person information may be more strongly associated with affective processing as indexed by recruitment of the amygdala, verbal person information engaged the PC/PCC that has been related to social inferential processing.  © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  In our everyday life we are ready to make fast and spontaneous judgments about other persons (Uleman et al., 2008), which are determined by our very subjective evaluation of the available information about the target person (Schiller et al., 2009). Furthermore, ﬁrst impressions are mostly not restricted to inferences about enduring dispositions, e.g., that someone is intelligent because he passed a math test, but also encompass an evaluative component due to the assignment of a rather positive or negative value to someone's individual characteristics. Importantly, the outcome of such an evaluation crucially determines our expectations and behavior toward social others (Delgado et al., 2005; Uleman et al., 2008).  However, little is known about whether the cognitive processes mediating the evaluation of another person differ depending upon the domain of available information. While the traditional person judgment research has relied on verbal stimuli such as action description or trait adjectives, short excerpts of nonverbal behavior have been demonstrated to be equally effective in evoking differentiated  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University  Hospital Cologne, Germany.

But although ratings of other persons may lead to similar outputs across different domains of information, this does not allow for inferences regarding the degree of similarity of underlying cognitive processes. However, comparing the neural correlates of impression formation that relies on verbal and nonverbal person information, respectively, could be used as an index for such conclusions. Thus, the present study explores putative differences in the neural signature of the evaluative component of impression formation dependent upon whether the underlying relevant social information was presented verbally or nonverbally. Given the far-reaching consequences of impression formation within social interactions, elucidating possible domain-speciﬁc differences in the related neural processing would extend the understanding of interpersonal behavior and might have signiﬁcant implications for social decisions.  Theoretical considerations suggest divergent processing streams across domains by stating that language is digitally deﬁned by an explicit semantic code with a complex logical syntax, while the interpretation of analog nonverbal signals appears to be more uncertain as multiple cues may occur simultaneously and extend over time, and are known to have greater impact on the affective, relational level of communication (Kraemer, 2008; Watzlawick et al., 1967). Supporting these assumptions, a recent neuroimaging study indeed  180  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 60 (2012) 179–188  has demonstrated domain-speciﬁc neural systems involved when drawing inferences about social targets' affective states: while verbal information processing was associated with the mental state attribution system including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), precuneus (PC), temporopolar and temporoparietal regions, the nonverbal information processing related to the right inferior frontoparietal network corresponding to the putative human mirror neuron system, bilateral amygdala, right superior temporal sulcus (STS) and fusiform gyrus (FFG) (Zaki et al., 2010). Direct comparisons between verbal and nonverbal stimuli though cannot identify speciﬁc differences in social cognition because of additionally present basic differences in sensory and cognitive processing across domains.  In the speciﬁc context of interpersonal judgments, little is known about the neural processing of dynamic nonverbal behavior. However, studies using still neutral faces have provided consistent evidence for the amygdala being crucially involved in their evaluation with respect to judgments of trustworthiness and valence (Todorov, 2008; Todorov and Engell, 2008; Winston et al., 2002). Although being generally associated with salience detection, and with assigning an emotional value to external cues, the response of the amygdala appears to be particularly sensitive for faces that convey signiﬁcant social cues (Hariri et al., 2002; Sergerie et al., 2008). In contrast, the processing of verbal person information in the context of interpersonal judgments has been consistently associated with the dmPFC (Harris et al., 2005; Mitchell et al., 2002, 2005; Ochsner et al., 2005; Sugiura et al., 2004; Zysset et al., 2002). While this is in concordance with its central role in mental state attribution and person perception (Amodio and Frith, 2006), it has recently been demonstrated that the dmPFC is not specifically involved in evaluative processes of impression formation (Schiller et al., 2009). Instead, evaluation of others has been shown to differentially engage the amygdala and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which were activated stronger by stimuli that guided subsequent judgments (Schiller et al., 2009). Additionally, these regions also exhibited increases in the BOLD signal with increasing strength of the evaluative judgment (Schiller et al., 2009). The study by Schiller and colleagues, however, failed to investigate putative stimulus domainspeciﬁc differences as they used simultaneously both verbal and nonverbal stimuli. Our study was conducted to directly address this aspect: Speciﬁcally, we were interested in exploring differences in neural processing of verbal and nonverbal social information, which evokes increasing strengths of evaluative person judgment.  Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we employed an experimental paradigm containing verbal (V) and nonverbal (NV) stimuli of different valences (positive, negative, and neutral). Participants were instructed to rate target persons along a global positive– negative scale based on either a) a short video clip showing an animated virtual character displaying dynamic expressive nonverbal behavior; or b) short verbal action description. Additionally, the arousal of all stimuli was assessed after scanning in order to control for this dimension of person perception. We aimed to identify brain regions whose activity correlated with the ‘strength’ of subsequent evaluations of social others based either on verbal or nonverbal information (operationalized as a difference from 0 on the rating scale, i.e., including both positive and negative judgments). Notably, we based this analysis on individual responses in order to take into account that the same piece of information can have different meanings or values for different persons. We expected that brain regions, which are involved in the evaluation of others, would increase their activation with increasingly pronounced impressions. By focusing on the parametric modulation of the neural activity by the ‘strength of evaluation’ (SoE), this paradigm allows to compare different domains, in spite of basic sensory and cognitive stimulus-speciﬁc processing differences. The SoE-effect was computed separately for each domain, so that across all events the basic stimulus characteristics were identical and differences related only to the degree to which they, in fact, inﬂuenced the subsequent evaluation of the target person.  Methods  Subjects  18 right-handed participants with no reported history of neurological or psychiatric illness were included in the study (9 males, mean age=24.7, age range 21–29 years). All participants gave informed consent and were naïve with respect to the experimental task and the purpose of the study. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the University Hospital Cologne.  Stimuli  Positive and negative verbal and nonverbal stimuli were created as reported in detail in Kuzmanovic et al. (2011). Verbal stimuli (V) consisted of sentences describing a social action suitable to induce an impression of a female target person (e.g., “She told the secrets of a colleague to the others.” vs. “She did not tell the secrets of a colleague to the others.”; see Fig. 1B). Nonverbal stimuli (NV) consisted of dynamic video clips of 3 s duration with an animated female virtual character displaying impression-evoking nonverbal signals. While using the same virtual character for all nonverbal stimuli, the following expressive features were systematically varied: Gaze direction (direct vs. averted gaze), facial expression (smile vs. angry face), body movements (forward vs. backward lean), and head movements (lateral vs. backward ﬂexion) (see Fig. 1A). The purpose of the strict control of the target person's physical appearance was to ensure that both verbal and nonverbal stimuli conveyed individuated social information related to idiosyncratic behavior, which is not reducible to more superﬁcial cues like face morphology or hair color. In addition, neutral verbal (non-social action descriptions: e.g., “She opened the drawer of her desktop.”) and nonverbal stimuli (non-expressive facial and body movements) were created in order to enable the comparison between impression-valent and impression-neutral stimuli. In each domain (V, NV), the three valence categories, i.e., negative (−), neutral (0) and positive (+), were matched for complexity. Verbal stimuli did not differ with regard to syntactic complexity as all sentences had a simple structure without any subordinate clauses and the same mean number of words (ANOVA of mean number of words per sentence for −, 0, +, F(2,33)=.04, p =.96). Furthermore, semantic complexity was also comparable across the valence conditions as there were no differences in the word frequency according to the German vocabulary project of the University of Leipzig (http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/; ANOVA of mean word frequency per sentence for −, 0, +, F(2,33) =.27, p =.76). Finally, neutral, positive and negative nonverbal stimuli had the same quantity of movement as measured by the mean of frame-to-frame pixel change per stimulus (ANOVA, F(2,33)=.40, p =.67).  The stimuli were pretested in an independent sample (n=14) with regard to ratings of valence (−3 = very negative to 3 = very positive) and arousal (−3 = not arousing to 3 = very arousing) resulting in mean ratings shown in Table 1. Paired t-tests revealed that positive verbal and nonverbal and negative verbal and nonverbal stimuli did not signiﬁcantly differ regarding valence or arousal ratings (p>.05 for all comparisons). However, although neutral verbal and nonverbal stimuli were comparable concerning the valence ratings (p>.05), they differed with regard to arousal ratings (t(13)=−2.85, p=.01) with neutral verbal stimuli being rated as less arousing than neutral nonverbal stimuli.  Procedure  Stimulus presentation and response recording were performed by the software package Presentation (version 13.1; Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc). Stimuli were projected onto a screen (Optostim, 32inch, resolution 1280×800) at the end of the magnet bore that  B.

Responses were assessed using a MR-compatible response device (Current Design).  Participants were instructed to judge female job applicants as positive or negative on a 7-point rating scale (−3 = very negative; −2 = negative; −1 = rather negative; 0 = neutral; 1 = rather positive; 2 = positive; 3 = very positive) based on either verbal or nonverbal information. A 7-point scale was used in order to enable participants to give neutral ratings as well. Verbal information was said to provide descriptions of the applicant's behavior toward colleagues at the prior workplace. Nonverbal information was said to be a “thin slice” of the applicant's behavior toward colleagues at the prior workplace. Participants were further instructed to treat the social referent across trials as different target persons. In other words, they were instructed to form a new impression on every trial independently of previously observed person information. It was explained that the nonverbal cues were overlayed on the same virtual character in order to control for effects of physical appearance on impression formation. An experimental trial consisted of a 3000 ms stimulus presentation (either V or NV) followed by a rating scale lasting for 3000 ms. Participants received a visual feedback about their button presses and could correct given responses if necessary until the end of the rating scale slide. Furthermore, each trial entailed two randomly jittered intervals with a ﬁxation cross: one between each stimulus presentation and the following rating scale in order to enable a separate analysis of the person evaluation and the response (average duration 3000 ms, jittering between 1875 ms and 4125 ms) and the other between single trials to increase conditionspeciﬁc BOLD signal discriminability (Serences, 2004) (average duration 9000 ms, jittering between 7875 ms and 10,125 ms). Taken together, an average trial lasted for 15,000 ms (see Fig. 1C). In total, the task consisted of 72 trials (36 stimuli for each of the two domains)  Table 1 Descriptive statistics of the stimuli: Means and standard deviations of valence and arousal ratings from the pretest. − −1.88 (.34) −2.08 (.63) 1.45 (.98) .96 (.86)  .08 (.16) −.09 (.54) −1.66 (1.01) −.61 (.92)  2.03 (.27) 1.76 (.32) .04 (1.23) .32 (.60)  Valence  Arousal  0  +  V NV V NV  that were presented in a randomized order within two sessions of 9 min duration each. In one session button presses were performed with the right and in the other session with the left hand, this sequence being randomized across participants. After scanning, participants underwent an additional task, in which they rated all stimuli on a 7point rating scale measuring arousal.  fMRI acquisition  Functional and structural MRI images were acquired on a Siemens Magnetom Trio 3T whole-body scanner with a Tx/Rx birdcage coil. For the fMRI scans we used a T2*-weighted gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following imaging parameters: TR=2200 ms, TE=30 ms, FoV=210, 33 oblique (maximal 30°) axial slices, and slice thickness=3.0 mm. Two sessions of 301 images were acquired, preceded by 3 additional images allowing for T1 magnetic saturation effects that were discarded prior to further image processing. For the structural images we used high-resolution T1weighted modiﬁed driven equilibrium Fourier transform sequence with the following parameters: TR=1930 ms, TE=5.8 ms, FoV=256, 128 sagittal slices, and slice thickness=1.25 mm.  fMRI preprocessing and analysis  Images were preprocessed and analyzed using MATLAB 7.1 (The MathWorks Inc) and SPM8 (The Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging) as follows. After the EPI images were corrected for head movements using realignment and unwarping, the mean EPI image of each participant was computed and coregistered to the corresponding T1 image. The T1 image was then used to obtain normalization parameters for each participant to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space using the uniﬁed segmentation function in SPM8. The ensuing deformation was subsequently applied to the individual EPI volumes, the T1 image and the segmented T1 images with a writing resolution of 8 mm3. The normalized EPI images were spatially smoothed using an 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel to meet the statistical requirements of further analysis and to compensate for macroanatomical variations across participants.  The data were analyzed using a General Linear Model as implemented in SPM8. The following speciﬁcations apply to all conducted analyses. Conditions were modeled using a boxcar reference vector  182  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 60 (2012) 179–188  convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and its time derivative. The analyses were explicitly masked with a normalized within-brain mask of each subject derived by the segmentation of individual T1-images. Stimulus events were deﬁned by the onsets and durations of corresponding stimulus presentations. Response events were modeled as a separate regressor, with onsets and durations according to the time the rating scale was present. If present, events with missing responses were modeled separately. Low-frequency signal drifts were ﬁltered using a cutoff of 128 s. Following the ﬁrst-level analyses, single subject contrasts were fed into the group analysis using a ﬂexible factorial ANOVA (factors: condition and subject), employing a random-effects model. On the group level, differences between conditions and signiﬁcant deviations from zero were assessed by linear contrasts on the second-level parameter estimates thresholded at p b.05 at the voxel level, FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons (pFWE-corr b.05) and with a minimal cluster size of 30 voxels. Exceptionally, when reporting results from the analysis including both evaluation strength and arousal as parametric modulators a more liberal threshold of p b.001 at the voxel level, uncorrected for multiple comparisons (puncorr b.001) was applied as this analysis speciﬁcally served to conﬁrm the signiﬁcant effect of evaluation strength. Results were superimposed on the mean normalized T1-group image.  Three different statistical analyses were conducted. The ﬁrst analysis focused on the SoE-effect by including both categorical and parametric neural responses to the stimuli into the model: (i) the categorical, general processing of verbal and nonverbal person information, respectively, disregarding its impact on subsequent evaluation (V and NV); and (ii) the parametric modulation of general processing by SoE (SoE-V and SoE-NV, deﬁned as a difference from 0 on a 7-point rating scale: 0, 1, 2 or 3). For illustration purposes only, i.e., in order to provide plots for the better characterization of activation patterns across different SoE levels for signiﬁcant brain regions, we also employed a categorical analysis, in which V and NV events with different absolute rating values were modeled as separate regressors. Here, eight events of interest were included in the analysis: V0, V1, V2, V3 and NV0, NV1, NV2, NV3 (see plots in Fig. 2A).  The second analysis aimed to demonstrate that differences in arousal ratings cannot explain the results of the parametric modulation. Here, the ﬁrst analysis was repeated but with two linear parametric modulation factors: (i) ﬁrst the arousal rating for each stimulus; and (ii) second the absolute valence rating for each stimulus. At the group level we again computed the SoE-V and SoE-NV contrasts, masked with the results from the main analysis. Because the second parametric modulation can only account for unique variance, which is not already accounted for by the ﬁrst parametric modulation, this allows for ruling out the inﬂuence of the arousal of the stimuli on the impression strength effect.  The third analysis ﬁnally aimed to demonstrate that the SoE-effect was similar for positive and negative person information and included six events of interest: V−, V0, V+ and NV−, NV0, NV+. At the group level, valent, i.e. positively and negatively judged events (Val) were compared against neutrally rated events, separately for the verbal (Val-V) and nonverbal (Val-NV) domains (applied contrasts: 1 −2 1).  Results  The ﬁrst analysis revealed distinct modulations of the general neural response by SoE for verbal and nonverbal stimuli, respectively. When judgments were based on nonverbal information, there was a linear signal increase in the bilateral amygdala with increasing SoE (see Fig. 2A and Table 2, SoE-NV). In contrast, when relying on verbal social information, increasing SoE correlated positively with the signal change in the left PC at the border to PCC (PC/PCC), the bilateral cuneus and cerebellum (see Fig. 2A and Table 2, SoE-V). These effects could mainly be replicated also in a direct comparison of SoE-V and SoE-NV, thereby resembling the plots in Fig. 2A. The contrast SoE-NV>SoE-V revealed a  greater increase in the right hippocampus (x=32, y=−10, z=−16, T=5.84, pFWE-corr=.002, cluster size=48 voxels) and the right amygdala (x=24, y=0, z=−20, T=5.39, pFWE-corr=.009, cluster size= 48 voxels, same cluster as the hippocampus). Conversely, the contrast SoE-V>SoE-NV revealed a greater increase in the right PC/PCC (x=14, y=−60, z=34, T=4.97, pFWE-corr=.039, cluster size=4 voxels) and the right cerebellum (x=10, y=−50, z=−20, T=5.31, pFWE-corr=.012, cluster size=12 voxels). However, the left amygdala and the bilateral cuneus did not exhibit a signiﬁcantly different increase with increasing SoE across the two domains. Furthermore, contrasts targeting general responses to verbal and nonverbal stimuli irrespective of SoE revealed more widely distributed patterns of activation (V>NV, NV>V and conjunction between V and NV, V∩NV, see Fig. 3A and Table 3). Categorical comparison of verbal versus nonverbal stimuli revealed a network including the left STS, bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL), bilateral temporal pole, left PC/PCC, left dmPFC, left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left inferior temporal gyrus and left middle occipital gyrus. The opposite comparison of nonverbal versus verbal stimuli demonstrated involvement of the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, bilateral FFG, the right posterior STS extending into the IPL, the right middle frontal gyrus extending into the IFG, bilateral superior occipital gyrus and cuneus and the right thalamus. Finally, regions commonly activated by both verbal and nonverbal stimuli included the left FFG, bilateral calcarine sulci and inferior occipital gyri, the SMA, the left IPL, the bilateral anterior insula, the superior PC, the bilateral thalamus and the left IFG.  The second analysis included both arousal ratings and absolute valence ratings as parametric modulators in order to control for the effect of stimulus arousal. This analysis replicated the former SoEeffects by showing increasing BOLD signal in the bilateral amygdala with increasing SoE for the nonverbal domain (x=−22, y=−10, z=−8, T=4.95, puncorr b.001, cluster size=284 voxels and x=32, y=−12, z=−16, T =4.50, puncorr b.001, cluster size=125 voxels). Similarly, the equivalent contrast for verbal stimuli revealed the precuneus (x=−10, y=−64, z=36, T=3.76, puncorr b.001, cluster size=15 voxels), the cerebellum (x=6, y=−44, z=−24, T =4.99, puncorr b.001, cluster size=549 voxels) and the cuneus (x=12, y= −78, z=12, T=4.50, puncorr b.001, cluster size=445 voxels). Thus, as the effects of the second parametric modulation in a model reveal only variance that had not been explained by the ﬁrst parametric modulation, we can rule out that the effect of the increasing SoE could be explained by differences in stimulus-related arousal ratings. Finally, the third analysis conﬁrmed that the effect of increasing SoE does not reﬂect the inﬂuence of valence per se because the effect of valent versus neutral ratings was similar for both positive and negative social judgments. By comparing positive and negative against neutral judgments, we fully replicated the results from the ﬁrst analysis (see Fig. 2B and Table 2, Val-V and Val-NV). In addition, direct comparisons between negative and positive verbal judgments (V− vs. V+ and V+ vs. V−) revealed no signiﬁcant results within the whole brain, or when inclusively masked with SoE-V, even at a more liberal threshold (puncorrb.001). Similarly, comparing negative and positive nonverbal judgments (NV− vs. NV+ and NV+ vs. NV−) revealed no differences when inclusively masked with SoE-NV, even at a more liberal threshold (puncorrb.001). The comparison between negative and positive nonverbal stimuli within the whole brain, i.e. without masking, however, revealed a signiﬁcantly stronger activation of the right superior temporal gyrus (x=42, y=−30, z=12, T=5.77, pFWE-corr=.001, cluster size=143 voxels) while no signiﬁcant whole brain effect was found for the opposite contrast (NV+ vs. NV−), even at a more liberal threshold (puncorr b.001).

These effects were detectible for both positive and negative evaluations and even after controlling for subjectively rated arousal of the stimuli. Although pretests showed that verbal and nonverbal stimuli evoked comparable person evaluations at the behavioral level, increasing evaluation strength was associated with the  bilateral amygdala for nonverbal stimuli and with the PC/PCC, bilateral cuneus and cerebellum for verbal stimuli. Hence, this ﬁnding indicates an involvement of qualitatively different cognitive processes during the evaluation of other persons dependent upon the stimulus domain.  Known to be a centerpiece of the affective system of the brain, the amygdala has been associated with diverse aspects of affective  184  B.

Providing further empirical support for its recruitment during the evaluation of other persons, our results also imply two more speciﬁc aspects: i) the amygdala was sensitive to changes in evaluation intensities, irrespective of valence; and ii) this response pattern was speciﬁc for nonverbal social information. In concordance with the ﬁrst point, the idea that the amygdala correlates with affective response intensities in a broad sense has recently received considerable empirical support. Overcoming the traditional conception that the amygdala is associated with negative valence only, neuroimaging studies (Anders et al., 2008; Sander and Scheich, 2001), as well as a quantitative meta-analysis (Sergerie et  al., 2008) have demonstrated its recruitment for the processing of positive stimuli as well. Speciﬁcally regarding face evaluation, recent studies have shown that both highly trustworthy as well as highly untrustworthy faces activated the amygdala yielding a nonlinear, Ushaped response pattern (Said et al., 2009; Todorov et al., 2008). Similarly, the amygdala was engaged during judgments of absolute valences of emotional faces (Gerber et al., 2008). Furthermore, neuroimaging studies focusing speciﬁcally on interpersonal judgments have demonstrated that both positive and negative judgments recruit the amygdala when evaluating famous people (Cunningham et al., 2004, 2008) or when forming evaluative impressions of social others (Schiller et al., 2009). In the same line, the present study revealed that the more the nonverbal behavior displayed by the target person induced a pronounced impression, indexed by a greater SoE, the higher was the BOLD signal in the amygdala. Thus, our ﬁndings provide further support for the concept that the amygdala is especially sensitive to varying intensities of salient social information, irrespective of valence (Sander et al., 2003).  The second aspect with regard to the involvement of the amygdala in our study is that its increasing response with increasing SoE was speciﬁc for nonverbal stimuli. This result extends the ﬁndings by Schiller et al. (2009) by highlighting a closer association of the differential response in the amygdala with nonverbal social information in the context of increasingly extreme interpersonal evaluation. Taking into account its extensive projections to the occipital cortex, the amygdala is well positioned to modulate visual processing based on affective signiﬁcance of the perceived input (Phelps and LeDoux, 2005; Vuilleumier and Pourtois, 2007). Consistently, converging evidence indicates its modulatory role in visual information processing, but not in recall and auditory induction methods of emotional responses (Phan et al., 2002). Furthermore, support for the speciﬁc sensitivity of the amygdala to nonverbal social cues has been provided by impairments in evaluating trustworthiness based on nonverbal, but not on verbal information in patients with amygdala lesions (Adolphs et al., 1998). Moreover, the recruitment of the amygdala for processing nonverbal stimuli has been shown to occur relatively independent of attentional resources or awareness, i.e., implicitly and automatically (Engell et al., 2007; Phelps and LeDoux, 2005; Phelps et al., 2000; Todorov and Engell, 2008; Winston et al., 2002). Although the essential role of the amygdala in the production of the social behavior has been questioned in prior studies on non-human primates, its role in detection of and reaction to especially threatening and hence signiﬁcant stimuli  A  V > NV   B  NV > V   C  V  NV  x = -54   x = 50   x = -38   x = -6   z = -18   x = -6   pFWE-corr<.05   Fig. 3.

Given that understanding information conveyed by conspeciﬁcs' nonverbal signals occurs early in phylogenetic and ontogenetic development and plays a special role in adaptive social behavior, our ﬁndings may reﬂect an evolutionary shaped recruitment of the amygdala in the rapid detection and decoding of biologically and socially relevant information (Phelps and LeDoux, 2005; Sergerie et al., 2008).  Interestingly, the presentation of verbal and of neutral nonverbal stimuli was accompanied by deactivations in the amygdala, especially in the right hemisphere (see Fig. 2). Such right amygdala deactivations have been demonstrated already early on, by comparing active and passive conditions of different experiments, i.e. conditions where stimulus presentations were paired with demanding tasks versus with no task (Schulman et al., 1997). Moreover, those experiments that  involved verbal processing tended to reveal larger deactivations in the right amygdala (Schulman et al., 1997). General task-induced deactivations are in accord with research demonstrating cognitive regulation of affective processing (Ochsner et al., 2002, 2004). Here, it has been shown that active cognitive computations were able to down-regulate affective processing and thereby decrease amygdala activity. Referring to neutral nonverbal stimuli in our study, the activity in the amygdala associated with detection of salient stimuli was possibly decreased simply because of the non-affective quality. Verbal stimuli, in contrast, may have induced a greater amount of high-level cognitive processing leading to a decreased activity of the amygdala as previously supposed by Freeman et al. (2010) for interpersonal judgments based on informative verbal stimuli. Additionally, paralleling patterns of activations have been demonstrated with other-race facial stimuli that increased the activation of the amygdala, while the perception of more neutral own-race facial stimuli resulted in slight deactivations (Lieberman et al., 2005). Furthermore, matching the race of the target face verbally and not via facial, i.e. nonverbal stimuli resulted in amygdala deactivations for both races (Lieberman et al., 2005).  On the other hand, our study highlights that when basing social judgments on verbal information, the BOLD signal increased in the PC/PCC, bilateral cuneus and cerebellum with increasing SoE. Thus, we replicated the ﬁndings by Schiller et al. (2009), who showed a speciﬁc involvement of the PCC in the evaluative component of impression formation and its parametric scaling with the SoE. Beyond this general functional characterization, we were able to demonstrate that the PC/PCC and its parametric activity changes are speciﬁcally associated with the processing of verbal stimuli. Consequently, our ﬁndings provide evidence for functional dissociations of ‘social brain’ regions based on the stimulus domain.  A similar dissociation has been demonstrated by a stronger involvement of the PCC in the processing of interpersonal judgments based on informative verbal material, while the amygdala was recruited when verbal stimuli were not informative and the judgment was reduced to an additionally presented face of the target person (Freeman et al., 2010). Our study extends these ﬁndings because it focuses speciﬁcally on the evaluative component of impression formation by making use of event-related subjective ratings instead of comparing two categories of person judgment irrespective of the subsequent outcome. Furthermore, due to the manipulation of both verbal and nonverbal stimuli in one experimental design, more valid conclusions about the inﬂuence and processing of the two domains can be derived from our study. Finally, in the present study both verbal and nonverbal information was individuated, i.e. related to idiosyncratic attributes and qualities of the target person indicated by social action descriptions and dynamic nonverbal communicative signals, respectively. Because nonverbal cues were displayed by the same virtual character, the content of social category knowledge extractable from the physical appearance such as gender, age, and race was identical across all nonverbal stimuli and could not serve as a basis for “superﬁcial” decisions. This procedure implicates that not simply the degree of individuation but also the domain of social information determines the involvement of differential brain regions in evaluation of social others. In general, the neurofunctional characterization of PCC has been more diverse than that of the amygdala. Social cognitive neuroscience research has assigned an important role to the PC/PCC in social inference including mentalizing, intention inference and impression formation (Lieberman, 2010) and in the interaction between episodic memory and the processing of emotionally salient words (Maddock, 1999; Maddock et al., 2003). Also, associations with the strength of evaluative judgments have been demonstrated by using verbal but not nonverbal stimuli (Maddock et al., 2003; Posner et al., 2009). At the same time, this region is characterized by its involvement in controlled, i.e., resource-limited processing in social cognitive tasks (Lieberman, 2010) and thus may also be associated with relatively deliberate processing. Thus, on a more speculative level, by revealing  186  B. Kuzmanovic et al. / NeuroImage 60 (2012) 179–188  the association of PC/PCC with the verbal and of the amygdala with the nonverbal domain, we provide indirect evidence for hypotheses made by dual-process theories of social judgments (Evans, 2008; Lieberman et al., 2002). Here, it has been suggested that the two domains evoke automatic and controlled cognitive operations to different degrees that are associated with closely interacting but distinguishable neural substrates.  The cuneus comprising primary and secondary visual areas and the cerebellum were also differentially recruited by increasing evaluation strength based on verbal stimuli. The involvement of the visual cortex may be explained by the increased mental imagery of behaviors described in the more inﬂuential verbal stimuli (Lambert et al., 2002), possibly due to a higher selective attention toward a more diagnostic information (Kastner and Ungerleider, 2000). Similarly, the activation of the cerebellum was frequently reported for language- and emotionrelated tasks (Stoodley and Schmahmann, 2009) and thus may represent a general increase of semantic and emotional processing of verbal stimuli with their increasing impact.  With regard to categorical comparisons of verbal and nonverbal stimuli, irrespective of the subsequent judgment, we could precisely replicate recent ﬁndings by Zaki et al. (2010) demonstrating domainspeciﬁc neural systems recruited when drawing inferences about emotional states of others based on either verbal or nonverbal social cues. A network related to mind state attribution including the dmPFC, the left PC/PCC and the bilateral temporal pole, as well as a left-lateralized network including inferior frontal, temporal and angular cortices associated with semantic processing (Price, 2000), were more strongly activated by verbal than by nonverbal stimuli. In contrast, nonverbal as compared to verbal stimuli more strongly engaged the right frontoparietal cortex corresponding to the putative human mirror neuron system (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004), as well as the right posterior STS, the bilateral FFG and the bilateral middle temporal gyrus including the area V5/MT+ involved in face and movement perception (Kanwisher and Yovel, 2006; Pelphrey et al., 2005; Wilms et al., 2005). Thus, our data support the notion that both the mentalizing and the mirror neuron system are involved in the general processing of social information about others, but obviously with different priorities for different domains (Zaki et al., 2010).  Critically, Zaki et al. (2010) also showed that when drawing inferences based on conﬂicting pairs of verbal and nonverbal information, activity in the right frontoparietal cortex and pSTS correlated with the relative reliance on nonverbal cues, whereas the activity in the left angular gyrus and mPFC correlated with the relative reliance on verbal cues. These results, however, must not be regarded as inconsistent with the domain-speciﬁc parametric modulation ﬁndings reported here because the two studies explored two different types of cognitive processes, namely person evaluation as opposed to inferences about emotional states of others. Moreover, the correlation of the activity in the amygdala with nonverbal and in the PC/PCC with verbal stimuli reported here was based on the strength of impression resulting from differentially salient unimodally presented information and not on the relative reliance on cues presented in a multimodal fashion.  Noteworthy, the activity in the dmPFC was not modulated by the increasing intensity of judgments for any domain, but was categorically stronger for processing verbal as compared to nonverbal person information. Thus, this ﬁnding provides additional evidence for the proposal that the dmPFC is not essential for the evaluative component of impression formation (Schiller et al., 2009). Rather, the dmPFC appears to be related to the general inferential processing of social information. Within the verbal domain, this inferential processing seems to occur regardless of information's diagnostic value as long as the instruction to form an impression is explicitly given evoking the continuous need to monitor social meanings (Mitchell et al., 2006). Similarly, in situations that speciﬁcally require an identiﬁcation of nonobservable mental states such as assessing deceptive intentions  (Grezes et al., 2004a), false beliefs (Grezes et al., 2004b), reasons for actions (Spunt et al., 2011), moment-to-moment emotional states (Zaki et al., 2009) or social relations (Iacoboni et al., 2004) the dmPFC has been recruited by nonverbal social cues as well. However, without such an explicit need for sophisticated inferential computation, nonverbal stimuli may convey observable and expressive cues therefore engaging the dmPFC to a lesser extent (Spunt et al., 2011; Zaki et al., 2010).  With respect to limitations of the study, it is important to note that both the source of information and the semantic content differed between the two domains: While nonverbal stimuli implied a “selfreport” with the target person presenting herself actively by the display of communicative expression and gesture, verbal stimuli were reputation-based and referred to descriptions of social actions. This approach was chosen because of its ecological validity as in everyday life we are frequently confronted with reputation-based verbal information about other persons' actions and nonverbal cues that are directly observed. Furthermore, verbal self-reports could induce the impression of target's self-projection that could inﬂuence the creditability of the given information. Although it is not indisputable that the differential SoE-effects for the two domains of information were neither inﬂuenced by the source of information nor by the semantic content, the comparison of the SoE-effect between the two domains as such is still valid because the SoE was computed separately within each domain. Furthermore, the differential recruitment of distant brain regions for the two domains is consistent with previous research in the related ﬁeld as described above. However, in future studies the source of social information should be taken into account, for example, by using statements about controversial topics instead of action descriptions as verbal stimuli. Such statements would indicate a self-report comparable to the nonverbal domain thereby avoiding problems with creditability. The difference between the semantic contents referring to actions or opinions on the one hand and to expressive nonverbal signals on the other is more difﬁcult to overcome, as these differences are inextricably constitutive of the verbal and nonverbal domain.  Another limitation is given by the use of female virtual characters only. This procedure was chosen in order to constrain the experimental design to the focus on the SoE effect by disregarding possible effects of the gender of the target person. However, it seems unlikely that similar effects would not occur also for male targets, because exactly such evaluation-related effects, but without a strict differentiation of the information domain, have been demonstrated in a study by Schiller et al. (2009), which used male target persons only and a gender-mixed sample of participants.  Furthermore, we only report the peaks of activation of isolated neural regions that do not provide any insights into the underlying neural networks. Further neuroimaging research should focus on methods targeting functional and anatomical connectivity in order to enrich our understanding of the neural mechanisms also on a network level of description. These methods could for example help to identify possible inﬂuences of increased attention to more informative and diagnostic social information resulting in more extreme judgments, which are not directly evident from the reported SoE effects.  Conclusions  The present study provides evidence for neurofunctional dissociation between the processing of verbal and nonverbal social information during interpersonal impression formation. Our results show that behaviorally similar social cognitive operations were driven by distinct neural networks when taking into account the kind of available information. While the inﬂuence of verbal stimuli on interpersonal judgments appears to rely on the PC/PCC, previously associated with information shapes mental  state inferences, nonverbal  social  B.

Instead of delineating these neurofunctional dissociations, however, in terms of independent dichotomies, it rather seems useful to characterize them as complementary parts of a complex interaction related to additional cognitive functions such as attention and memory. To explore these aspects further will be an important objective of future research. The question to what extent rapid, affective processes determine our social judgments and how this may relate to the presence of visual images has far reaching implications given the inﬂuence of impression formation on future expectations, decisions and behavior toward other persons. Due to the wide presence and increasing availability of visually transmitted information in today's media, this question is likely to take on even greater signiﬁcance in the future.

Here, we show that ToM can also be maladaptive when people interact with complex modern institutions like ﬁnancial markets. We tested participants who were investing in an experimental bubble market, a situation in which the price of an asset is much higher than its underlying fundamental value. We describe a mechanism by which social signals computed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex affect value computations in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, thereby increasing an individual’s propensity to ‘ride’ ﬁnancial bubbles and lose money. These regions compute a ﬁnancial metric that signals variations in order ﬂow intensity, prompting inference about other traders’ intentions. Our results suggest that incorporating inferences about the intentions of others when making value judgments in a complex ﬁnancial market could lead to the formation of market bubbles.  INTRODUCTION  In February 1637 in Amsterdam, the cost of a single exotic tulip bulb reached a price equal to ten times what a skilled craftsman earned in a year. The price of the same bulb collapsed a few days later. The dramatic rise and fall of tulip bulb prices is a famous historical example of a ﬁnancial bubble (Kindleberger and Aliber, 2005). A bubble is conventionally deﬁned by active trading of an asset at prices that are considerably higher than its intrinsic fundamental value. Examples of modern bubbles include Japanese stocks in the 1990s, the US high-tech sector in the late 1990s, and housing prices, which rose and crashed in many countries from 2000–2008. All of these bubbles (especially the housing crash) caused long-lasting macroeconomic disruptions (Shiller, 2005).  Modern bubble episodes have also led to a substantial shift in thinking about the capacity of prices to act as sober information  aggregation mechanisms that guide efﬁcient allocation of capital. Policy makers, academics, and market participants alike are now more familiar with, and groping to understand, the ways that prices can reﬂect pathological valuation and are actively debating whether policy interventions can help (Akerlof and Shiller, 2009).  Despite these dramatic historical and modern examples, there is no well-accepted theory of how bubbles start and end. One common deﬁnition of bubbles is rapid price appreciation followed by a crash (Brunnermeier, 2008). However, this deﬁnition has no predictive power for identifying an ongoing bubble, since it does not identify a bubble before it crashes. Furthermore, fundamental asset values are rarely known with precision, so it is difﬁcult to identify a bubble if bubbles are deﬁned as prices above an elusive fundamental value.  One way to learn about bubbles is to observe trading in an experimental market for artiﬁcial assets that have a known fundamental value. In these markets, price variation cannot be explained by changes in fundamentals. In fact, several carefully controlled economics experiments have shown that certain classes of asset markets do generate price bubbles quite regularly, even when intrinsic values are easy to compute and are known to traders (Smith et al., 1988; Camerer and Weigelt, 1993; Porter and Smith, 2003; Lei et al., 2004). The nature of bubbles has also been intensely investigated in theory (Abreu and Brunnermeier, 2003; Yu and Xiong, 2011), but empirical reasons why bubbles arise and then crash are still not well understood in economics (Xiong, 2013).  Recent work in neuroeconomics has shown how ﬁnancial decision theory can be informed by neuroscientiﬁc data (Bossaerts, 2009). In particular, studies have started to dissect the neural mechanisms by which risk processing (Preuschoff et al., 2008), anticipatory affect (Knutson and Bossaerts, 2007; Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005), ﬁctive learning signals (Lohrenz et al., 2007), inference about information possessed by other traders (Bruguier et al., 2010), and mental accounting of trading outcomes (C. Frydman, personal communication) shape ﬁnancial decisions. However, the neural mechanisms underpinning the formation of a ﬁnancial bubble are still unknown. Understanding of these mechanisms could prove critical in distinguishing between alternative hypotheses, each requiring different macroeconomic interventions.  1222 Neuron 79, 1222–1231, September 18, 2013 ª2013 The Authors  Neuron  Theory of Mind Biases Values in Financial Bubbles  This study, which combines experimental ﬁnance settings together with behavioral modeling and neuroimaging methods, aims to identify the neural coding scheme at the core of bubble formation. We focus here on how the representation of assets trading values in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a brain region heavily involved in representing goal value (Rangel et al., 2008; Boorman et al., 2009; Chib et al., 2009; Hare et al., 2009; Levy and Glimcher, 2012), are modulated by formation of a bubble. Our hypothesis is that the increase in prices observed in bubble markets is associated with the neural representation of inﬂated trading values in vmPFC, which produces an enhanced susceptibility to buying assets at prices exceeding their fundamental value. We test the hypothesis that the inﬂated values are caused by participants’ maladaptive attempts to forecast the intentions of other players in a fast-growing market. In particular, we propose that the more dorsal portion of the prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a region well known to represent the mental state of other individuals (also known as theory of mind; ToM) (Frith and Frith, 2003; Amodio and Frith, 2006; Hampton et al., 2008), is involved in updating the value computation in vmPFC, stimulating the formation of a ﬁnancial bubble. In order to clarify the role played by intentions in modulating activity in these brain regions during ﬁnancial bubbles, we introduce a computational concept from ﬁnancial theory. This metric captures the dynamic changes from a steady, regular arrival of buying and selling orders to a more variable arrival process (perhaps signaling the start of a bubble, as orders arrive rapidly due to excitement, or an impending crash, when orders arrive slowly as traders hold their breath) that can signal the presence of strategic agents in a market. Activity in medial prefrontal regions is correlated with this index more strongly in bubble markets than in nonbubble markets and is associated with the individual’s propensity to ride the ﬁnancial bubble.  RESULTS  Experimental Markets Twenty-one participants were scanned while trading in experimental markets. Trading activity in six actual experimental markets (collected in previous behavioral studies; Porter and Smith, 2003) was replayed over a 2-day scanning schedule. On each day, the participants traded in three experimental markets. Each market was divided into ﬁfteen trading periods. During each trading period, the scanned participants observed a fastmotion visual representation of the prices of offers to sell (asks) and offers to buy (bids), which were actually inputted by the participants who had taken part in the original behavioral experiments.  Subjects started with a cash endowment of $60. The screen was frozen at random intervals (2–3 times each period). At these freeze points, participants were allowed to stay (do nothing) or buy or sell one, two, or three shares at the current market price by pressing a keypad. After the choice was inputted, an update of the participants’ portfolio (number of the shares held and cash) was presented on the screen. This was followed by a variable resting phase. At the end of each of the ﬁfteen periods, the trading activity was interrupted, and participants were shown the dividend paid to the shareholder for that period.  The traded assets paid a dividend worth an expected value of $0.24 in each period to subjects who held those assets. Therefore, the intrinsic expected value of buying and holding assets was initially $3.60. The assets’ intrinsic value (fundamental value) declined by $0.24 after each period (since there were fewer future dividends lying ahead). The asset value in period t was therefore $0.24 3 (15   t + 1) (see Experimental Procedures for more details).  Three of the six sessions used in the study were nonbubble markets; in those sessions, the market prices were tracking the fundamental value of the asset closely (Figure 1A). The other three sessions were bubble markets, in which market prices rose well above the intrinsic value in later periods (Figure 1B; Figure S1 available online).  Behavioral Results Our initial approach was to quantify how participants’ choices (i.e., buy, sell, or stay) were inﬂuenced by market parameters such as bid and ask prices and fundamental values. We performed an ordered logistic regression using participants’ choices (i.e., buy, sell, or stay) as dependent variables and market prices and fundamental values as independent variables. The parameter estimates showed that in both the bubble and nonbubble markets, the participants’ behavior was signiﬁcantly modulated by prices and fundamental values, but that those two factors explained less variance in the bubble markets data (pseudo R2 = 0.27; Bayesian information criterion [BIC] = 2,089) than in nonbubble (pseudo R2 = 0.33; BIC = 1,840). Notably, there was a signiﬁcant difference between bubble and nonbubble market coefﬁcients computed for prices (t test: t = 3.48; p < 0.05) and for fundamental value (t test: t = 4.24; p < 0.001). Coefﬁcients for prices and fundamentals together with a summary statistics are presented in Table 1. These results suggest that during ﬁnancial bubbles, participants’ choices are less driven by explicit information available in the market (i.e., prices and fundamentals) and are more driven by other computational processes, perhaps imagining the path of future prices and likely behavior of other traders.  To further investigate this issue, we measured how the neural representation of value changes when participants trade assets in bubble markets compared with nonbubble markets (using fMRI). Our hypothesis was that the increased trade volume in bubble markets should be associated with an inﬂated representation of portfolio proﬁts. We reasoned that if the formation of bubbles is a consequence of inﬂated value representation, a brain region that codes for parametric changes in trading values should have increased activity when participants trade in bubble markets.  Value Computation To test this hypothesis, we constructed a parametric variable that captured the trial-by-trial variance in the value of each participant’s trading position. We called this variable current portfolio value (CPV), a combination of the value in cash and in shares held by a participant (or trader) at each point in time (CPV[t] = cash + [shares 3 fundamental value at time t]). CPV was used as a parametric regressor in a general linear model to isolate signal changes  in blood-oxygen-level-dependent  (BOLD)  Neuron 79, 1222–1231, September 18, 2013 ª2013 The Authors 1223  Theory of Mind Biases Values in Financial Bubbles  Neuron  Figure 1. Task (A) Structure of the task: at the beginning of each period, participants were shown a message stating the period number and the value of their portfolio (shares and cash). This was followed by a video showing an intuitive graphical replay of the order (asks and bids) and trade ﬂow. The orders were arranged by price level (see illustrative diagram on the right corner). Whenever a trade occurred, the best bid (if a sale) or best ask (if a purchase) brieﬂy (0.5 s) changed color to green, after which the circle disappeared. The circles constantly rearranged to ensure that the best bid and ask circles were closest to the midpoint of the screen (for more details see Bruguier et al., 2010). After a variable time interval (3–6 s), the screen was frozen for 5 s, and subjects used their initial endowment of $60 to either buy or sell (1, 2, or 3 shares) or stay by pressing a keypad. At the end of the choice period, an update screen summarized their current portfolio (i.e., cash and shares). This was followed by a resting period (3–6 s). At the end of each period (15 periods in total), a dividend was randomly extracted from (0¢ 8¢ 28¢ 60¢), and subjects paid for the number of shares held (in the case of short selling, subjects had to pay the cost of the dividend for the number of negative shares held). The dividend for that period was displayed to the subjects with an update of their portfolio. (B and C) Asks (red) and bid (blue) plotted against the fundamental prices (dotted line) for one of the three nonbubble markets (B) and one of the three bubble markets (C) replayed during the experiment. In the nonbubble markets condition (B), asks and bids track the fundamental price over time, while in the bubble markets condition (C), asks and bids deviate from the fundamental prices. All six of the markets used in the study are plotted in the Supplemental Information.  underpinning the increased representation of trading values during bubble markets compared to nonbubble markets. This analysis yielded a signiﬁcant interaction in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC peak [3, 53,  2], t = 3.48; p < 0.05 small volume correction [SVC] for multiple comparison), a brain region that plays a key role in encoding the goal values that are used to guide choice (Figure 2A; for a complete list of activations see also Figure S1). We therefore conﬁrmed, consistent with our initial hypothesis, that the parametric representation of the portfolio value (CPV) was increased during bubble markets. This is illustrated by the pattern of activity in vmPFC (percent BOLD signal changes) in response to increasing levels of CPV in both bubble and nonbubble markets (Figure 2B).  We next reasoned that if inﬂated trading values represented in vmPFC play a role in the formation of a ﬁnancial bubble, activity in this region should predict the behavioral tendency to buy shares when their prices are above the fundamental values (a behavior that stimulates and sustains the formation of a ﬁnancial bubble). To test this, we constructed an independent parameter that quantiﬁed the participants’ tendency to ride the bubble. We called this between-subject index ‘‘bubble susceptibility,’’ which is the extra price paid by participants to purchase shares at prices above the fundamental value (see Experimental Procedures for more details).  We then entered this bubble susceptibility index as a between-subjects covariate in the parametric general linear model  1224 Neuron 79, 1222–1231, September 18, 2013 ª2013 The Authors  Neuron  Theory of Mind Biases Values in Financial Bubbles  Table 1.

This analysis yielded a signiﬁcant correlation in vmPFC (peak [ 6, 50, 1]; t = 3.44; p < 0.05 SVC for multiple comparisons). More precisely, activity in vmPFC was a signiﬁcant predictor of the behavioral tendency to ride bubbles (Figure 3). Note that while the overall buying at prices above the fundamental value was a relatively rare phenomenon (see Figures S2 and S3), riding the bubble (in the context of our experimental setup) was clearly a suboptimal behavior, as demonstrated by the fact that those participants with high susceptibly to ride the bubble had signiﬁcantly lower monetary earnings (p = 0.02), an effect due to only trading in bubble markets (nonbubble markets: p > 0.1; bubble markets: p = 0.005). Critically, low monetary earnings did not directly correlate with activity in vmPFC (p = 0.19), excluding the possibility that the correlation we identiﬁed in this region reﬂected increasing susceptibility to reduced earnings (independent of bubble susceptibility).  Theory of Mind Our next step was to investigate the mechanism causing the inﬂation in value representation observed in vmPFC during ﬁnancial bubbles. The key difference between nonbubble markets and bubble markets is that in nonbubble markets, the value of a share is only determined by the fundamental value of the asset, while in bubble markets, proﬁtable trading depends on accurately judging the intentions of other players in the market. Therefore, we hypothesized that the increase in value representation during a bubble market was a consequence of the fact that traders use inferences about the intentions and mental states of other agents to update their value representation. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that in our whole-brain analysis, together with increased activity in vmPFC, we isolated a network of brain regions that have previously been associated with theory of mind (Siegal and Varley, 2002; Frith and Frith, 2006; Saxe, 2006), such as temporoparietal junction (L-TPJ; [ 48,  52, 25], t = 3.68), precuneus ([6,  43, 49], t = 4.9), and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC; [9, 50, 28], t = 3.47) (Figure 3A; for a complete list of activations see also Table S1).  In particular, we focused on dmPFC because convergent evidence suggests that this region of the prefrontal cortex plays a primary role in human ability to make inferences about the mental states (including intentions) of other agents (Siegal and Varley, 2002; Amodio and Frith, 2006), enabling strategic thinking (Hampton et al., 2008). Furthermore, a previous study has shown  that in experimental ﬁnancial markets, activity in this area correlates with participants’ ability to predict price changes in markets due the presence of informed insider traders in the market (Bruguier et al., 2010).  If activity isolated in dmPFC during bubble markets reﬂected mentalizing ToM activity, then we would expect a measure of neural signal change in that region during bubble markets to be associated with individual-speciﬁc measures of ToM. To test this hypothesis further, we retested a subset of participants (n = 14) who had originally participated in the bubble experiment using an online version of the eye gaze test to assess their ToM skills (Baron Cohen et al., 2001). In this task, participants looked at eye gazes and picked one of four terms that best described the mental state of the person whose eyes were shown (see Experimental Procedures). The task has correct answers, from which we constructed an index of the ToM ability of each participant. We then extracted the percentage of signal change in dmPFC in response to CPV during bubble markets (in the 8 mm sphere centered at [9, 50, 28]) for each subject and found a substantial correlation between that signal change and each subject’s ToM ability index (Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient r = 0.57; p < 0.05) (Figure 4). Critically, no signiﬁcant correlation between dmPFC signal and the ToM index was found during nonbubble markets (r = 0.32; p > 0.1). Furthermore, we repeated the same analysis in vmPFC (in the 8 mm sphere centered at [3, 53,  2]), which showed that activity in vmPFC did not correlate with performance in the ToM task in either the bubble (r = 0.06; p > 0.5) or the nonbubble markets (r = 0.09; p > 0.5). Taken together, these ﬁndings supported our hypothesis that the increased activity in dmPFC that we isolated during the ﬁnancial bubbles reﬂected a computation associated with the participants’ tendency to make inferences about the mental states of other players in the market. An intriguing possibility is that participants during the ﬁnancial bubble, rather than mentalizing the intentions of individual players, would represent the whole market as an intentional agent in the attempt to forecast the future intentions of the market.  Notably, unlike in vmPFC, activity in dmPFC isolated in this contrast did not correlate signiﬁcantly (r = 0.009; p > 0.5) with the individual’s susceptibility to ride a ﬁnancial bubble, as measured by the bubble susceptibility index. These results suggested that the neural circuit that modulated the value representation in vmPFC (associated with the behavioral susceptibility to ride a ﬁnancial bubble) might be inﬂuenced by the social computations instantiated in dmPFC during the update of participants’ CPV. In order to test this hypothesis, we then conducted a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis between vmPFC and dmPFC. This analysis revealed that the functional coupling between these two regions signiﬁcantly increased during bubble markets (p < 0.001; Figure 5), suggesting that investors might update their portfolio proﬁts in vmPFC by taking into account the intentions of the other players in the market. We therefore devised a model-based analysis to investigate this idea in more detail.  Intentionality To study how intentions modulate market traders’ computations, we studied how subjects inferred intentional agency from  Neuron 79, 1222–1231, September 18, 2013 ª2013 The Authors 1225  Theory of Mind Biases Values in Financial Bubbles  Neuron  Figure 2.

As PID grows, the evidence against the null hypothesis of no change in arrival rate increases (Figure 6A; Figure S4).  Using this model, we were then able to construct a parametric regressor for each subject, measuring inferred intention over time. The regressor averaged the value of PID over the period in which the subject observed the arrival of asks and bids in the market (see Experimental Procedures).  Critically, this parametric regressor was uncorrelated with either CPV (r = 0.06 ± 0.02) or the deviation in prices from the fundamental values (r = 0.001 ± 0.09). Changes in PID were then input as a parametric regressor in a general linear model to test whether activity in vmPFC and dmPFC showed a greater modulation to this metric during a contrast between bubble markets versus nonbubble markets (analogously to the contrast using CPV as modulator). We then extracted the signal in both regions of interest (using an 8 mm sphere centered at [3, 53,  2] for vmPFC and [9, 50, 28] for dmPFC). This analysis yielded a signiﬁcant result in both regions in medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC: t = 1.83, p < 0.05 and dmPFC: t = 1.77, p < 0.05). We then tested how this activity in medial prefrontal cortex covaried with the susceptibility to ride the bubble (i.e., correlation with bubble susceptibility index). A signiﬁcant correlation in most of the medial prefrontal cortex (Figure 6B), including the two regions of interest, vmPFC (r = 0.46; p < 0.001) and dmPFC (r = 0.68; p < 0.001), was isolated as a result of this analysis (Figure 6C; for a complete list of activations, see also Table S1).  DISCUSSION  Understanding why ﬁnancial bubbles occur is a challenging problem that has been intensively investigated, with no clear results. Several scholars have recently started to explore the neural mechanisms underpinning human behavior during ﬁnancial interactions (Knutson and Bossaerts, 2007; Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005; 2011; Lohrenz et al., 2007), along with psychophysiological (Lo and Repin, 2002) and hormonal measures (Coates and Herbert, 2008). However, nothing is known about the neural computation underpinning traders’ behavior during ﬁnancial bubbles. Here, we show that neuroscientiﬁc data can help make sense of market behavior that is anomalous for standard ﬁnancial theory (Yu and Xiong, 2011) by emphasizing the role played by traders’ theory of mind in artiﬁcially inﬂating the value of portfolio proﬁts.  changes in the arrival of buy and sell orders. Recall that subjects see a fast-motion replay of all orders to buy (bids), and all orders to sell (asks), which were entered in the original behavioral experiments. Paying careful attention to this ﬁne-grained sequence of buy and sell orders could form a basis for predicting trader intentions (a relative of sentiment in ﬁnancial economics; Baker and Wurgler, 2007). To translate this idea into a precise computational variable, we use a recent precise measure from ﬁnancial theory. The intuitive idea is that the presence of strategic agents in a market can be inferred by a statistical change in the order arrival process, from a homogeneous Poisson process to a mixture process (where the arrival intensity switches randomly) (Easley et al., 1997). The idea is that any increase in trader information, or even a perception of such an increase, will change order arrival. For example, orders may arrive more rapidly as traders try to trade quickly before information leaks out, or orders may thin out as traders place orders more cautiously, afraid of being on the wrong end of a trade against a better-informed partner (Easley et al., 2002).  We therefore constructed a statistic that measured the dynamic of breaks in Poisson homogeneity during trading. We called this metric Poisson inhomogeneity detector (PID). PID is a statistic that increases as the evidence against a homogenous Poisson order arrival process increases over the recent past. Speciﬁcally, it tests whether the number of arrivals in the last interval of 9 s conforms to a Poisson distribution with ﬁxed arrival intensity. This measure, ﬁrst proposed and investigated by Brown and Zhao (2002), has good statistical power (in small samples) to reject the null hypothesis of homogenous arrival in favor of the alternative that the arrival rates obtain from Poisson distributions with different arrival rates across the M intervals. iði = 1; .; MÞ, and  Letting xi denote the number of arrivals in interval      1=2  yi =  xi + 3 8  ;  (Equation 1)  then the PID is deﬁned as  Xi  PID = 4  ðyðiÞ   YÞ2;  (Equation 2)  m  where Y equals the average (across M intervals) of the values of yi.

Bubble Susceptibility Index (A) Activity in vmPFC is positively modulated by the individual propensity to ride a ﬁnancial bubble. Between-subject regression analysis entering the bubble susceptibility index (i.e., the extra price paid by participants to purchase shares at prices above the fundamental value during the whole experiment) as a covariate for the increase in CPV response during bubble markets in vmPFC (peak [x, y, z] =  6, 50, 1; Z = 3; p < 0.05 small volume FWE corrected). (B) Scatter plot showing the parameter estimates for each participant. Note that the scatter plot is shown here solely for illustrative purposes (e.g., absence of outliers), and it is not used for statistical inference (which was carried out in the SPM framework).  Standard asset pricing theory assumes that competitive markets are nonstrategic and nonintentional (i.e., payoffs depend only on the price, which one cannot inﬂuence). On the contrary, our behavioral results show that the explicit information carried by prices and fundamental values accounts for signiﬁcantly less variance in choice behavior when subjects are trading in bubble markets. When we tested how trading in bubble markets modulated the representation of trading values in vmPFC, we showed that these values are differentially represented in vmPFC. More speciﬁcally, trading in the context of a ﬁnancial bubble is associated with inﬂated value representations in vmPFC. Many studies show that vmPFC plays a key role in valuation and goal-directed choices (Rangel et al., 2008; Boorman et al., 2009; Chib et al., 2009; FitzGerald et al., 2009; Hare et al., 2009; Levy and Glimcher, 2012). Contextual factors have a powerful effect in modulating the neural representation of goal values in vmPFC and therefore affect choice (Plassmann et al., 2008; De Martino et al., 2009). For example, inﬂated value representation in vmPFC has been previously shown to affect prices, causing a behavior known as money illusion (Weber et al., 2009). This behavior is associated with vmPFC tracking the inﬂated nominal value even when the actual purchasing value remains unchanged.  Investigating changes in value representation in vmPFC, we were able to show a correlation between the propensity to ride a bubble (measured with the bubble susceptibility index) and activity in this region. Note that in our experiment, participants could ride the bubble, but not directly inﬂuence its formation, due to the nature of the experimental design. However, this situation is analogous to real ﬁnancial markets in which the action of a single trader very rarely has a detectable impact on the whole market. We then sought to clarify the role played in this process by participants’ attempts to forecast the intentions of other players or of the market as an intentional agent.  In fact, while standard ﬁnancial theory assumes that competitive markets are nonstrategic, it is not uncommon for people to assign intentionality to markets. Financial commentators often say, anthropomorphically, that ‘‘markets are panicking’’ or ‘‘markets are losing conﬁdence.’’ Assigning intention or agency is a natural way for humans to model and interpret complex behavior (as in the case of simple societies in which human-like gods are thought to control natural processes such as the weather). Hu mans live in social environments and therefore usually beneﬁt from ToM abilities that allow them to forecast the intentions of others and take preventive actions (Fehr and Camerer, 2007; Frith and Frith, 1999; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Sanfey, 2007), an ability instantiated in medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Frith and Frith, 2006).  Using an independent ToM task (Baron Cohen et al., 2001), we showed that the increase of activity isolated during the bubble markets correlates with the individual ability in ToM. Furthermore, we showed that the functional coupling between dmPFC and vmPFC was increased during bubble markets. We interpreted these results by proposing a putative mechanism that produces the increase in value sensitivity that we observed in vmPFC while participants traded in the context of bubble markets. These data suggest that during ﬁnancial bubbles, participants are taking into account the intention of other players in the market (or of the market as whole) while updating their value estimates, and that this effect is mediated by the interaction between dmPFC and vmPFC. This interpretation ﬁts with previous studies that have highlighted the role of dmPFC in shaping value computation by showing that social signals change the way in which values are updated through reinforcement learning (Behrens et al., 2008; Hampton et al., 2008; Behrens et al., 2009; Suzuki et al., 2012). For example, activity in dmPFC correlates with the likelihood that participants playing a ‘‘work-or-shirk’’ strategic game learn the value of an action using a model that takes into consideration the intentions of the other players in the game (Hampton et al., 2008). A recent study by Nicolle and colleagues (Nicolle et al., 2012) has proposed that dmPFC is not speciﬁcally involved in mentalizing but has a more general role in representing the values of actions that are modeled but not executed while vmPFC is involved in representing only those values that are relevant for the decision maker’s executed choice. According to this framework, a complementary interpretation of our results is that the activity in dmPFC reﬂects a computation of value associated with modeled alternative choices (e.g., buying at different prices from the fundamental value) that are especially relevant for traders during bubble markets, when the price path is highly variable.  To provide further support to the hypothesis that the attempt to forecast the intentions of other players or of the market plays a key role in modulating the susceptibility to ﬁnancial bubbles,  Neuron 79, 1222–1231, September 18, 2013 ª2013 The Authors 1227  Theory of Mind Biases Values in Financial Bubbles  Neuron  Figure 4. ToM Signals in dmPFC (A) Increased response to parametric changes in CPV in bubble markets versus nonbubble markets. dmPFC (peak [x, y, z] = 9, 50, 28; Z = 3.44; p < 0.05 small volume FWE corrected) is positively modulated in bubble markets. (B) Percentage of signal change extracted in this region (8 mm sphere) during bubble markets positively correlates (Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient r = 0.57; p < 0.05) with the ToM eye score collected for a subset of participants (n = 14) in a subsequent behavioral study. Notably, no signiﬁcant correlation between ToM score and activity in dmPFC was isolated in nonbubble market conditions (r = 0.32; p > 0.1).  we devised a new statistic, the PID, to interrogate our neural data using a model-based approach. The rationale behind this analysis was suggested by recent ﬁnancial models that have proposed that the presence of intentionality in the market (i.e., strategic agents in ﬁnancial terms) can be inferred by changes in the order arrival process from a homogeneous Poisson process to a mixture process whereby orders arrive in clusters, followed by periods of unusually low activity (as if traders were holding their breath). Finance theory (Easley et al., 1997) and some experimental evidence (Camerer and Weigelt, 1991) suggest that a change in order arrival indicates the presence of traders who are better informed or who are perceived to be better informed. Therefore, the PID statistic can be considered a measure of the intensity of the perceived winner’s curse and hence of inferred intention in the marketplace. Note that even in the absence of strategic players in the market, it is sufﬁcient that participants perceive (and believe) that there are agents with an information advantage, i.e., that there are agents who make better guesses about when a bubble may crash (Abreu and Brunnermeier, 2003). This metric allowed us to measure if activity in vmPFC and dmPFC was positively modulated during bubble markets in response to change in the level of perceived intentionality in these markets.  It is important to highlight that while the PID statistic shows ﬂuctuations in the nonbubble markets too (primarily in the initial periods in which bids are below the fundamental value, a standard feature of all types of experimental markets), activity in these prefrontal regions speciﬁcally responds to change in intentionality (perceived or real) during the bubble markets, a type of market in which the fundamental values are not sufﬁcient to predict the future evolution of prices.  Our analyses showed that both regions were positively modulated by the PID parameter during bubble markets and that activity in the dorsal and ventral regions of the medial prefrontal cortex showed a positive modulation with the susceptibility to ride ﬁnancial bubbles. It is worth noting that the PID parameter is orthogonal to the CPV parameter used in the ﬁrst analysis, so the PID analysis is likely to pick up different computational processes carried out by the same regions. Taken together, these data provide further support that forecasting intention plays a key role in modulating the regions in medial prefrontal cortex that we have identiﬁed to be involved in ToM and value computation during the representation of trading values in ﬁnancial bubbles. However, the exact way in which these different  computations interact to shape behavior needs to be investigated in further detail using tailored experimental paradigms. We also want to emphasize that our study does not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms (such as anticipatory affective response), which have been demonstrated to lead to ﬁnancial mistakes (Wu et al., 2012, Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005), might also play a pivotal role in the formation of bubbles. Financial bubbles are complex and multidimensional phenomena, and the identiﬁcation of the neural mechanisms underpinning their formation requires the combination of a number of different approaches.  In conclusion, in this study we showed how the same computational mechanisms that have been extremely advantageous in our evolutionary history (such as the one that allows people to take into account the intentions of other agents when computing values) could result in maladaptive behaviors when interacting with complex modern institutions like ﬁnancial markets. However, it must be noted that these abilities are not always maladaptive in a ﬁnancial milieu. For example, traders can successfully use their ToM abilities to detect the presence of insiders in the market (Bruguier et al., 2010), inducing traders to become more cautious in order to avoid being taken advantage of by a better-informed trading partner and improving the estimation of prices. Overall, our work suggests that a neurobiological account of trading behavior (Bossaerts, 2009) that takes into account theory of mind can provide a mechanistic explanation of ﬁnancial concepts such as limited-rationality investing (Fehr and Camerer, 2007). The insights that this study gives into the underlying computational mechanisms that lead to bubble formation can also potentially beneﬁt policymakers in designing more efﬁcient social and ﬁnancial institutions.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Participants Twenty-six undergraduate and graduate Caltech students took part in the original 2-day scanning study. Because of potential gender differences in ﬁnancial and social behavior (Powell and Ansic, 1997; Eckel and Grossman, 2008; Byrnes et al., 1999; Bertrand, 2011), the study included males only. Five subjects were excluded from the analysis because of technical problems at the time of the scanning or excessive head movements.  fMRI task Trading activity in six actual experimental markets (collected in previous behavioral studies; Porter and Smith, 2003) was replayed over a 2 day  1228 Neuron 79, 1222–1231, September 18, 2013 ª2013 The Authors  Neuron  Theory of Mind Biases Values in Financial Bubbles  of  5.

Error bars represent SEM.  scanning schedule. Three of the markets used in the study were nonbubble markets; in these markets, the market prices closely tracked the fundamental value of the asset. The other three markets were bubble markets, in which market prices rose well above the intrinsic value (see Figure S1). On each day, the participants traded in three experimental markets selected in a pseudorandom order (to avoid three consecutive markets of the same type being presented in the same day). The duration of each market was approximately 15 min. Participants started each new session with a cash endowment of $60 and zero shares. Each market was divided into ﬁfteen trading periods. At the beginning of each period, participants were shown a message stating the period number and the value of their portfolio (shares and cash). This was followed by a video showing an intuitive graphical replay of the order (asks and bids) and trade ﬂow. The scanned participants observed a fast-motion visual representation of the prices of offers to sell (asks) and offers to buy (bids), which were actually inputted by the participants who had taken part in the original behavioral experiments. The orders were arranged by price level (see illustrative diagram on the right corner of Figure 1). Whenever a trade occurred, the best bid (if a sale) or best ask (if a purchase) brieﬂy (0.5 s) changed color to green, after which the circle disappeared. The circles constantly rearranged to ensure that the best bid and ask circles were closest to the midpoint of the screen (this graphical representation of the trades was a modiﬁcation of an fMRI task used by Bruguier and collegues (Bruguier et al., 2010). After a variable time interval (3–6 s), the screen was frozen for 5 s, and participants used their initial endowment of $60 to either buy or sell (1, 2, or 3 shares) or stay by pressing a keypad. The intervals in which choices were made (choice intervals) were presented 2–3 times during each of the 15 periods composing each market. After the choice was inputted (5 s choice interval), an update of the participant’s portfolio (number of the shares held and cash) was presented on the screen. At the end of each period (15 periods in total for each market), a dividend was randomly extracted from a uniform distribution of (0¢ 8¢ 28¢ 60¢), and participants were then paid for the number of shares held. Participants were also allowed to short sell shares for a total maximum of 52 shares. In cases of short selling, participants had to pay the cost of the dividend for the number of negative shares held. At the end of each period, the dividend for that period was displayed to the participants with an update of their portfolio. For full instructions given to the participants’ in advance of the experiment, please see Appendix 1 in the Supplemental Information.  ToM Task All participants that took part in the original experiment were contacted via e-mail and asked to complete an online modiﬁcation of the eye gaze ToM task (Baron Cohen et al., 2001). Seven of the twenty-one participants that took part in the original fMRI study did not respond to our request. The remaining fourteen participants who did complete the online testing received a $10 Amazon voucher as compensation. During the test, participants were shown 36 photographs of eye gazes in a consecutive sequence, and they were asked to pick one term from four possible descriptions of the person whose eyes were portrayed in the photo (for example, anxious, thoughtful, skeptical, suspicious).  variables were the participants’ choices coded as trinary variables (i.e., buy, sell, or stay), while the two dependent measures were market prices (average of best bid and best ask available in the choice period) and fundamental asset value for the current period ($0.24 3 [15   t + 1]) (dashed line in Figures 1C and 1D). For each model, we reported the Nagelkerke pseudo R2 (Nagelkerke, 1991) and the BIC (Kass and Raftery, 1995).  Scanning Acquisition Forty-ﬁve slices were acquired on a 3T Siemens Trio at a resolution of 3 mm 3 3 mm 3 3 mm, providing whole-brain coverage. A single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence was used (TR = 2800 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV =  ). The images were collected at a tilted angle of 30 100 mm, ﬂip angle = 80 from the anterior commissure. For each subject, at the end of the ﬁrst scanning day (day 1), the EPI functional scanning was followed by a whole-brain, highresolution, T1-weighted anatomical structural scan and local ﬁeld maps.    fMRI-SPM Analyses Image analysis was performed using SPM8 (http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/ spm/). The ﬁrst ﬁve volumes from each session were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. Raw functional, structural, and ﬁeld map ﬁles were reconstructed using TBR. Field maps were reconstructed into a single-phase ﬁle. This ﬁeld map ﬁle was then used to realign and unwarp EPI functional images. Structural images were reregistered to mean EPI images and segmented into gray and white matter. These segmentation parameters were then used to normalize and bias correct the functional images. Normalized images were smoothed using an 8 mm full-width Gaussian kernel at half-maximum (FWHM). A GLM was constructed in which onset regressors (beginning at the start of each video) for each session were assembled by convolving d functions with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). These regressors were modulated by a parametric regressor coding for the CPV, a combination of the value in cash and in shares held by a subject at each point in time (CPV = cash + [shares 3 fundamental value at time t]). A correction for temporal autocorrelation in the data (AR 1 + white noise) was applied. Finally, six motion parameters were included in the GLM. In order to ﬁnd an interaction of the increased value representation due to the bubble manipulation, we contrasted linear increase to CPV in the bubble markets versus the nonbubble markets. To test the role of ToM in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, we extracted activity from an 8 mm sphere region of interest (ROI) centered in dmPFC [9, 50, 28] isolated in the whole brain SPM analysis. We then tested how activity that parametrically tracked the increase in CPV correlated with individual ToM scores during bubble markets and nonbubble markets, calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient between the parameter estimates in dmPFC and ToM scores. For the analysis using the PID, we calculated this metric (as described in the Results) for each time point in the original markets used as stimuli for the fMRI study. We then averaged the PID over the period of movie observed by each participant and used this parameter in a new GLM. We then contrasted this parametric regressor in the bubble markets versus the nonbubble markets and extract activity of two ROIs of 8 mm sphere centered in dmPFC [9, 50, 28] and vmPFC [3, 53,  2].  Behavioral Analyses Behavioral analyses were performed using Matlab statistical toolbook and SPSS. Ordered logistic regression was implemented using the PLUM (polytomous universal model) procedure in SPSS (DeCarlo, 2003). The dependent  fMRI-PPI Analysis To assess changes in connectivity between dmPFC and vmPFC as a function interaction (PPI) of the market type, we carried out a psychophysiological  Neuron 79, 1222–1231, September 18, 2013 ª2013 The Authors 1229  Theory of Mind Biases Values in Financial Bubbles  Neuron  Figure 6.

PPI is a measure of context-dependent connectivity, explaining the regional activity of other brain regions (here vmPFC) in terms of the interaction between responses in a seed region (here dmPFC) and a cognitive or sensory process. We carried out PPI analysis using the generalized PPI toolbox for SPM (gPPI; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/gppi). gPPI creates a new GLM in which the deconvolved activity of the seed region (8 mm sphere centered in dmPFC [9, 50, 28]) is assigned to the regressors modeling the effect of the task at the time of the trading periods and reconvolved with the hemodynamic response function. Average time courses were extracted from all voxels within an 8 mm sphere surrounding the vmPFC peak coordinate [3, 53,  2] that we isolated in the original SPM analysis. This was done since the aim of this analysis was to demonstrate that the activity we isolated in dmPFC and vmPFC (in the main SPM contrast) showed a functional connectivity. The main effects of the task, seed region time course, and motion parameters were included as regressors of no interest. The PPI contrast compares bubble markets (+1) with nonbubble markets ( 1).  Statistical Inference Second-level group contrasts from our GLM were calculated as a one-sample t test against zero for each ﬁrst-level linear contrast. Activations were reported as signiﬁcant if they survived familywise error correction (FWE) for multiple comparisons across a volume of 8 mm (SVC) cantered on peak of activity isolated in independent studies. For vmPFC, we used the coordinates [0, 53, 4] taken from (Suzuki et al., 2012); for dmPFC, we used the coordinates [ 3, 51, 24] taken from (Hampton et al., 2008).

Novel treatments are needed, in combination with markers to characterize and predict treatment response. Here, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to identify predictors and correlates of response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) at 10 Hz for eating disorders with refractory binge/purge symptomatology. Methods: 28 subjects with anorexia nervosa, binge−purge subtype or bulimia nervosa underwent 20–30 sessions of 10 Hz dmPFC rTMS. rs-fMRI data were collected before and after rTMS. Subjects were stratiﬁed into responder and nonresponder groups using a criterion of ≥50% reduction in weekly binge/purge frequency. Neural predictors and correlates of response were identiﬁed using seed-based functional connectivity (FC), using the dmPFC and adjacent dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as regions of interest. Results: 16 of 28 subjects met response criteria. Treatment responders had lower baseline FC from dmPFC to lateral orbitofrontal cortex and right posterior insula, and from dACC to right posterior insula and hippocampus. Responders had low baseline FC from the dACC to the ventral striatum and anterior insula; this connectivity increased over treatment. However, in nonresponders, frontostriatal FC was high at baseline, and dmPFC-rTMS suppressed FC in association with symptomatic worsening. Conclusions: Enhanced frontostriatal connectivity was associated with responders to dmPFC-rTMS for binge/purge behavior. rTMS caused paradoxical suppression of frontostriatal connectivity in nonresponders. rs-fMRI could prove critical for optimizing stimulation parameters in a future sham-controlled trial of rTMS in disordered eating.  © 2015 The Authors.

Introduction  Recurrent episodes of binge eating and purging behavior occur in both anorexia nervosa, binge−purge subtype (AN−BP) and bulimia nervosa (BN). In women, the lifetime prevalence of AN and BN is 0.9% and 1.5% respectively (Hudson et al., 2007). Eating disorders, in particular AN, have among the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric disorders (Sullivan, 1995), and treatment options are limited for severe forms of AN and BN, particularly for AN−BP (Arcelus et al., 2011).

New treatment options are urgently needed.  Therapeutic brain stimulation is a novel approach in treatmentrefractory eating disorders (ED), as recently demonstrated in a pilot study using deep brain stimulation (DBS) in AN (Lipsman et al., 2013). Non-invasive techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) would offer greater accessibility and lower medical risk than DBS, if suitable stimulation targets could be identiﬁed. Neuroimaging research has identiﬁed a variety of neuroanatomical substrates of ED pathophysiology. For example, on structural imaging, ED patients show reductions in gray matter volume in regions involved in reward,  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2015.06.008 2213-1582/© 2015 The Authors.

Dunlop et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 8 (2015) 611–618  impulse control, and emotion regulation: the caudate nucleus, ventral striatum (VS), anterior cingulate (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (Friederich et al., 2012; Schäfer et al., 2010; Titova et al., 2013; Van den Eynde et al., 2012). Likewise, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in ED reveal abnormal patterns of resting-state connectivity in the default-mode network (Cowdrey et al., 2014) and other intrinsic brain networks incorporating the ACC and insula (Amianto et al., 2013). ED patients also show abnormal VS activation in response to rewarding and aversive stimuli (Wagner et al., 2010, 2007). Patients with BN show hyperactivity in medial frontal lobe regions during inhibition of prepotent actions (Lock et al., 2011), and hypoactivity in response to food cues (Joos et al., 2011).  Among the various neural substrates implicated in ED pathology, a target of particular interest that is accessible to rTMS is the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). The dmPFC plays an important role in forms of self-control, including self-inhibition of movements (Brass and Haggard, 2007), self-cessation of loss-chasing in pathological gamblers (Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2008), self-suppression of emotional responses (Kühn et al., 2011), and impulse control (Cho et al., 2013). Likewise, non-invasive stimulation of medial prefrontal areas, via rTMS, enhances inhibitory control over prepotent responses (Obeso et al., 2013), improves subjective choice for delayed rewards in a delayed discounting task, and interferes with striatal dopamine (Cho et al., 2015). In sum, stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex using rTMS may alter the top-down executive control of the dmPFC to striatal regions associated with the urge to binge and purge, thereby improving symptom severity.  Considering this literature on the role for the DMPFC in selfregulation, one potential implication is that DMPFC-rTMS might be worth exploring as a therapeutic approach for addressing selfregulatory deﬁcits in ED. To date, most previous rTMS studies in ED have focused on the conventional target, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Although dlPFC-rTMS reduces cue-induced food craving in BN (Uher et al., 2005; Van den Eynde et al., 2010), a double-blind trial of dlPFC-rTMS for binge−purge symptoms found no signiﬁcant improvement over sham (Walpoth et al., 2008).  There are few reported studies of dmPFC-targeted rTMS to date. However, we recently investigated dmPFC-rTMS in major depression (MDD), ﬁnding efﬁcacy rates comparable to dlPFC-rTMS, but with sharply dichotomous outcomes of improvement (Downar et al., 2014). Using restingstate functional MRI (rsfMRI), we found that low dmPFC–subcortical connectivity predicted successful outcome, and that symptomatic improvements were associated with increased dmPFC connectivity. We also reported the serendipitous ﬁnding of full remission from binge− purge symptoms during dmPFC-rTMS for comorbid depression, in a patient with treatment-refractory BN (Downar et al., 2012). These observations suggested that dmPFC-rTMS might treat a subset of BN patients, and that enhanced frontal−subcortical connectivity on rsfMRI might accompany symptomatic improvement.  Here we used rsfMRI to identify patterns of functional connectivity associated with response to dmPFC-rTMS, delivered as an intervention-probe to a series of 28 ED patients with treatmentrefractory binge and purge behaviors. Based on our previous ﬁndings, we formulated two hypotheses: ﬁrst, that lower baseline dmPFC connectivity on rsfMRI would predict successful treatment; second, that successful treatment would be associated with increases in connectivity through a fronto-subcortical circuit incorporating the dmPFC.  2. Methods  2.1. Subjects  and lower than normal weight. BMI ranged from 14.5–28.8. AN−BP participants displayed both bingeing and purging behaviors. While there are certainly important differences in the clinical features of these disorders (e.g., failure to maintain normal body weight, or the presence of restricting symptoms), binge and purge behaviors were the speciﬁc target symptom for the purposes of this pilot study. Subjects engaged in ≥2 cumulative objective binge/purge episodes weekly at baseline to be included in the study. Diagnoses were established through interviews with 2 independent, Canadian Royal Collegecertiﬁed psychiatrists (authors JD, PG, PC, BW). In recognition of the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in this population, and in order to characterize rather than minimizing sample heterogeneity, common comorbidities were not excluded This inclusion of comorbidities is in line with our previous work in MDD (Downar et al., 2014). Comorbid diagnoses included MDD (n = 16), obsessive–compulsive disorder (n = 6), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 8), and bipolar disorder (n = 6). Patients with a history of a psychotic disorder, neurological disorder, active substance abuse, or contraindications to MRI or rTMS were excluded. All subjects had no improvements in bingeing/ purging to or were unable to tolerate at least 1 previous medication trial (n = 27), and had also not responded to previous inpatient/outpatient treatment courses in terms of an improvement of binges and purges (n = 25). On average, patients had not respond to 2.61 ± 2.44 inpatient/outpatient treatments, and 3.00 ± 2.37 medication trials. Current medications included SSRIs (n = 11), antipsychotics (n = 11), benzodiazepines (n = 8), trazodone (n = 5), and SNRIs (n = 3). As routinely stipulated (Salomons et al., 2014), subjects were required to refrain from any medication changes during and for ≥4 weeks before rTMS.  2.2. Clinical outcomes  The clinical outcome of interest, weekly frequency of binge and purge episodes, was monitored via a structured clinical interview, the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), administered 1 week before treatment, at each week during treatment, and at 4 weeks post-treatment. For the purposes of stratiﬁcation, response was deﬁned as ≥50% decrease in objective binge (N1000 calories per binge) and purge episode frequency from prerTMS to 4 weeks post-rTMS (at follow-up). Pre-treatment EDE assessments acquired binge/purge frequency for the 4 weeks prior to treatment, and the post-treatment EDE acquired frequency for the 4 weeks following treatment, and so the pre- and post-treatment scores were obtained from weeks outside of the rTMS treatment sessions. Data on bingeing and purging frequencies derived from the EDE was divided by 4 to generate a weekly frequency for bingeing and purging. To obtain weekly scores, EDE frequencies (which measure severity over 4 weeks) were divided over the 4 weeks. Although a more conservative criterion is sometimes used in clinical efﬁcacy studies, our primary aim was to characterize and distinguish the neural activity of subpopulations of patients showing improvement versus non-improvement in this population. A set of clinical and psychometric data, including the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HamD17), Beck Depression Index-II (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Index (BAI) were also collected as secondary metrics. To assess the distribution of outcomes across the study sample, we employed kernel density estimation by applying the Epanechnikov kernel (Epanechnikov, 1969) in Stata13 (StataCorp). Two-tailed t-tests (Bonferroni-adjusted) were performed to determine the signiﬁcance of differences in clinical measures between groups and between timepoints. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test was performed for comparisons of binge and purge frequency do to the markedly non-normal distribution of these data.  28 subjects (26 female, age range = 20 − 56 years, mean = 31.0 ± 9.5 years) meeting DSM-5 criteria for AN−BP (n = 11), BN (n = 17) participated in this proof-of-concept, open-label study. Subjects included individuals with bingeing and purging behavior, both at a normal  2.3. Neuroimaging acquisition  The neuroimaging protocol followed parameters reported in detail in our previous studies of rsfMRI with dmPFC-rTMS (Downar et al.,  K. Dunlop et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 8 (2015) 611–618  613  2014; Salomons et al., 2014). All subjects underwent 3 T MRI the week prior to and the week after rTMS, with a T1-weighted (TE = 12 ms, TI = 300 ms, ﬂip-angle = 20°, 0.94 × 0.94 × 1.5 mm voxels) and a 10-min eyes-open resting state functional MRI scan (TE = 30 ms, TR = 2000 ms, ﬂip-angle = 85°, 3.4 × 3.4 × 5 mm voxels).  2.4. Neuronavigation and rTMS treatment  Neuronavigation and rTMS treatment followed our previously reported protocols for dmPFC-rTMS in MDD (Downar et al., 2014; Salomons et al., 2014). Neuronavigation employed the Visor 2.0 system (Advanced Neuro Technologies, Enschede, Netherlands) to target the stereotaxic coordinate (X = 0, Y = +30, Z = +30) in Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). rTMS employed the MagPro-R30 system (MagVenture, Farum, Denmark) and a Cool-DB80 coil. Motor thresholds were determined via contractions of the extensor hallucis longus (Hayward et al., 2007). Stimulation of the dmPFC was delivered at 120% resting motor threshold, at 10 Hz, 5 s on, 10 s off, 3000 pulses/ hemisphere, with left then right lateralized coil orientation (Terao et al., 2001). Unilateral stimulation was achieved by orienting the coil vertex at the stereotactic target laterally, with current ﬂow oriented towards the desired hemisphere (Harmer et al., 2001). If a patient missed an rTMS session for logistical reasons, an additional session was added at the end of the course of treatment (no patient required more than 4 such sessions). Patients underwent 20 sessions of dmPFC-rTMS on weekdays; responders with any residual binge/purge symptoms were extended to 30 sessions (mean = 21.2 ± 3.7 sessions, range = 18–30).  2.5. MRI preprocessing, seed selection and statistical analysis  Preprocessing of resting-state fMRI data from patients employed FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2012), following methods as reported in our previous dmPFC-rTMS studies (Salomons et al., 2014) for slice-timing correction, segmentation, motion correction, spatial smoothing (6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel), correction for white matter and cerebrospinal ﬂuid signal artifacts, bandpass ﬁltering (0.009–0.09 Hz), and linear coregistration to the MNI-152 template.  Seed regions-of-interest (ROIs) were deﬁned a priori from the parcellation atlas of Craddock et al. (2012) for the dmPFC and adjacent dorsal ACC (dACC) based on proximity to the stimulation target, following our analyses in a previous study of dmPFC-rTMS in MDD (Salomons et al., 2014). The seeds are described in detail in that study; their centroids were MNI = −4, 44, 42 for dmPFC and MNI = 0, 38, 24 for dACC (see Figs. 2 and 3 for images of the ROIs). For ﬁrst-level analysis, each seed ROI was co-registered to each subject3s brain via nonlinear transformation, then applied as masks to extract the mean ROI time series. These time series were used to generate whole-brain maps of positively and negatively correlated voxels with the seed ROI before and after treatment, via a linear regression analysis using a ﬁxed effects model at the individual-subject level.  Group level analysis was performed using FSL3s FLAME mixed effects model (Beckmann et al., 2003). We ﬁrst identiﬁed regions where the degree of correlation at baseline to the ROIs differed signiﬁcantly between responders and non-responders. To assess whether differing changes in resting-state connectivity over treatment would be associated with different outcomes, we then compared pre- and post-treatment scans to identify regions where the pre- to post-treatment change in correlation to the seed ROIs differed signiﬁcantly between responders and non-responders. The results of these analyses were transformed into z-score maps, correcting for multiple comparisons using a Gaussian random ﬁeld theory cluster-based correction (z-score N 1.96, cluster signiﬁcance p N 0.05, corrected). Finally, the clusters previously obtained from group-level baseline predictor and change analyses were coregistered to patients3 individual scans, and connectivity values were extracted for each subject.  3. Results  3.1. Primary clinical outcomes  No serious or treatment-limiting adverse effects occurred, and subjects reported only the localized scalp discomfort and transient headache routinely associated with rTMS treatment sessions.  Baseline binge and purge episode frequency per week was 11.1 ± SD 18.6 and 17.6 ± SD 31.7 (Table 1). Combining both subpopulations, there was no signiﬁcant overall change in binge frequency (post-rTMS mean = 8.6 ± 2.9, mean percent improvement = 20.4 ± 77.0, Wilcoxon signed-rank W27 = 1.29, p = 0.20) but a signiﬁcant decrease in purge frequency was found (post-rTMS mean = 20.33 ± 10.2, mean percent improvement = 35.7 ± 62.1, Wilcoxon signed-rank W27 = 2.20, p = 0.03). 16 of 28 subjects achieved ≥50% reduction in binge and purge frequency from baseline to follow-up. However, outcomes were widely divergent across individuals, ranging from full remission to marked worsening of symptoms (Fig. 1). The degree of improvement across individuals followed a non-normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk W27 = 0.85, p = 0.001). For this reason, subsequent analyses were performed to characterize responder and non-responder subpopulations separately.  Among responders, symptom frequency improved from 7.5 ± SD 5.4–1.4 ± SD 1.9 binge episodes/week (Wilcoxon signed-rank W15 = 3.39, p = 0.0007) and from 8.7 ± SD 6.9–1.3 ± SD 2.0 purge episodes/week (W15 = 3.49, p = 0.0005). Among non-responders, symptom frequency before and after treatment showed a nonsigniﬁcant worsening from 20.5 ± SD 26.8–18.3 ± SD 19.41 binge episodes/ week (W11 = −1.30, p = 0.20) and 36.7 ± SD 44.3–54.5 ± SD 76.9 purge episodes/week (W11 = −0.59, p = 0.55). There was no signiﬁcant difference between responders and non-responders at baseline for either binge (Mann–Whitney U26 = 0.91, p = 0.36) or purge (U26 = 1.21, p = 0.23) frequency. Further results pertaining to global and subscale changes on the EDE are reported in our supplementary document.  3.2. Psychometric outcomes  We also assessed the relationships between the following pretreatment clinical measures and binge/purge percent improvement: baseline BMI, illness duration, baseline binge/purge severity, age, ED diagnosis (AN−BP or BN), presence of co-morbidity (MDD, obsessive– compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder), current medication (benzodiazepine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, antipsychotic), and baseline severity and percent improvement  Fig. 1.

Pre-treatment functional connectivity from dmPFC to left and right lateral OFC was slightly positive in responders (z = 1.12 ± 0.56), and positive in both non-responders (z = 4.75 ± 0.56). Parameter estimates also revealed that pre-treatment functional connectivity from dmPFC to right insula was negative in responders (z = −3.36 ± 0.39) and non-responders (z = −0.20 ± 0.73) (Fig. 2B).

Compared to non-responders, responders underwent signiﬁcantly greater increases in functional connectivity between the dACC and bilateral caudate nucleus and VS, anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus and adjacent OFC, and right putamen (Table 3, Fig. 3A). Responders also showed greater increases in functional connectivity between the dmPFC and right middle temporal gyrus, and greater decreases in functional connectivity between the dmPFC and bilateral thalamus (Table 3).  Inspection of parameter estimates revealed marked differences between responders and non-responders in how dACC–VS functional connectivity changed following treatment (Fig. 3B). The responder group showed lower functional connectivity between the dACC and VS prior to treatment, increasing signiﬁcantly following successful treatment (t12 = 2.37, p = 0.035). Conversely, connectivity in nonresponders decreased signiﬁcantly (t8 = 2.316, p = 0.05), becoming signiﬁcantly lower than treatment responders post-treatment (t20 = 2.409, p = 0.03). A similar pattern of signiﬁcant increases in functional connectivity in responders (t12 = 3.314, p = 0.006), but decreases in functional connectivity in non-responders, trending to signiﬁcance (t8 = 2.078, p = 0.07), was observed between the dACC and left anterior insula over the course of treatment (Fig. 3B).

Discussion  To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of neuroimaging ﬁndings in ED patients undergoing non-invasive brain stimulation. As an intervention-probe, dmPFC-rTMS divided patients into treatmentresponsive and nonresponsive groups, with widespread differences in resting-state connectivity apparent between these groups at baseline. rTMS-responsive patients showed baseline hypoconnectivity from the stimulation target to other cortical and subcortical regions, relative to non-responders. frontostriatal connectivity was enhanced following dmPFC-rTMS, in association with improvement in binge and purge frequency. Conversely, in patients with higher baseline connectivity, the same intervention produced the opposite effect, reducing frontostriatal connectivity, in association with nonimprovement or worsening of symptoms.  In responders,  Of particular interest were the divergent trajectories of outcome across individuals. While many subjects showed marked improvement, a large proportion of subjects did not improve, or even showed deterioration, when exposed to the same intervention. The observation of divergent responses to dmPFC-rTMS in ED is in keeping with our previous report of a sharply bimodal distribution of responses to dmPFC-rTMS in MDD (Downar et al., 2014). Of note, similarly dichotomous trajectories of improvement have been identiﬁed in clinical trials of duloxetine (Gueorguieva et al., 2011) and escitalopram (Thase et al., 2011).  The possibility of a neurobiological basis for the responder–nonresponder dichotomy in the present study is supported by differences in resting-state functional connectivity observed between the two groups before treatment. In keeping with our ﬁrst hypothesis, responders had signiﬁcantly lower functional connectivity from the dmPFC and adjacent dACC to subcortical and cortical areas involved in emotion generation and regulation: hippocampus, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and insula. These ﬁndings are consistent with several previous studies in MDD patients, linking baseline resting-state hypoconnectivity to better rTMS response (Fox et al., 2013, 2012; Liston et al., 2014; Salomons et al., 2014).  Another key ﬁnding in the present study is that the same 10 Hz intervention had widely divergent effects on functional connectivity across individuals: patients with high baseline cortico-cortical and fronto-insular connectivity saw signiﬁcant reductions after 10 Hz rTMS, while patients with low baseline frontostriatal and frontoinsular connectivity saw signiﬁcant increases after stimulation at the same frequency. This phenomenon is unlikely to represent a regression to the mean, as the groups showed divergence rather than convergence in both symptomatology and functional connectivity over treatment. The results are also consistent with our previously reported observations of markedly dichotomous effects on striatal, thalamic and cortical functional connectivity from 10 Hz dmPFC-rTMS in patients with MDD (Salomons et al., 2014). The results are also consistent with previous studies of dlPFC-rTMS in depression: while some improved with highfrequency rTMS, others worsened on this regimen, and instead responded better to low-frequency stimulation of the same target (Kimbrell et al., 1999; Speer et al., 2009, 2000). These ﬁndings are consistent with mounting evidence that the physiological effects of a given rTMS protocol can vary widely across individuals, not just in magnitude but also in direction (Cárdenas-Morales et al., 2014; Eldaief et al., 2011; Hallett, 2007; Maeda et al., 2000).  One limitation of this preliminary study involves its relatively small sample size. Though the sample was slightly larger than those used in several recent rTMS-fMRI studies in more prevalent disorders such as MDD (Baeken et al., 2014; Liston et al., 2014; Salomons et al., 2014),  the present study does not allow a more detailed characterization of potentially important clinical markers that could help distinguish treatment subpopulations. Although the present investigation did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant pre-treatment differences between responders and non-responders in terms of duration of illness, BMI, and binge/ purge frequency, future studies with higher power will be necessary to better assess whether those with more severe illness in general are less likely to respond to treatment. Another caveat relates to the inclusion of multiple DSM-5 diagnostic categories in the current sample, which embraced ED patients with binge−purge behaviors alongside common comorbidities. On this point, we note that the sample composition was chosen to be representative of clinical populations presenting with refractory binge−purge symptoms, and that no DSM-5 diagnosis signiﬁcantly correlated with rTMS response. More generally, it is unclear that current categorical nosologies map particularly well on to rTMS responsiveness in general; the distinction between unipolar and bipolar depression had no bearing on outcome in a recent metaanalysis of rTMS efﬁcacy (Berlim et al., 2014). We aware that some of our subjects were underweight, and that improvements in bingeing and purging represent a limited area of improvement for such individuals. However, given the exploratory nature of this trial, and the notorious difﬁculty in treatment individuals with ANBN, we felt it was important to include such individuals in the trial. It is clear that the question of whether dmPFC-rTMS aids other forms of disordered eating (including restrictive-type behaviors) is still an important area for future investigation.  Another potential criticism relates to the use of an open-label design without sham stimulation. Since no previous studies have examined dmPFC-rTMS in ED, and since the primary aim of the study was to apply an intervention-probe and characterize neural predictors and correlates of response (as in our recent work in depression), we opted for the present approach in order to identify sources of heterogeneity that might confound a future sham-controlled trial. The results suggest that three potentially critical confounds will need to be accommodated in future trials: ﬁrst, the presence of distinct neural endophenotypes, not readily apparent on standard diagnostic criteria, but with differential responses to the intervention at both the neural and the clinical level; second, the need to tailor rTMS parameters to the individual patient in order to avoid paradoxical effects; third, whether predictors of improvement relate to illness mechanism, or a capacity to change with rTMS treatment, or both. Our results suggest that rsfMRI techniques help address both of these issues in any future randomized controlled study of rTMS in ED.  In conclusion, dmPFC-rTMS shows promising therapeutic effects in a subset of ED patients with refractory binge and purge behaviors. As in MDD, therapeutic effects are associated with increases in initially low levels of fronto-striatal functional connectivity, detectable on pretreatment rsfMRI. However, a signiﬁcant proportion of patients have initially higher baseline fronto-striatal connectivity, and in these patients, the same intervention produces paradoxical decreases in frontostriatal connectivity after treatment, alongside non-response or worsening of clinical symptoms. A randomized controlled trial of dmPFC-rTMS in ED would be a reasonable next step. However, the results of this study join a growing body of evidence (Fox et al., 2013), suggesting that future trials of rTMS will need to take into account both the heterogeneity of individual patients3 neural activity, and the heterogeneity of effects ensuing from the stimulation itself. Pretreatment neuroimaging may eventually play a crucial role in optimizing stimulation parameters, to maximize the chances of success in each patient presenting for treatment.

Across age, gender, religion and ethnicity, people’s judgments on classic dilemmas are sensitive to the same moral principles. In many cases, moral judgments depend not only on the outcome of the action, but on the agent’s beliefs and intentions at the time of action. For example, we blame agents who attempt but fail to harm others, while generally forgiving agents who harm others accidentally and unknowingly. Nevertheless, as we report here, there are individual differences in the extent to which observers exculpate agents for accidental harms. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the extent to which innocent intentions are taken to mitigate blame for accidental harms is correlated with activation in a speciﬁc brain region during moral judgment. This brain region, the right temporo-parietal junction, has been previously implicated in reasoning about other people’s thoughts, beliefs, and intentions in moral and non-moral contexts.  © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction  Classic moral dilemmas often require an observer to judge whether it is permissible to harm one innocent person to save many. For example, is it permissible to push a man off a bridge so that his body will stop a trolley from running over ﬁve other people? Competition between emotional aversion to committing harm (e.g., pushing the man), and abstract reasoning, in this case, utilitarian reasoning about maximizing aggregate welfare (e.g., ﬁve lives are worth more than one), gives rise to the ‘dilemma’, and to characteristic neural response proﬁles (Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen, 2001; Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, & Cohen, 2004). These results have led to two-process theories of moral judgment (Cushman, Young, & Hauser, 2006; Greene et al., 2004; Haidt, 2001; Hsu, Anen, & Quartz, 2008). Implicit, automatic processes lead observers to reject emotionally aversive harms. Explicit, controlled processes support abstract reasoning and cognitive control.  夽 This study was carried out at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ∗ Corresponding author at: Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Building 46, Room 4021, 43 Vassar Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.03.020  Here, we extend two-process theories by considering a third factor upon which many moral judgments depend: the agent’s mental state. When we evaluate an action, be it killing one or letting many die, harming or helping, breaking the law, breaking a promise, or breaking fast with the wrong sorts of people, we consider the agent’s mental state at the time of her action. Did she know what she was doing? Did she act intentionally or accidentally? Observers judge intentional harms as worse than accidental harms (e.g., Cushman, 2008). Observers are even sensitive to more subtle mental state distinctions, judging harms intended as necessary means to an end to be worse than harms that are merely foreseen as side-effects of one’s action (Borg, Hynes, Van Horn, Grafton, & Sinnott-Armstrong, 2006; Cushman et al., 2006; Hauser, Cushman, Young, Jin, & Mikhail, 2007; Mikhail, 2007).  Observers differ in the degree to which they take mental states into account for moral judgments. For example, children 5 years old and younger rely primarily on the action’s observable outcomes (Hebble, 1971; Piaget, 1965/1932; Shultz, Wright, & Schleifer, 1986; Yuill, 1984; Yuill & Perner, 1988; Zelazo, Helwig, & Lau, 1996). Children are particularly unlikely to mitigate blame for accidental harms, and even judge accidental harms to be worse than failed attempts to harm (e.g., Baird & Astington, 2004). Not until they are 6 or 7 years old do children begin to make moral judgments that depend substantially on beliefs (Baird & Astington, 2004; Baird & Moses, 2001; Darley & Zanna, 1982; Fincham & Jaspers, 1979;  2066  L. Young, R. Saxe / Neuropsychologia 47 (2009) 2065–2072  Karniol, 1978; Shultz et al., 1986; Yuill, 1984) and integrate the distinct outcome and mental state features of actions (Grueneich, 1982; Weiner, 1995; Zelazo et al., 1996). There is also evidence that even adult observers differ in the extent to which they exculpate an agent for accidentally causing harm, and the extent to which they appeal to mental state factors in doing so (e.g., Cohen & Rozin, 2001; Nichols & Ulatowski, 2007).  In the current study, we investigated the neural correlates of individual differences in moral judgments that depend on agents’ beliefs about whether or not they will cause harm. Consider a case in which an agent mistakes some poisonous white substance for sugar and, as a result, accidentally makes her friend sick by putting the poisonous substance in her coffee. Here, the agent believes falsely that her action will be harmless, and it is her false belief leads her to cause harm in spite of innocent intentions. Nevertheless, observers may disagree about the amount of blame that she deserves. Young children, and even some adults, may consider the agent very morally blameworthy for making her friend sick, in spite of her innocent intentions.  The neural mechanisms for reasoning about beliefs (or, more generally, mental states) have been investigated in a series of recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. These studies reveal a consistent group of brain regions for mental state reasoning in non-moral contexts: the medial prefrontal cortex, right and left temporo-parietal junction, and precuneus (Ciaramidaro et al., 2007; Fletcher et al., 1995; Gallagher et al., 2000; Gobbini, Koralek, Bryan, Montgomery, & Haxby, 2007; Ruby & Decety, 2003; Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003; Vogeley et al., 2001). Of these regions, the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ) in particular appears to be selective for belief attribution (Aichorn, Perner, Kronbichler, Staffen, & Ladurner, 2005; Fletcher et al., 1995; Gallagher et al., 2000; Gobbini et al., 2007; Perner, Aichorn, Khronblicher, Staffen, & Ladurner, 2006; Saxe & Wexler, 2005). For example, the response in the RTPJ is high when subjects read stories about a character’s thoughts, beliefs, knowledge but low during stories containing other socially relevant information, for example, a character’s physical or cultural traits, or even internal sensations such as hunger (Saxe & Powell, 2006).  Recently, we have also investigated the neural basis of belief reasoning in moral contexts (Young, Cushman, Hauser, & Saxe, 2007; Young & Saxe, 2008; Young & Saxe, in press). While in the scanner, participants read stories about a protagonist, and made moral judgments about the protagonist’s actions. During the story, participants read two kinds of morally relevant information: (1) the protagonist’s belief (e.g., that the powder was sugar) and (2) the reality (e.g., that the powder was poison). We investigated the neural response while participants initially processed these pieces of information. We found that the response in the RTPJ and precuneus was higher while participants read about beliefs than about other facts, independent of the order in which belief and non-belief facts were presented (Young & Saxe, 2008). However, this initial encoding response did not distinguish between negative and neutral beliefs (e.g., that the powder was poison versus sugar), between true and false beliefs, or between negative and neutral outcomes. In the current paper, we investigated a different question: namely, which brain region’s response predicts people’s use of belief information during the moral judgment itself?  We predicted that participants’ use of belief information to make moral judgments would be correlated with the recruitment of speciﬁc brain regions associated with mental state reasoning. More speciﬁcally, we predicted that higher activation in these brain regions would lead to less blame (or more exculpation) for accidental harm, and more blame for attempted harm. Given prior evidence for its selectivity, we speciﬁcally predicted that these patterns would be observed in the RTPJ.  2. Methods  Fifteen right-handed neurologically normally adults (aged 18–22 years, 8 women, 7 men) participated in the study for payment. All participants were native English speakers, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and gave written informed consent in accordance with the requirements of Internal Review Board at MIT. Participants were scanned at 3T (at the MIT scanning facility in Cambridge, MA) using twenty-six 4-mm-thick near-axial slices covering the whole brain. Standard echoplanar imaging procedures were used (TR = 2 s, TE = 40 ms, ﬂip angle 90◦). The experiment followed a 2× 2 design. Stimuli consisted of 4 variations (conditions) of 24 moral scenarios (Fig. 1, see Supplementary Material for full text of all scenarios):  Fig. 1. Experimental stimuli and design. “Foreshadow” information foreshadows whether the action will result in a negative or neutral outcome. “Belief” information states whether the protagonist holds a belief that she is in a negative situation and that action will result in a negative outcome (“negative” belief) or a belief that she is a neutral situation and that action will result in a neutral outcome (“neutral” belief). Sentences corresponding to each category were presented in 6 s blocks. “Judgment” was presented alone on the screen for 4 s.  L. Young, R. Saxe / Neuropsychologia 47 (2009) 2065–2072  2067  (i) Protagonists either harmed another person (negative outcome) or did no harm  (neutral outcome).  (ii) Protagonists either believed that they were causing harm (“negative” belief) or  believed they were causing no harm (“neutral” belief).  Each possible belief was true for one outcome and false for the other outcome; the agent held true beliefs in the no harm and intentional harm conditions and false beliefs in the accidental harm and attempted harm conditions. Word count was matched across conditions (mean± S.D. for the all-neutral condition: 103± 10; accidental harm: 101± 9; attempted harm: 103± 10; intentional harm: 103± 9). On average, scenarios featuring negative beliefs contained the same number of words as scenarios featuring neutral beliefs (F(1, 23) = 0.15 p = 0.70, partial h2 = 0.006); scenarios featuring negative outcomes contained the same number of words as scenarios featuring neutral outcomes (F(1, 23) = 0.17 p = 0.68, partial h2 = 0.007).  Stories were presented in four cumulative segments (previous segments remained on the screen when later segments were added): (1) background information to set the scene (0–6 s), (2) facts foreshadowing the eventual outcome (6–12 s), (3) the protagonist’s belief (12–18 s), (4) the protagonist’s action and its outcome (18–26 s). All of the story text was then removed from the screen, and replaced with the question and response scale. Subjects had 4 s (while the question was on the screen) to judge how much moral blame the protagonist deserved for performing a particular action on a 4-point scale (1: none, 4: a lot), using a button press. Subjects saw one version of each scenario. Stories were presented in a pseudorandom order; conditions were counterbalanced across runs and subjects. Fixation blocks (14 s) were interleaved between stories.  In the same scan session, subjects participated in four runs of a theory of mind (mental state reasoning) localizer experiment, contrasting stories requiring inferences about mental states (e.g., thoughts, beliefs) versus physical representations (e.g., outdated photographs, maps, signs; Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003).  3. FMRI analysis  MRI data were analyzed using SPM2 (http://www.ﬁl.ion. ucl.ac.uk/spm) and custom software. Each subject’s data were motion corrected and normalized onto a common brain space (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI, template). Data were smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁlter (full width half maximum = 5 mm) and high-pass ﬁltered during analysis. A slow event-related design was used and modeled using a boxcar regressor to estimate the hemodynamic response for each condition. An event was deﬁned as a single story, the event onset deﬁned by the onset of text on screen.  Both whole-brain and tailored regions of interest (ROI) analyses were conducted. Six ROIs were deﬁned for each subject individually based on a whole brain analysis of the independent localizer experiment, and deﬁned as contiguous voxels that were signiﬁcantly more active (p < 0.001, uncorrected, k > 20) while the subject read the mental state stories, as compared with the physical representation stories. All peak voxels are reported in MNI coordinates.  The responses of these ROIs were then measured while subjects read the moral stories from the current study. Within the ROI, the average percent signal change (PSC) relative to rest baseline (PSC = 100× raw BOLD magnitude for (condition− ﬁxation)/raw BOLD magnitude for ﬁxation) was calculated for each condition at each time point (averaging across all voxels in the ROI and all blocks of the same condition). We then averaged together the time points within the judgment phase (30–34 s after story onset, to account for hemodynamic lag) to get a single PSC value for each region in each subject (Poldrack, 2006). This value was used in all analyses reported below.  Fig. 2. Functional localizer results. Brain regions where the BOLD signal was higher for (nonmoral) stories about mental states than (nonmoral) stories about physical representations (N = 15, random effects analysis, p < 0.001, uncorrected, k > 20).

Protagonists causing harm were judged more blameworthy than those causing no harm (F(1, 14) = 38.3 p = 2.4× 10−5, partial h2 = 0.73). Protagonists with “negative” beliefs were judged more blameworthy than those with “neutral” beliefs (F(1, 14) = 1.2× 102 p = 3.9× 10−8, partial h2 = 0.90). We observed no belief by outcome interaction (F(1, 14) = 0.37 p = 0.55, partial h2 = 0.03).  There was no effect of gender on moral judgment, when gender was included in the analysis. Gender did not interact with either belief (F(1, 13) = 0.12 p = 0.73, partial h2 = 0.01) or outcome (F(1, 13) = 0.03 p = 0.87, partial h2 = 0.002) or the interaction of belief and outcome (F(1, 13) = 0.37 p = 0.53, partial h2 = 0.03).  4.2.2. Reaction time  Reaction time data were analyzed in the same fashion as the moral judgment data (Table 2). On average, judgments of protagonists causing negative outcomes were faster than judgments of protagonists causing neutral outcomes (F(1, 14) = 16.2 p = 0.001, partial h2 = 0.54). There was no difference in reaction time for neutral and negative beliefs (F(1, 14) = 3.0 p = 0.11, partial h2 = 0.18). We observed an interaction between belief and outcome (F(1, 14) = 5.4 p = 0.04 partial h2 = 0.28); speciﬁcally, reaction times were longer for neutral beliefs than for negative beliefs for negative outcomes, but no different for neutral and negative beliefs for neutral outcomes.  There was no effect of gender on reaction time, when gender was included in the analysis. Gender did not interact with belief (F(1, 13) = 0.55 p = 0.47, partial h2 = 0.04) or outcome (F(1, 13) = 0.002 p = .97, partial h2 < 0.001) or the interaction between belief and outcome (F(1, 13) = 0.35 p = 0.57, partial h2 = 0.03).  4.3. Moral judgment: fMRI results  For each of the four conditions, in each ROI, we calculated the correlation across participants between the average percent signal change (PSC) during the moral judgment (see analyses in Supplementary Material, Supplementary Fig. 1) and the value of the moral judgments (Fig. 3a and b).  The average PSC in the RTPJ during judgment of accidental harms was strongly and negatively correlated with the participant’s average judgment of those accidental harms (r =−0.66, p = 0.007; Fig. 3a, top panel). That is, participants with high RTPJ activation assigned less blame, and participants with low RTPJ activation assigned more blame, to the same agents for the same actions resulting in the same harmful outcomes. The correlation effect was speciﬁc to the condition of accidental harm. There was no correlation between RTPJ response and judgments in the other conditions (all-neutral: r =−0.38, p = 0.17; attempted harm: r = 0.19, p = 0.50; intentional harm: r =−0.30, p = 0.28). There was also no correlation between RTPJ response and reaction time (r =−0.32, p = 0.25).  The correlation between moral judgment of accidental harms and PSC was speciﬁc to the RTPJ and did not emerge for any other ROI (Table 3). In the LTPJ (Fig. 3a, middle panel), there was no signiﬁcant correlation between PSC and moral judgments in any condition (all |r| < 0.40; all p > 0.20). In the PC (Fig. 3a, bottom panel), there  was no signiﬁcant correlation between PSC and moral judgments in any condition (all |r| < 0.50; all p > 0.05). In the DMPFC (Fig. 3b, top panel), there was no signiﬁcant correlation between PSC and moral judgments in any condition (all |r| < 0.30; all p > 0.30). In the MMPFC (Fig. 3b, middle panel), there was no signiﬁcant correlation between PSC and moral judgments in any condition (all |r| < 0.60; all p > 0.10).  In the VMPFC (Fig. 3b, bottom panel), there was no correlation between PSC and moral judgments in the accidental harm (r =−0.49, p = 0.15), all-neutral (r = 0.26, p = 0.47), and intentional harm (r =−0.51, p = 0.13) conditions. There was, however, a weak positive correlation between PSC in the VMPFC and moral judgment of attempted harms (r = 0.64, p = 0.048). This correlation, however, would not survive a correction for multiple comparisons. There was no correlation between VMPFC response and reaction times (r =−0.24, p = 0.50) in this condition.  We also tested the signiﬁcance of the difference between the correlation between moral judgment of accidental harms and response in the RTPJ and the same correlation in the other ROIs, from the same samples (e.g., to test for the difference between the RTPJ and the DMPFC, we included only those subjects in whom we identiﬁed both RTPJ and DMPFC; Chen & Popovich, 2002). We found signiﬁcant differences between the RTPJ and the PC (t = 3.65, p < 0.005), LTPJ (t = 2.23, p < 0.025), and the DMPFC (t = 2.86, p < 0.01). The differences did not reach signiﬁcance for the MMPFC (t = 1.78, 0.05 < p < 0.10) or the VMPFC (t = 1.63, 0.05 < p < 0.10).  We also conducted whole brain random effects analyses of the moral judgment experiment, to identify voxels in which the BOLD response at the time of the judgment was signiﬁcantly correlated with the participant’s moral judgment (p < 0.001, uncorrected, k > 20), for accidental or attempted harm. No brain regions showed a signiﬁcant correlation with moral judgments in these analyses. These results are consistent with the higher power of functional ROI analyses to detect subtle but systematic response proﬁles (Saxe, Brett, & Kanwisher, 2006).  5. Discussion  FMRI ﬁndings have indicated that speciﬁc brain regions, including especially the RTPJ, support the ability to attribute beliefs to agents in both moral (e.g., Young et al., 2007; Young & Saxe, 2008; Young & Saxe, in press) and non-moral contexts (e.g., Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003; Perner et al., 2006). Behavioral studies have revealed that moral judgments depend signiﬁcantly on mental state attribution; judgments of moral blame in particular depend on both the mental state (e.g., belief) of the agent and the outcome of the action (Cushman, 2008). The current results integrate these ﬁndings, showing that as the response in the RTPJ increases, so does the inﬂuence of belief information on moral judgments. More speciﬁcally, the extent to which the RTPJ is recruited during moral judgment is variable across subjects, and individual differences in the RTPJ response are correlated with the extent to which subjects use belief information in moral exculpation: subjects with higher activation of the RTPJ are more likely to exculpate agents for causing harm accidentally on the basis of a false belief. The current behav 2070  L. Young, R. Saxe / Neuropsychologia 47 (2009) 2065–2072  ioral and neural results therefore reinforce and clarify the role of mental state reasoning in moral judgment. Exculpating an agent who causes harm accidentally – an especially difﬁcult task for young children – requires an especially robust mental state representation.  which they exculpated someone for an accident based on a false belief. Important questions for future research include whether these individual differences are stable across stimuli and experiments, and whether they extend to all domains of morality or are restricted to cases of bodily harm.  6. Moral universals and individual differences  Contemporary moral psychology often emphasizes the robustness of moral judgments to cultural and demographic differences: people are sensitive to the same moral principles independent of gender, age, ethnicity, and religion (e.g., O’Neill & Petrinovich, 1998; Petrinovich, O’Neill, & Jorgensen, 1993; Hauser et al., 2007). For example, the majority of subjects across cultures and demographic groups judge that it is permissible to turn a trolley away from ﬁve people and onto one person instead but impermissible to push a man off a footbridge so that his body stops a trolley from hitting ﬁve other people.  Nevertheless, there is evidence for systematic individual differences in moral judgment of these classic dilemmas. For example, the extent to which subjects engage in “cognitive” versus intuitive/emotional processes may inﬂuence judgments on “the trolley problem” (Greene et al., 2001, 2004). Individuals with higher working memory capacity are more likely to endorse utilitarian moral choices (Moore, Clark, & Kane, 2008), harming a few to save many. Individuals who score high in “need for cognition” (Cacioppo, Petty, & Kao, 1984) and low on “faith in intuition” (Epstein, Pacini, DenesRaj, & Heier, 1996) show the same pattern. Other research has shown that individual differences in “need for cognition” are related to individual differences in punitive attitudes, especially towards negligent or reckless behavior, such as drunk driving (Sargent, 2004). More speciﬁcally, individuals with a low “need for cognition” punish such behaviors more harshly, perhaps responding automatically to emotionally salient harmful outcomes; individuals with a high “need for cognition” respond more leniently, perhaps taking into account other factors such as situational or mental state factors and their interaction.  There is also some prior evidence of differences in the weight given speciﬁcally to mental states in moral judgment. One example is attitudes towards duty and obligation, when the agent’s mental state is at odds with the agent’s action. In one study of cultural differences (Cohen & Rozin, 2001), Jews were more likely to make outcome-based judgments, recognizing, for example, the value of taking care of one’s parents even in the absence of positive feelings towards them. Christians, in contrast, were more likely to make mental state-based judgments, judging that caring for one’s parents without appropriately positive mental states is hypocritical.  Related research has found individual differences in the sideeffect effect or the Knobe effect (for a review, see Knobe, 2005). Participants are told that the chairman of a company implements a program to gain proﬁt, but a side effect of that action, which he foresees but “doesn’t care” about, is that the environment will be harmed. On average, participants judge that the chairman intentionally harmed the environment. By contrast, if the side-effect is that the environment will be helped, participants judge that he did not intentionally help the environment. The correct interpretation of the side-effect effect remains controversial (e.g., Machery, 2008). For our purposes, though, the key point is that there are individual differences in such judgments of intentionality and moral blame; some participants focus mostly on the chairman’s desires, while others focus on what he believed or knew would happen (Nichols & Ulatowski, 2007).  In sum, a growing body of research suggests that there are individual differences in moral judgments, generally, and moral judgments based on beliefs, speciﬁcally. The current research ﬁts nicely with this trend. Adults in our study differed in the extent to  7. Accidents versus attempts  One open question concerning these results is: why was the response in the RTPJ correlated with the use of beliefs for moral judgments of accidental harms but not attempted harms? One possibility is that we simply had less power to detect the correlation in the attempted harm condition, because there was less variance across participants in moral judgments of attempted harms. An alternative, however, is that there are meaningful differences in the cognitive processes involved in using belief information to decrease, versus increase, moral blame. There are at least three ways in which belief information might be used differently in these two conditions: accidents and attempts.  First, moral judgments of accidents and attempts may depend on qualitatively different mental state attributions. Pilot behavioral data suggest that judgments of accidental harms depend mostly on what the protagonist thought or didn’t know; by contrast, judgments of attempted harms depend on what the protagonist desired or intended (e.g., if the agent believes the stuff to be poison and puts it in her friend’s coffee, she most likely wants to poison her friend). This distinction is consistent with the unexpected correlation we observed between judgments of attempted harms, and the BOLD response in the VMPFC. Prior neuroimaging and neuropsychological research studies (Greene et al., 2001; Koenigs et al., 2007; Mendez, Anderson, & Shapira, 2005; Ciaramelli, Muccioli, Ladavas, & di Pellegrino, 2007) suggest that the VMPFC supports the processing of social and moral emotions for moral judgment. For example, individuals with lesions to the VMPFC are less sensitive to differences in the emotional salience and intentional nature of actions, choosing to harm one to save many even when the harm is both emotionally aversive and intentional (Ciaramelli et al., 2007; Koenigs et al., 2007). We hypothesize that, in our experiment, the RTPJ was speciﬁcally recruited for reasoning about the protagonist’s thoughts and knowledge, whereas the VMPFC was involved in representing the protagonist’s emotionally salient, malicious desires and intentions to do harm, leading to the respective correlations with moral judgments of accidental and attempted harms. These hypotheses remain to be tested in future studies.  Second, moral judgments of accidents and attempts may depend on quantitatively different mental state attributions. Exculpating an agent for causing harm accidentally may require a more robust representation of the agent’s belief than blaming an agent for a failed attempt. In judging an accidental harm, participants must use belief information to override a pre-potent negative response to the actual harm (Young et al., 2007). In the case of attempted harms, the outcome is neutral, so there is no salient information competing with the belief. Indeed, in the case of attempted harms, it is the mental state that is salient, insofar as the stated belief information supports further inferences of malicious desires and intentions. Thus, in development, children ﬁrst use mental state information to assign blame for attempted harms, and only later learn to mitigate blame for accidents (e.g., Baird & Astington, 2004; Saxe, Carey, & Kanwisher, 2004). The strong correlation between RTPJ activation and exculpation for accidents may therefore reﬂect participants with especially robust belief representations. Conversely, children’s relative difﬁculty with exculpation may be partially due to insufﬁciently robust mental state representations. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent research suggests the RTPJ may be late maturing (cf. Blakemore, 2008; Gogtay et al., 2004). In particular, the func L. Young, R. Saxe / Neuropsychologia 47 (2009) 2065–2072  2071  tional selectivity of the RTPJ for beliefs increases over age, between 6 and 11 years (Saxe, Whitﬁeld-Gabrieli, Scholz, & Pelphrey, in press). We note, though, that for both children and adults, moral exculpation likely depends not only on the capacity for mental state reasoning but also on the capacity for cognitive control. Previously, we suggested that regions for cognitive control were recruited more robustly for accidental harm than for intentional harm (Young et al., 2007), though this pattern did not replicate in the current study.  Finally, moral judgments of accidents and attempts may depend on temporally different mental state attributions. There is some evidence that consideration of negative mental states, in attempted harms, is extended over time and continues even after participants deliver their negative moral judgments (Kliemann, Young, Scholz, & Saxe, 2008; Knobe, 2005), perhaps in an effort to further support the negative moral judgments. If so, then the corresponding neural response to attempted harms may be blurred over time, and not reliably located in the tight time window surrounding the participant’s button-press.  8. Other neural and cognitive processes  The predicted correlation between exculpatory moral judgment and neural response was observed in the RTPJ. This result is consistent with prior research suggesting that while other regions, including the LTPJ and MPFC support moral cognition (e.g., Greene et al., 2004) and social cognition (e.g., Mitchell, Macrae, & Banaji, 2006; Saxe & Wexler, 2005), the RTPJ may be more selective for representing beliefs both in non-moral contexts for the purpose of predicting and explaining behavior (e.g., Saxe & Powell, 2006; Perner et al., 2006) and for moral judgment (Young & Saxe, 2008). The precise role of the LTPJ and MPFC in judgment of moral scenarios, which vary the agent’s intention and the action’s outcome, is the topic of some of our previous and future research (Young & Saxe, 2008) and a number of studies on moral psychology (for a review, see Young & Koenigs, 2007). Undoubtedly, other brain regions (e.g., LTPJ), other cognitive processes (e.g., cognitive control, emotional empathy, emotion regulation), and other speciﬁc mental state factors (e.g., desires, goals, intentions) also contribute to moral judgment (Farrow et al., 2001; Heekeren, Wartenburger, Schmidt, Schwintowski, & Villringer, 2003; Koenigs & Tranel, 2007; Moll, Zahn, de Oliveira-Souza, Krueger, & Grafman, 2005). These contributions, including especially the role of the VMPFC in representing emotionally salient goals, desires, and intentions for moral judgments of failed attempts to harm, should be investigated in future research.  The current results reveal a speciﬁc role for the RTPJ in processing agents’ beliefs that they will do no harm. In criminal law, mistakes of fact may lead to mitigating the sentence. For future research, the law also offers a highly detailed model of the kinds and conditions of exculpation (Mikhail, 2007). First, even in the case of mistakes of fact, the mistake must be deemed “reasonable”. In ongoing work, we are investigating whether the RTPJ is involved in representing not only the content, but also the reasonableness, of exculpatory beliefs. Second, the law allows for many other defenses, beyond mistakes of fact. For example, the defendant may claim to have been acting in self-defense, or to have been provoked. In general, we expect that different brain regions and not necessarily the RTPJ will be correlated with consideration of these defenses, since they do not depend directly on establishing the agent’s mental states. However, these distinctions are not straightforward (e.g., the defendant must have reasonably believed that he was threatened). Finally, the law makes a distinction between two kinds of mistake: mistakes of fact (e.g., not knowing the powder was poison, which is exculpatory) and mistakes of law (e.g., not knowing it is wrong to poison someone, which is not). In future work, we will  investigate whether this legal distinction corresponds to a neural division.  9. Conclusions  In sum, different levels of activation in a speciﬁc brain region for mental state reasoning, the RTPJ, track with individual differences in exculpation. Moral judgment therefore depends not just on domain-general mechanisms for abstract reasoning, cognitive control, and emotional responding, but also on distinct neural substrates for interpreting the minds of moral agents. The results may have implications for normative models of moral cognition and theory of mind, as well as for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism that are characterized by theory of mind impairments (Blair, 1996; Leslie, Mallon, & DiCorcia, 2006). Future research in this area may also contribute to our broader understanding of forgiveness and punishment.

Various perspectives suggest that live interactions are more rewarding, more attention-grabbing, or require increased mentalizing—thinking about the thoughts of others. Dissociating between these possibilities is difﬁcult because most extant neuroimaging paradigms examining social interaction have not directly compared live paradigms to conventional “ofﬂine” (or recorded) paradigms. We developed a novel fMRI paradigm to assess whether and how an interactive context changes the processing of speech matched in content and vocal characteristics. Participants listened to short vignettes—which contained no reference to people or mental states—believing that some vignettes were prerecorded and that others were presented over a real-time audio-feed by a live social partner. In actuality, all speech was prerecorded. Simply believing that speech was live increased activation in each participant’s own mentalizing regions, deﬁned using a functional localizer. Contrasting live to recorded speech did not reveal signiﬁcant differences in attention or reward regions. Further, higher levels of autistic-like traits were associated with altered neural specialization for live interaction. These results suggest that humans engage in ongoing mentalizing about social partners, even when such mentalizing is not explicitly required, illustrating how social context shapes social cognition. Understanding communication in social context has important implications for typical and atypical social processing, especially for disorders like autism where social difﬁculties are more acute in live interaction.  © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This interchange, and the thousands of moments of their interaction before and after, can be decomposed into constituent parts: speech processing, gesture, gaze following. Each piece alone, however, is neither necessary nor sufﬁcient to create full, experienced interaction, with its emergent proprieties and attunement between social partners that extends beyond input and output stimuli. During real-time social interactions, social partners create a shared psychological state (Tomasello et al., 2005) necessary for successful communication. In this framework, communication is deﬁned not by the medium (e.g., language), but by the desire in the sender to create this shared psychological state, a recognition of that desire by the receiver, and the “shared intentionality” that the two partners create together (Clark, 1996; Sperber and Wilson, 1996; Tomasello et al., 2005). Characterizing the neural bases of communication will improve understanding of this core human behavior, with implications for social disabilities such as  ⁎ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.  autism, where impairments are most acute in social interaction (Klin et al., 2003).  Past neuroimaging research has almost exclusively examined the component pieces of communication (e.g., emotion understanding, language processing, thinking about others’ mental states), despite behavioral evidence that these processes operate differently in interactive, communicative contexts (Gallotti and Frith, 2013; Sebanz et al., 2006). For example, infant interaction with an adult promotes language learning more than observing matched recorded stimuli (Kuhl et al., 2003; Goldstein and Schwade, 2008). In adults, even the belief that one is interacting with another person’s avatar (versus an otherwise identical computer agent) improves learning (Okita et al., 2007; see Fox et al., 2015 for a review of avatar vs. agent literature). Individuals also show different gaze patterns when viewing a potential interactive partner as compared to a video (Freeth et al., 2013; Laidlaw et al., 2011; Risko et al., 2012), and naturalistic stimuli better distinguish typical and autism groups (Speer et al., 2007). Thus, although extant neuroimaging research has yielded important insight into the social brain, noninteractive methods cannot capture whether and how the social brain functions differently in social interaction (Schilbach et al., 2013).  Although evidence suggests real-time interaction may affect behavior, the question of how real-time interaction alters communication  K. Rice, E. Redcay / NeuroImage 129 (2016) 480–488  481  remains unanswered. Several theories suggest that a fundamental aspect of communication is making rapid inferences about a social partner’s communicative intentions and mental states even in simple interactions (e.g., gaze following; Teufel et al., 2009), although the exact nature of these inferences is debated (Clark, 1996; Klin et al., 2003; Shintel and Keysar, 2009; Sperber and Wilson, 1996; Teufel et al., 2009; Tomasello et al., 2005). Despite the possibility that communication and mental state inference—or mentalizing—are intertwined, both processes are typically studied separately in non-interactive contexts. For example, fMRI research identifying a “mentalizing network” has predominately focused on explicit reasoning about the mental state contents (e.g., beliefs) of characters in stories. The role of this brain network in ongoing interaction is unknown. One possibility is that although not all social interaction contains explicit mentalizing demands, implicit mentalizing processes—including tracking mental state content (Schneider et al., 2014b; Senju et al., 2009) and monitoring communicative intent (Kampe et al., 2003)—are more engaged when processing communicative cues from a real-time social partner versus recorded cues.  Greater demand on mentalizing systems is just one theorized difference between processing real-time communication and processing ofﬂine, component communicative behaviors. Other possibilities are that live, contingent interactions are more rewarding (Mundy and Neal, 2000; Pfeiffer et al., 2014; Schilbach et al., 2010, 2013), provide unique sources of information compared to recordings (e.g., responsive eye gaze; Kuhl, 2011), or capture more attention (Kuhl, 2007; Risko et al., 2012), perhaps due to increased arousal (Okita et al., 2007), than recorded stimuli. Finally, a tightly controlled experiment may reveal no differences in the processing of matched communicative behaviors in ofﬂine versus interactive contexts, suggesting that communication is the sum of its parts. Neuroimaging paradigms may be especially well suited to dissociate these possibilities and to identify the implicit, ongoing processes that are hypothesized to underlie communication and that are difﬁcult to assess via self-report (Schneider et al., 2014a).  Despite the promise of neuroimaging to illuminate communicative processes, extant interactive neuroimaging paradigms have not directly addressed whether and how interactive context changes the processing of well-matched input stimuli, either because that is not the direct question of interest or due to methodological limitations (Redcay et al., 2013b). Past interactive neuroimaging studies have contrasted contingent interaction to non-contingent recordings (Redcay et al., 2010, 2012; Schilbach et al., 2010) and compared direct to averted gaze (Holler et al., 2015), but such paradigms do not directly address whether live context alone alters the processing of well-matched input stimuli. Research in which participants play either human or computer opponents in various games (Coricelli and Nagel, 2009; Gallagher et al., 2002; McCabe et al., 2001) examines engagement with human versus non-human actors, but not how human communication differs in interactive versus non-interactive contexts. Further, such games often demand explicit mentalizing (e.g., deliberate reﬂection on an actor’s motive) and thus cannot determine the extent to which mentalizing is automatically engaged in day-to-day human communication (e.g., pointing to a balloon in the sky). Determining whether and how the neural systems underlying communication differ when communicative acts occur in interactive contexts requires targeted and wellcontrolled paradigms.  In this study, we employed a novel fMRI paradigm to address the vital gap in our understanding of the neural systems underlying interactive communication. Participants completed trials in which they listened to a short vignette presenting two options, then heard about someone’s preference, and made a choice for that person. For some trials, participants believed they were listening to a live social partner over a real-time audio-feed, whereas for other trials they believed they were listening to a recording of another person. Crucially, all stimuli were prerecorded, to ensure matched stimuli within and across participants. To match contingency and attention across conditions, participants saw  contingent positive or negative feedback based on their answer to each question. At the end of the experiment, participants completed ratings of liveness, likeability, and engagement for the live and recorded speakers.  Our main analysis examined neural responses during the short vignette portion (i.e., story), which contained no explicit mentalizing demands. Our aim was to identify the neural systems supporting social interaction beyond the processes supporting the interaction’s component parts (e.g., processing human speech). We hypothesized that the brain would be differentially engaged when participants perceived the speaker to be talking to them in real-time (i.e., Live) as compared to a matched recording, speciﬁcally in each participant’s mentalizing regions. We identiﬁed each individual’s mentalizing regions using a highly replicated language-based theory of mind localizer, which isolates reasoning about mental states from reasoning about physical inferences that are matched on representational and attentional demands (Dodell-Feder et al., 2011). Using a functional localizer is especially important in isolating the regions involved in mentalizing, as portions of the mentalizing network (e.g., TPJ) have also been implicated in more general attentional processes (Decety and Lamm, 2007; Mitchell, 2008) and overlap with portions of the default mode network (Mars et al., 2012; Schilbach et al., 2008; Spreng et al., 2009). As a control, we also compared two recorded conditions: a friendly, engaging voice (Social, which was contrasted with the Live condition), and a less engaging voice (Standard). This contrast between recorded conditions was designed to ensure that effects of audio characteristics, likeability, or attention were not driving differences between perceived live and recorded conditions.  Finally, we examined whether autistic-like personality traits were related to neural sensitivity to live interaction, given that autism has been associated with diminished response to live social partners (Klin et al., 2003) and with preserved explicit mentalizing but impaired online implicit mentalizing (Senju et al., 2009). Although all participants in the current study were typical adults, previous research has indicated that typical variability in autistic-like traits is related to behavioral and brain measures of social cognition (e.g., Barman et al., 2015; Bayliss and Tipper, 2005; Hasegawa et al., 2013; Nummenmaa et al., 2012; Miller and Saygin, 2013; Poljac et al., 2013), and there is evidence that the relation between autistic-like traits and social behavior in stronger in live than recorded contexts (Laidlaw et al., 2011). In particular, we theorized that individuals with higher levels of autistic-like traits would show diminished behavioral responsiveness to the live social partner (as measured by self-report) and diminished sensitivity to live versus recorded speech, especially in regions associated with mentalizing, which would provide evidence that sensitivity to social partners is a core social process.  Methods  Participants  Thirty-one adults (13 males), aged 18–27 years, participated in the neuroimaging study in exchange for course credit or payment. All participants were native English speakers, had normal hearing, normal or corrected-to-normal vision, no ﬁrst-degree relatives with autism or schizophrenia, and no personal history of any neurological impairments or psychological disorders. Two participants were excluded because they did not believe that the interaction in the live condition was live, yielding a ﬁnal sample of 29 adults. A subset (n = 23) of the ﬁnal sample completed a mentalizing localizer task, and analyses with the localizer regions were restricted to this subset. A separate sample of twenty adults (13 males), aged 18–29 years, completed pilot testing of the audio stimuli, and twenty other adults (8 males), aged 18– 28 years completed a behavioral version of the social interaction experiment. The local Institutional Review Board approved all study protocols.  482  K. Rice, E. Redcay / NeuroImage 129 (2016) 480–488  Social interaction experiment  Creating the live illusion  Participants were told that they would listen to short stories and answer questions, and that sometimes the stories and questions would be presented by a social partner via a real-time audio-feed, and that, for those items, they would receive real-time video feedback from the social partner (e.g., thumbs up). Participants were told that other trials would be prerecorded audio with computer-generated feedback. In actuality, all stimuli were prerecorded.  To maintain the live illusion, the experimenter wore the same clothing and had the same appearance as in the prerecorded feedback videos. Further, before the experiment, participants participated in a truly live video chat (Supplementary Fig. 1). Participants only met the live speaker. Participants were debriefed at the end of the experiment.  Task design  The task was programmed and presented using the Psychophysics Toolbox Extension for MATLAB 7.6 (PTB-3; Brainard, 1997). Participants viewed 36 individual trials across 4 runs, 12 from each condition: Live, Social, and Standard (Fig. 1). Each condition had a different female speaker: Live was the live social partner with a friendly tone; Social was a recorded, friendly voice; and Standard was a recorded, neutral voice. Each trial consisted of the story, answering a question by selecting one of two options and receiving feedback. Live feedback was a silent video of the live speaker, Social feedback was a standardized picture of a happy or sad female (Tottenham et al., 2009), and Standard feedback was a gold star or red “x.” During all audio, and for 2 s before the start of the story, a screen displayed either LIVE VOICE (in green text) or RECORDED (in orange text).  A 2- to 4-s jittered ﬁxation cross was present between the story and the question period and before feedback. There were also 20 s of baseline (ﬁxation cross) at the start, middle, and end of each run. Trial distribution and timing was determined by OptSeq (http://surfer.nmr.mgh. harvard.edu/optseq/). The event of interest was the story, and collinearity analysis using AFNI’s 3dDeconvolve (Cox, 1996) revealed that all beta values of interest were estimable.  Post-test procedure  Participants completed a 7-point Likert-scale questionnaire to assess perceptions of each speaker. For each speaker, participants were asked two questions to assess likeability (“How much did you like this speaker?” and “How much do you think you would like interacting in real life with this speaker?”), two questions to assess engagement (“How much did you pay attention when this speaker was talking?” and “How motivated were you to get the questions asked in her voice right?”), and three questions to assess liveness (“How much did your experiences with her feel live?” “How much did it feel like this speaker was talking directly to you?” and “How much did it feel like this speaker was interacting with you in real-time over a direct connection versus sounding like a recording?”). For each participant, we averaged together these scores on individual items to create composite liveness, likeability, and engagement scores for each speaker.  Participants also completed the Autism Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), which is a self-report measure of autistic-like personality traits. For each item (e.g., “I enjoy social situations”) participants answered on a scale of 1 (deﬁnitely agree) to 4 (strongly disagree), such that higher scores indicate more autistic-like traits. The AQ captures variability in ASD traits in the typical population (BaronCohen et al., 2001), and in typical individuals, higher AQ scores (more autistic-like traits) are related to diminished or atypical social cognitive abilities (e.g., perception of biological motion; Miller and Saygin, 2013; gaze cueing; Bayliss and Tipper, 2005; emotion perception; Poljac et al., 2013), atypical behavioral response to live but not recorded interaction (Laidlaw et al., 2011), and to neural activity in response to social stimuli (Barman et al., 2015; Hasegawa et al., 2013; Nummenmaa et al., 2012). The current sample showed variability in AQ scores, ranging from 8 to 29 (mean = 16.5, SD = 5.4), with all participants scoring below the conventional cutoff for clinical concern (a score of 32; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001).  Stimuli  Each of the three trial types (i.e., Live, Social, Standard) had a unique speaker. Given the current study’s within-subjects design, it was critical that participants were immediately aware of which condition they were in. To ensure immediate and reliable recognition of condition, each condition contained both a salient bottom-up cue (speaker voice) and top-down cue (background screen) as to condition.

Experimental trial structure. The three conditions (Live, Social, and Standard) are depicted in the three columns. Participants believed that audio in the Live condition was presented over a live audio-feed, and the other two conditions were recorded. The Live and Social speakers both had a friendly tone and the Standard speaker had a neutral tone. The content of the story portion was identical across conditions and consisted of a two-sentence description of two different objects that contained no reference to people or mental states (e.g., “There are two things on the breakfast menu. One is pancakes and one is a bowl of fruit.”). For Live trials, participants answered a question about the live social partner and for the Social and Standard conditions, participants answered question about a third party character (e.g., “I/Megan am/is trying to eat healthy. Which food should I/she eat?”). Participants saw contingent feedback based on their answer to the question. Experimental analyses were restricted to the story portion. s = seconds. (See also Supplementary Fig. 1 & Supplementary Table 1).  K. Rice, E. Redcay / NeuroImage 129 (2016) 480–488  483  All audio was normalized to 60 dB. We compared speakers on pitch and length of their audio clips using Praat 5.3 (Boersma, 2002; Supplementary Table 1). There were no length differences and, as intended, the Standard speaker was lower-pitched than the other speakers. For the story, the Social speaker had higher pitch than the Live speaker. To determine baseline ratings of liveness, likeability, and engagement for all three speakers, we conducted pilot testing (N = 20) in which participants listened to audio but were not told any stimuli were live. Unlike in the main experiment, participants did not meet any of the speakers, only heard third-person audio recordings (e.g., “What should Mary do?”), and saw the same feedback (gold star) for each speaker. There were signiﬁcant effects of speaker on ratings of liveness, likeability, and engagement (ps b .01; Supplementary Table 3C). The Social speaker was rated as more live and likeable than the Live speaker, and the Live speaker and Social speaker were more live, likeable, and engaging than the Standard speaker (ps b .05).  Each participant was assigned one of three stimuli sets, which differed on which 12 short vignette and question pairs were assigned to each condition, and ensured that the total amount of time for each condition was matched. The order of the items was randomized within condition and the order of runs was counterbalanced across participants.  Social interaction control behavioral study  In addition to the Live speaker being presented as live, there were three other differences between the Live and Social conditions: ﬁrstperson language (e.g., “I like”), video rewards, and meeting the speaker before the experiment. Given that this novel paradigm represents an initial attempt to understand the neural mechanisms of social interaction, we wanted to ensure that the social-interactive context was sufﬁciently believable (i.e., meeting the live partner before the experiment) and salient (i.e., being visually reminded of the live interaction via short videos of the live social partner, making a choice about the social partner). Although only the content-matched audio portion was analyzed, these three potential confounds were included in this initial study in order reinforce the live illusion and to create a more ecologically valid social context.  In order to determine if these three factors alone could produce perceived liveness, we conducted a separate behavioral study with N = 20 participants (who did not participate in the pilot behavioral experiment or scan) who completed the same task as the fMRI participants, including the post-test questionnaire (Supplementary Table 3B), but were told all stimuli were prerecorded.  Mentalizing localizer  A subset of participants (n = 23) completed a mentalizing localizer after the main social interaction experiment, in which they saw written stories about false beliefs and false physical representations (e.g., photographs; Dodell-Feder et al., 2011; http://saxelab.mit.edu/ superloc.php). Participants completed two runs, each with ﬁve false belief and ﬁve false photograph stories (presented for 10 s), followed by a true-false question presented for 4 s. The 14-second block was analyzed as one event.  Image acquisition and preprocessing  Imaging data were collected using a 12-channel head coil on a single Siemens 3.0-T scanner at the Maryland Neuroimaging Center (MAGNETOM Trio Tim System, Siemens Medical Solutions). The scanning protocol for each participant consisted of four runs of the main experiment (T2-weighted echo-planer gradient-echo; 36 interleaved axial slices; voxel size = 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.3 mm; repetition time = 2200 ms; echo time = 24 ms; ﬂip angle = 90°; pixel matrix = 64 × 64), two runs of the theory of mind localizer (T2 weighted echo-planer gradient-echo; 36 interleaved axial slices; voxel size = 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.3 mm; repetition time = 2000 ms; echo time = 24 ms; ﬂip angle = 90°; pixel matrix = 64 × 64), and a single structural scan (three-dimensional T1 magnetization-prepared rapid gradientecho sequence; 176 contiguous sagittal slices, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm; repetition time = 1900 ms; echo time = 2.52 ms; ﬂip angle = 9°; pixel matrix = 256 × 256). The parameters for the functional scans for the social interaction experiment were selected after piloting with four typical adults in order to best allow for signal preservation while maximizing speciﬁcity in regions prone to signal dropout.  For both the social interaction experiment and the mentalizing localizer, fMRI preprocessing was performed using SPM8 (http:// www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Data were slice-time corrected, realigned to the original volume from the ﬁrst functional run, and then normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template brain using both linear and nonlinear transformations. Data were high-pass ﬁltered (1/128 Hz) and spatially smoothed using a 5 mm full-width halfmaximum (fwhm) Gaussian kernel.  Outlying volumes (i.e., due to motion or global signal) for each participant were detected using the artifact detection toolbox (http://nitrc. org/projects/artifact_detect). Motion outliers were deﬁned as the difference between two consecutive volumes exceeding 1 mm (across translational and rotational movements), and global signal outliers were deﬁned as being three SD from the mean global signal. For the social interaction experiment, participants were to be excluded if, on two or more runs, their number of motion or global signal outliers exceeded 15% of collected volumes or if total motion exceeded 4 mm. No runs, however, met these criteria. For the theory of mind localizer, two participants had runs with between 15% and 20% outliers, but this motion was not correlated with the task and thus all subjects were included in analyses.  Data analysis  Social interaction experiment analysis  General linear models were used to estimate parameters for each condition’s story event. The model included each story event convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, and, as regressors of no interest, the anticipatory periods, the question periods, and the feedback periods. All six motion parameters (roll, pitch, yaw, x, y, and z) and each individual outlier time point were included as regressors. We analyzed two speciﬁc contrasts: ﬁrst, to examine the effect of live interaction we compared Live Story vs. Social Story; second, to isolate the effects of prosody and likeability, we compared Social Story vs. Standard Story. Given that the Standard Story was not well matched to the Live Story, that comparison was less theoretically interesting, and we did not analyze that contrast. Contrast maps were thresholded at a two-tailed p b .001 and cluster-corrected for multiple comparisons (overall alpha = .05, k = 93) using SPM’s false discovery rate algorithm. In order to examine individual differences in sensitivity to live interaction, we extracted each individual’s contrast value from the clusters identiﬁed in the group-level analysis. Speciﬁcally, we extracted each individual’s Social N Standard contrast values for the clusters showing a signiﬁcant effect of group for Social N Standard and similarly, Live N Social values for the clusters showing a signiﬁcant effect of group for Live N Social. We examined the correlations between these individual contrast values and both AQ scores and perceived liveness of the Live speaker. We speciﬁcally examined liveness (rather than likeability or engagement) as we designed this rating to quantify the participant’s experience of the live illusion.  Mentalizing localizer analysis  The regression model included the same motion and outlier nuisance regressors as the social interaction experiment and additional regressors for the belief and photo story conditions. To identify each  484  K. Rice, E. Redcay / NeuroImage 129 (2016) 480–488  individual’s regions associated with explicit mentalizing, we examined each participant’s whole-brain contrast for false belief vs. false photo stories at p b .001, k = 10 voxels, and identiﬁed peak coordinates for eight regions of interest within each participant (Young et al., 2007): bilateral TPJ, bilateral aSTS, precuneus, dMPFC, middle MPFC (mMPFC), and ventral MPFC (vMPFC). All participants with the localizer scan (n = 23) had identiﬁable activation in all regions except for mMPFC (n = 21) and vMPFC (n = 18). Voxels that were signiﬁcantly active within a 9 mm radius sphere surrounding each participant’s peak coordinate were used as regions of interest. Again, within each region, we analyzed two speciﬁc contrasts: ﬁrst, Live Story vs. Social Story to examine the effects of live social interaction on activation in mentalizing regions; and second, Social Story vs. Standard Story, to examine the effects of prosody and likeability in mentalizing regions. Given that our speciﬁc a priori hypotheses related to these pairwise comparisons, in order to minimize comparisons, we did not compare the effects of Live Story to Standard Story in these regions nor did we conduct a repeated-measures ANOVA across all three conditions.  Results  Perceived interactive context modulates brain response to speech  In order to examine how live interaction modulates the neural correlates of language processing, we compared BOLD activation during the story for the Live condition to the recorded Social condition. Wholebrain results demonstrated that processing speech from a live social partner modulated neural activity compared to processing matched recorded human speech (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table 2 & Supplementary Fig. 2), speciﬁcally in regions often associated with social cognition (i.e., mentalizing) and social engagement (Frith and Frith, 2006), including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and temporal parietal junction (TPJ).  Effect of live condition reﬂects perceived interactive communication  Perceived liveness is driven by the live illusion  To ensure that these whole-brain effects were due to perceived live interaction and were not reducible to other between-condition differences, we investigated several potential confounds. First, our condition manipulation relied on a participant’s belief that the Live condition was live. In order to conﬁrm and quantify belief in the illusion, all participants ﬁlled out rating scales after the fMRI session. All participants believed the live illusion. To further check the top-down manipulation of  perceived liveness, we examined participant ratings of speaker liveness (e.g., “How much did it feel like this speaker was talking directly to you?”). Participants rated the Live speaker as signiﬁcantly more live than the Social speaker (p b .001; Fig. 3A; Supplementary Table 3A). Greater perceived liveness of the Live speaker was also marginally correlated with greater activation for Live vs. Social speech in rDMPFC (r = .34, p = .07), as measured by individually extracted contrast values from the group-deﬁned cluster, although correlations with perceived liveness were not signiﬁcant for any of the other identiﬁed regions. Further, there was also no correlation between perceived liveness and Social vs. Standard speech activation in right STG, the region deﬁned by that group-level contrast (r b .1).  In addition to evidence from the neuroimaging study, an additional behavioral experiment with a separate group of participants (N = 20) was conducted to analyze factors that were confounded with the live condition. These potential confounds were included to enhance the illusion of liveness: participants met only the live speaker brieﬂy before the start of the experiment, saw the live speaker give ostensibly live video feedback, and heard the live speaker use ﬁrst-person language in the unanalyzed question portion. In this separate study, where live stimuli were presented as recorded, these three confounding factors failed to produce signiﬁcantly higher liveness ratings for the Live compared to Social speaker (Supplementary Table 3B). That is, only when participants were told that they were interacting with a live social partner did they actually rate that speaker as feeling signiﬁcantly more live.  Effects of live context are not reducible to other differences between conditions  One factor that could account for differences between live and recorded interactions is differences in attention. To examine this, we compared reaction time across conditions for the question that followed the story and found no signiﬁcant differences (F b 1, Supplementary Table 4). There were also no signiﬁcant between-condition differences in accuracy, but the very high accuracy for all questions precludes using that measure to make interpretations about levels of attention across conditions.  Self-reported social engagement and speaker likeability, however, did differ across conditions. Participants rated the Live speaker as more likeable and socially engaging than the Social speaker (ps b .01). Thus, to ensure that whole-brain Live N Social effects were not driven by likeability or engagement, we compared Social and Standard speakers, who also differed on likeability and engagement (ps b .01). This comparison also helped isolate any low-level effects of audio characteristics, as both Live versus Social and Social versus Standard  A  B     Right  Left   t=1  t=5  Effect of Live Speech  Live > Social (Recorded)  Effect of Friendly Speech  Social > Standard (Both Recorded)     s t i a r T e k L c  i  x=9  i t s  i t u A  r=-.41 p=.03  Right dMPFC Specialization   for Live vs. Matched Recorded Speech  Fig. 2.

Liveness Rating (Live Speaker)  Liveness Rating (Live Speaker)  Fig. 3. Behavioral impressions of speaker liveness. (A) Perceived liveness is driven by the illusion of a live setup. All scanned participants (N = 29) were told that the Live condition was live, and they rated the live and matched recorded (i.e., Social) speakers as signiﬁcantly different on a post-test questionnaire of perceived liveness. Perceived liveness was assessed using a composite of Likert-scale items scored on a 1 to 7 scale (e.g., how direct the speaker seemed, how much it seemed as though the speaker was in the room with the participant). This difference disappeared on an identical behavioral version of the task in which participants (N = 20) were told all audio—including audio from the scan’s Live speaker—was prerecorded. (B) Perceptions of liveness for the Live condition speaker were signiﬁcantly correlated with autistic-like traits (as measured by the Autism Quotient) only for the group that thought they were participating in a live interaction. For both groups, correlations with Autism Quotient scores and perceived liveness of the Social speaker were not signiﬁcant. ***p b .001 (see also Supplementary Table 3).  conditions differed on mean pitch. The comparison of the two not-live conditions (Social N Standard) only implicated regions frequently associated with auditory and speech processing (right superior temporal gyrus), and the speciﬁc activation was consistent with pitch responsivity (www.neurosynth.org; posterior probability for pitch = 0.87). There was no overlap in regions identiﬁed by the Live N Social and Social N Standard comparisons.  Ongoing mentalizing supports communicative interaction  Given that additional analyses revealed that the Live N Social effects were driven by the experimental manipulation of a simulated live interaction and not by potential confounding effects, we next examined the Live N Social contrast in each participant’s individually identiﬁed mentalizing network (deﬁned using an independent localizer; DodellFeder et al., 2011). All eight mentalizing regions showed the hypothesized pattern of results: increased activation for live versus recorded social speech. Speciﬁcally, this difference was signiﬁcant in six of the eight identiﬁed regions: bilateral TPJ (right: t(22) = 3.67, p = .001; left: t(22) = 4.21, p b .001), precuneus (t(22) = 2.30, p = .032), dMPFC (t(22) = 2.33, p = .029), middle MPFC (t(20) = 3.97, p b .001), and ventral MPFC (t(17) = 4.25, p b .001). The difference between Live and Social was in the same direction but did not reach significance for the remaining two regions: right (t(22) = 1.99, p = .059) and left (t(22) = 1.82, p = .083) anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS). After applying a Holm–Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (Holm, 1979), signiﬁcant differences between Live and Social remained in bilateral TPJ, middle MPFC, and ventral MPFC (corrected ps b .01).  Autistic-like personality traits relate to processing live stimuli  Autism Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) scores, which measure autistic-like traits, were signiﬁcantly correlated with perceived liveness for the Live condition (Fig. 3B), but not the Social (r(27) = −.27, p = .17) nor Standard (r(27) = .13, p = .49) conditions, such that greater autistic-like personality traits were related to diminished perceptions of live social interaction during the Live condition. This correlation between AQ scores and perceived liveness remained signiﬁcant after controlling for both engagement and likeability ratings (r(25) = −.54, p = .003). AQ scores were not correlated with perceived liveness for any of the speakers in the control behavioral experiment when participants were told that all conditions were prerecorded.  Given that activation in right dMPFC for Live vs. Social speech was correlated with perceived liveness, we next examined the relation between AQ scores and specialization for live speech in this region. AQ scores were also signiﬁcantly correlated with specialization in right dMPFC (deﬁned by the group-level contrast) for Live vs. Social speech (Fig. 2B). Participants with higher levels of autistic-like traits showed diminished neural specialization for live versus matched recorded speech. Additional analyses with the other three group-identiﬁed clusters revealed a negative trend in left dMPFC (r = −.36, p = .06) and a significant positive relation in left angular gyrus (r = .37, p = .045). There was no correlation between AQ scores and activation to Social vs. Standard speech in the right STG cluster deﬁned by the corresponding group-level contrast (r b .1).  Discussion  This study used a novel paradigm to isolate the neural systems subserving live human communication. Speciﬁcally, this paradigm identiﬁed the neural mechanisms underlying the differential processing of otherwise well-matched stimuli in live and recorded contexts. Participants completed an fMRI task in which they listened to two types of prerecorded speech: speech that they believed was being spoken in real-time by the experimenter in another room over a live audio-feed (Live) and matched human speech that participants knew was recorded (Social). Analyses of the content- and prosody-matched story portion revealed that simply believing that a social partner was speaking in real-time more strongly activated social cognitive regions, speciﬁcally in each participant’s independently identiﬁed mentalizing network. Further investigation revealed that this effect was not attributable to low-level differences in audio characteristics, speaker likeability, or attention, and was instead driven by perceptions of speaker liveness. These perceptions of liveness and neural responses to live interaction were related to Autism Quotient (AQ) scores; individuals with higher levels of autistic-like personality traits were less sensitive to the live context.  In the current paradigm, the analyzed speech segments did not contain any explicit mentalizing demands, and yet live speech still more strongly activated the mentalizing network. This ﬁnding indicates that mentalizing may be a critical component of real-time interaction. Live interaction did not increase activation in attention or reward networks, in contrast to some past ﬁndings examining social interaction (Pfeiffer et al., 2014; Schilbach et al., 2010). The current paradigm, however, made efforts to control contingency and attention between conditions, and no reaction time differences were found between conditions. Past interactive studies that have found reward system activation have examined interacting with humans versus computers (Pfeiffer et al., 2014) or the effect of directing another person’s attention (Schilbach et al., 2010), neither of which was examined in the current paradigm. Importantly, the null ﬁnding of the current study does not contradict  486  K. Rice, E. Redcay / NeuroImage 129 (2016) 480–488  evidence suggesting that humans are intrinsically motivated to engage with others (Chevallier et al., 2012; Tomasello, 2008) and that motivational brain networks play an important role in social interaction, but rather indicates that real-world, dynamic interaction is likely subserved by several systems, which may be targeted by different contexts.  Activation in regions identiﬁed by the mentalizing localizer provides strong evidence that the regions engaged by live stimuli in the current study are part of the network involved in explicit mental state inference. Speciﬁcally, although regions from the broader mentalizing network have also been implicated in more domain-general processes (e.g., attention), this functional localizer matched attentional and other cognitive demands across mentalizing and control items in order to identify, for each individual, the regions associated with mental state reasoning. Further, the regions identiﬁed by the localizer revealed no increased activation for the more friendly recorded condition versus the more standard recorded condition, despite the fact that these conditions differed on self-reported engagement and low-level audio characteristics. Thus, although it is possible that other processes support the complex phenomenon of live interaction, these convergent results suggest that the mentalizing network is altered during social interaction.  In the context of the current study, it is unknown how these regions involved in explicit mentalizing subserve interaction. Perhaps most straightforwardly, participants could be engaging in more explicit or even implicit (Schneider et al., 2014a, 2014b) reasoning about the mental state contents of the live versus recorded speaker within the context of experimental task demands. Three factors, however, argue against this interpretation: ﬁrst, the analyzed story portion did not contain mentalizing language; second, the mental state content in the unanalyzed question portion of the trial was matched across conditions; and third, there were no behavioral differences between conditions on the questions after each story, which required mental state reasoning to answer.  Given the highly controlled experimental context, increased activation in the mentalizing network may result from tracking belief states beyond task demands. For example, individuals may reﬂect on the evaluative or interpersonal mental states of the live social partner (e.g., Does she think I am giving quick enough answers?) but not of the recorded speakers. This ongoing monitoring of the mental states of a social partner, perhaps particularly in regards to how that social partner perceives the interaction, may assist in the creation of a shared psychological state and ensure successful communication. Another possibility is that the mentalizing system is more active not because of ongoing mental state reasoning, but rather because live interaction inherently contains the possibility of suddenly needing to consider another’s mental state. That is, the system is primed for activation. Both of these possibilities speak to facets of human interpersonal understanding that may separate live interaction from the sum of its component pieces.  Alternatively, rather than the mentalizing system supporting quantitatively “more” belief state reasoning during live interaction, it is possible that the mentalizing system is engaged in a qualitatively different way. Computationally, the live and recorded conditions are equally demanding in terms of understanding spoken language and making mental state inferences. Thus, perhaps increased activation in these regions during live speech is not driven by differences in representational content, but rather by this network’s broader role in social interaction. The exact nature of this role is unknown, but may involve the rapid, ongoing representation of a social partner that underlies phenomena such as social resonance, synchrony, and coordination (Garrod and Pickering, 2004; Kopp, 2010). Interestingly, previous fMRI studies of speech comprehension have implicated regions also involved in mentalizing (e.g., aSTS; Scott et al., 2000, MPFC; Obleser et al., 2007, pSTS; review, Redcay, 2008, and TPJ; review, Mar, 2011), suggesting a coupling between social and speech processing within this network. Future research should continue to investigate the role of mentalizing systems in speech processing even outside of live contexts.  Due to the constrained and controlled nature of the current paradigm, increased activity in the mentalizing network was necessarily  driven by primarily top-down information (i.e., participants were told stimuli were live) as opposed to more bottom-up cues (e.g., real-time contingency, nonverbal synchrony, “interactive alignment”; Pfeiffer et al., 2014; Garrod and Pickering, 2004). This top-down information about speaker liveness affected other judgments about the speaker: as compared to a control experiment where participants knew the live speaker was recorded, simply being told that the speaker was live signiﬁcantly increased ratings of social engagement and likeability for that speaker. Ontogenetically, in contrast, the perception of live interaction unspools via bottom-up cues and is likely implicit, given that young infants are sensitive to contingent interaction (Murray and Trevarthen, 1985). How these bottom-up processes differ from the top-down experimental manipulation of liveness in the current study is unclear. Understanding factors inﬂuencing the perception of social interaction has implications for real-world pedagogical contexts, including listening to and learning from live versus recorded material, and is an important direction for future study.  Differential behavioral and neural response to live social partners has implications for autism. Research suggests that social disability in autism may result from a developmental cascade beginning with early disengagement from social stimuli (Klin et al., 2003; Pelphrey et al., 2011). Although the current study examined typical individuals, higher AQ scores were associated with diminished neural sensitivity to live versus recorded speech in dMPFC, a region linked to atypical ASD activation during live interaction (Redcay et al., 2013a), but not during ofﬂine, explicit mentalizing (Dufour et al., 2013). The mechanism driving this association in the current sample is unclear, but one possibility is found in the behavioral ratings of speaker liveness. Higher AQ scores were correlated with lower ratings of perceived liveness of the live speaker, but not the recorded speakers, and, further, increased perceived liveness of the live speaker was related to increased activation in dMPFC. Although the current sample size precludes a mediation analysis, the relation between AQ scores and sensitivity to live social partners is concordant with the hypothesis that individuals with autism feel less social resonance with their social partners (Izuma et al., 2011; Klin et al., 2003) and suggests that heightened sensitivity for live social partners may characterize typical social development. Interestingly, left angular gyrus specialization for live speech was associated with increased levels of autistic-like traits. This angular gyrus cluster did not overlap with regions identiﬁed by the mentalizing localizer, suggesting a nonlinear pattern where reduced sensitivity to live interaction within the mentalizing system, but increased sensitivity outside of this system, may be associated with atypical social processing. Given that the current study had a relatively small number of individuals with high levels of autistic-like traits, however, future work should examine larger typical samples and also test individuals with autism in similar paradigms.  For this initial within-subjects approach to understanding the effect of live interaction on communication, we needed to ensure a believable and salient interactive setup. We thus created an experiment that ensured participants believed the live illusion (i.e., meeting the live partner beforehand) and that reinforced to participants that they were engaging with a real social partner (i.e., “live” videos of the partner, hearing the partner use ﬁrst-person language, hearing a different speaker for the recorded trials). Indeed, this manipulation had a high success rate as 29 out of 31 adults believed the live illusion. However, interpretations of the current paradigm are limited by the fact that the matched live speech was embedded in this social context. Although our additional analyses indicate that these confounds are not driving the results, future work could employ paradigms with sparser social context. For example, participants could listen to the same speaker, but be told for some trials that the speaker is live and for other trials that the speaker is recorded. If these two conditions do not reveal differences in neural activation, it is possible that with all other factors controlled, belief that speech is presented via a real-time audiofeed is not enough to alter neural processing. However, it is also possible that without a richer social context, participants would ﬁnd the live stimuli less believable or  K. Rice, E. Redcay / NeuroImage 129 (2016) 480–488  487  that, given the sparse, top-down instruction, the live nature of the stimuli would not be salient enough to affect speech processing (cf. Okita et al., 2007). Future studies could manipulate various aspects of socialinteractive setups to help isolate the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions to observe the effects found in the current study.  The current study offers important insight into understanding a fundamental human behavior: communication. Regions of the mentalizing network have been most frequently conceptualized as carrying out specific social cognitive computations (e.g., determining another’s beliefs). The current study illustrates that, even when explicit social cognitive demands are held constant, the mentalizing network is sensitive to social interaction. Speciﬁcally, this paradigm demonstrates that merely believing that you are listening to a live speaker (versus a matched recording) changes the neural correlates of processing speech, speciﬁcally by increasing activation in traditionally deﬁned mentalizing regions. Although the current paradigm only examined spoken language, research suggests that the communicative medium is less important than the creation of a shared psychological state (Noordzij et al., 2009; Stolk et al., 2014). Suggestively, the regions identiﬁed in the current study are similar to those identiﬁed in studies of interactive but nonverbal joint visual attention (Redcay et al., 2010, 2012). In addition to illuminating the neural mechanisms underlying interaction, the current ﬁndings attest to the necessity of studying communicative cues (e.g., speech) in a communicative context. Future research on disorders characterized by social disabilities that are more acute in live interaction, such as autism and social anxiety, should consider the role of communicative context; interactive paradigms may be more suited to identify these disorders’ neural mechanisms. Ultimately, if scientists have the goal of understanding human behavior, such study must take into account human context.

Insight into the brain basis of the dynamic nature of emotional reactivity may be critical for understanding chronic symptoms of anxiety and depression. Here, individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and healthy controls watched a video with dynamic aﬀective content while fMRI activity was recorded. Across all participants there was a large-scale tracking of aﬀective content in emotion processing regions and the default mode network. Anxious and depressed individuals displayed less brain-based coupling within these regions and the extent of this uncoupling correlated with variability in emotional numbing. Thus, abnormal neural tracking of aﬀective information during dynamic emotional episodes appears to represent a disconnection between aﬀective cues in the environment and an individual’s response to these cues—providing a putative neural basis for context insensitive aﬀective reactivity and emotional numbing.  1. Introduction  Imagine your response to hearing a loud and unexpected door slam. When you notice that the person entering the door is a dear friend or relative, your emotional response quickly changes from one of startle and worry, to one of joy. On the other hand, if the person entering the room is unknown to you, perhaps holding a weapon, you are likely to maintain your response of startle and worry. This is just one example of how the human emotional response is a complex phenomenon that continuously evolves as we interact with our environment. Yet, research into the brain basis of emotional processing has primarily measured responses to “emotional” and “neutral” stimuli in a binary “on vs. oﬀ” fashion (Phan et al., 2002). This research has been invaluable in establishing a core network of emotion processing regions including, among others, the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula. Although emotional stimuli are typically presented in a static binary fashion, the neural response to these stimuli is not “on or oﬀ”, but rather varies in relation to the relative intensity of the stimulus (Anders et al., 2004; Canli et al., 2002; Carlson et al., 2011; Engell et al., 2007; Taylor et al., 2003; Waugh et al., 2010). Yet, little is known about how the brain responds to dynamic emotional content. Given that our day-to-day emotional responses are driven by dynamic  interactions with the environment, it is important to establish a line of cognitive neuroscience research into the neural correlates of dynamic emotional reactivity in more naturalistic settings (Zaki and Ochsner, 2009).  This is particularly true for disorders such as anxiety and depression, which are characterized by abnormal dynamics in emotion processing such as prolonged and unexplainable feelings of worry, hopelessness, despair, and anhedonic numbing (DSM-IV., 2000; DSMV., 2013). According to the emotion context insensitivity view of depression, depressed individuals are insensitive to both emotionally positive and negative environmental stimuli, which results in a broadly blunted aﬀective response (Bylsma et al., 2008; Rottenberg et al., 2005). Behavioral research has found that depressed individuals show a blunted aﬀective response to both positive and negative emotional movies (Rottenberg et al., 2005, 2002). Researchers have also assessed emotional reactivity in depression using functional neuroimaging. The “default mode network” (DMN) consisting of the posterior cingulate (PCC), precuneus, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), & medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is more active during non-task states and less active during experimental tasks (Raichle et al., 2001).

Activation of the DMN during emotional tasks—when it should be less active—is in line with an insensitivity to environmental cues in depression. Depression has also been associated with hyperactive amygdala reactivity to threatening stimuli (Canli et al., 2004; Sheline et al., 2001; Siegle et al., 2007). Thus, depression is associated with both blunted and exaggerated, context insensitive, aﬀective responses. Exaggerated, context insensitive, responses are also characteristic of anxiety (Etkin et al., 2004, 2009; Monk et al., 2008; Nitschke et al., 2009). For example, anxiety is characterized by unexplainable excessive worry and neuroimaging studies aimed at measuring states of worry or anxious anticipation have found that anxiety is associated with an increased response in the amygdala, ACC, and insula both in anticipation of aversive (Carlson et al., 2011; Simmons et al., 2006; Stein et al., 2007), but also neutral stimuli (Nitschke et al., 2009). Further evidence suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which usually displays a graded response from threat to safety (Greenberg et al., 2013a), is ﬂat-lined in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder and those comorbid with anxiety and depression (Greenberg et al., 2013b), which may result from multiple underlying structural abnormalities within the fear circuit (Cha et al., 2014b). A similar ﬂat-lining has been observed in the ventral tegmental area for anxious individuals with and without comorbidity for depression (Cha et al., 2014a). Additionally, anxious individuals that are comorbid with depression show a blunted startle response similar to that observed in pure depression (Taylor-Clift et al., 2011). Thus, anxiety and depression are highly comorbid, due in part to overlapping symptoms. However, the symptoms of anhedonia and anxious arousal characterize “pure” cases of MDD and GAD, respectively (Watson et al., 1995). Both disorders appear to be associated with abnormal sensitivity to emotional cues within the environment.  Neuroimaging research has adopted the use of multimodal and dynamic naturalistic visual stimuli such as movies and virtual worlds (Bartels and Zeki, 2004a, 2004b; Hasson et al., 2004; Malinen et al., 2007). Initial research using such naturalistic stimuli has primarily focused on so-called “inter-subject correlations” of shared perceptual processing across individuals (Bartels and Zeki, 2004b; Hasson et al., 2004). A study by Nummenmaa and colleagues (2012) suggests that the widespread inter-subject synchronization of brain activity in visual, emotional, and default mode networks during natural vision is linked to emotion. Additional research by Zaki and colleagues (2009) has revealed that the ability to track others' aﬀective state during natural vision is associated with activity in the mPFC and IPL. Other research using naturalistic stimuli has also found that the DMN and emotion processing regions track positive and negative emotions (Goldin et al., 2005; Hutcherson et al., 2005). Although these studies provide initial evidence that naturalistic stimuli can be eﬀective tools in the study of emotional processing and social cognition, the neural system(s) involved in tracking dynamic emotional content remains under studied. Of critical importance, it is unclear to what extent abnormal neural coupling with dynamic aﬀective cues contributes to mood abnormalities in anxiety and depression.  Here, patients with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, those comorbid for anxiety and depression, and a sample of healthy controls viewed the pilot episode of ABC's TV-seriesLost (42 min) while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired. Immediately after viewing the episode, participants rated arousal and valence levels for each scene. We hypothesized that activity in sensory regions, emotion processing regions (e.g., amygdala, ACC, and insula), and the DMN would correlate with valence and arousal ratings. Further, we expected to see a greater correlation between the aﬀective content of the episode and neural activity in healthy controls compared to anxious and depressed individuals; especially in emotion processing regions and the DMN.  2. Methods  2.1. Participants  Sixty consenting adult females recruited from a university community participated in the study (Mage =22.52, SDage =5.62). Our sample contained patients with generalized anxiety disorder (n =17), major depressive disorder (n =15), those comorbid for anxiety and depression (n =15), and healthy controls (n =13). Participants in this study represent a subsample of individuals with minimal motion ( < 4 mm see Supplementary Table 1) from a larger age matched adult sample (N =94). However, groups diﬀered on mean frame displacement (F (3, 56) =4.37, p < 0.05). The resulting subsample of participants also diﬀered in age across groups with patients (GAD Mage=23, MDD Mage=26, COM Mage=21) generally being slightly older than controls (Mage=20, F (3, 56) =3.28, p < 0.05). To help control for these diﬀerences, age and mean frame displacement were included as covariates (see the MRI acquisition and analysis section for more). G*Power 3.1.9.2 was used to determine whether the remaining subsample was suﬃciently powered. Using a α=0.05, power =0.80, and a large eﬀect of d =0.8, it was determined that an N =54 would be needed. Thus, our subsample of N =60 was suﬃciently powered for eﬀect sizes of d ≥0.8. Additional demographic data for participant groups can be found in Supplementary Table 2.  Given that anxiety and depression are more commonly diagnosed in females, we only recruited women to reduce gender-related heterogeneity in the sample. All participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (Axis I Disorders—Patient Edition, Version 2) (DSM-IV., 2000) by trained clinical psychologists at Stony Brook University to conﬁrm diagnoses of GAD, MDD, or comorbidity in the patient groups as well as the absence of Axis-I diagnoses in the healthy group. Participants were free from psychotropic medication for at least six months prior to the time of the experiment and with no history of substance abuse/dependence. The healthy control group had no diagnosable lifetime Axis I disorder and no history of neurological illness. Prior to scanning, participants were screened for metal and other MRI contraindications. The Stony Brook University Institutional Review Board approved the study.  2.2. Questionnaires  Participants completed questionnaires intended to measure speciﬁc symptoms of anxiety and depression including the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ), which includes the following four subscales: General Distress Anxiety (11 items), General Distress Depression (12 items), Anxious Arousal (17 items), and Anhedonic Depression (22 items). The General Distress Anxiety and General Distress Depression subscales are thought to capture symptoms more common to both disorders, while the Anhedonic Depression and Anxious Arousal subscales capture symptoms speciﬁc to depression and anxiety, respectively. The disorder-speciﬁc subscales exhibit convergent and discriminant validity (Watson et al., 1995) and overall the MASQ has good internal consistency (α > 0.80). We also included the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) to assess symptoms of worry (16 items), which are characteristic of anxiety (Meyer et al., 1990). Summary Data are presented in Supplementary Table 3.  from these questionnaires  2.3. Stimulus  Participants viewed the entire pilot episode of ABC's TV-series Lost in a continuous uninterrupted scanning session lasting 42 min. Approximately, half of the participants reported previously watching  38  J.M. Carlson et al.  Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 260 (2017) 37–48  Fig. 1. During the experiment participants ﬁrst watched the entire pilot episode of Lost in an uninterrupted scanning session for 42 min (Upper). Immediately afterward participants again watched the video stimulus. However, during the second viewing, the video was segmented into 200 scenes (10–15 s/scene). After each scene participants rated the valence and arousal levels for each scene using the nine-point Self-Assessment Manikin (Bradley and Lang, 1994) (Lower).  the episode (M =55%). However, there was no diﬀerence in previous exposure to the stimulus between groups (Χ2 =0.37, p=0.95). This episode follows a group of plane crash survivors who are stranded on a remote island and are forced to deal with a number of challenges ranging from crash-related deaths and injuries to mysterious threats encountered on the island. Although the episode is more focused on negative emotional content, the nature of this content is not extremely aversive. Such aversive content has previously been shown to be stress inducing (Cousijn et al., 2010; van Marle et al., 2009). The episode also contains positive and neutral character interactions, which makes the episode ideal for assessing reactivity across the valence spectrum. We used Experiment Builder software to play the movie, which was projected using an MRI compatible 60 Hz projector with a 1024×768 resolution. Auditory stimuli were presented through Serene Sound (Resonance Technology Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) 30 dB external noise attenuating MRI-compatible headphones. During this viewing participants were not asked to make any responses, but rather were allowed to watch the episode as they would naturally. Using an MRI compatible video camera we veriﬁed that all participants’ eyes were open and viewed the episode as intended.  2.4. Ratings  Immediately after watching the episode in the scanner, participants re-watched the episode and rated the content of the show on a ninepoint Self-Assessment Manikin (i.e., SAM) scale (Bradley and Lang, 1994) in terms of valence ("How pleasant do you feel? " from 1= negative to 9= positive) and arousal ("How excited do you feel? " from 1= low arousal to 9 high arousal; see Fig. 1). Ratings were obtained for each of the two hundred 10–15 second scenes that the episode was split into. The segmented version of the episode was only used for the rating portion. Participants watched the entire 10–15 s scene and were ﬁrst asked to rate each scene’s valence level and then each scene’s arousal level. The rating prompt for valence and arousal remained on the screen until the participant responded. Participants were asked to rate the scenes based on how they felt in the scanner (if there was a discrepancy between their emotional state between the two viewings). Rating sessions were self-paced, but typically lasted approximately 1 h.  2.5. MRI acquisition and analysis  A Siemens MAGNETOM Trio Tim 3 T whole body scanner equipped with an 12 channel head coil was used to acquire 1190 T2*-weighted echoplanar images with an oblique coronal angle and repetition time (TR) =2100 ms, echo time (TE) =23 ms, ﬂip angle =83◦,  matrix =96×96, ﬁeld of view (FOV) =224×224 mm, slices =37 and slice thickness =3.5 mm. Participants also underwent scans for resting state fMRI, T1-weighted structural MRI, and diﬀusion tensor-weighted MRI. The scanning parameters for these additional scans have previously been reported (Cha et al., 2014b).  Standard preprocessing procedures including slice time correction, motion correction, normalization, and smoothing with a 6-mm full width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel were performed in SPM8 (www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Preprocessed images were entered into a ﬁrst-level regression model in which arousal (1st) and valence (2nd) ratings were included as regressors of interest, while the 6 motion parameters estimated during realignment were included as regressors (3rd–8th) of no interest. Ratings data were converted to TRs to match the length of the show, and included a 3 s lag to account for the delay in the hemodynamic response (Hasson et al., 2004). As our predictor variables we used the average ratings data across participants (Fig. 2). Averaging the rating data allows for the elimination of noise (error) from the single subject ratings and therefore provide a stronger more robust measure of emotional content. Indeed, prior research has shown that average/consensus ratings are better predictors of neural activity than individual ratings (Engell et al., 2007). It should be noted that both individuals and groups rated the data in a very similarly pattern (see Results). Thus, the ﬁrst-level analysis produced individual contrast ﬁles of standardized beta-weights (i.e., correlation maps) representing the correlations between ratings regressors (valence and arousal) and voxel-wise hemodynamic activity for each participant. Two secondlevel one-way ANOVAs were performed using group (GAD, MDD, Comorbid, & Control) as a between subjects factor to test for diﬀerences in arousal and valence tracking or coupling (based on ﬁrst-level contrast ﬁles of beta-weights).1 Age and mean frame displacement were included as covariates to help control for potential age- or motion-related inﬂuences on our comparisons between patient and control groups. For overall eﬀects a Family-Wise Error (FWE) corrected threshold of p < 0.01 with 20 continuous voxels was used. For subtler patient eﬀects, a region of interest approach was used. Initially, an uncorrected p < 0.005 with 20 continuous voxels was used. Then, a FWE small volume correction was applied using a 10 mm sphere centered on coordinates from local maximas identiﬁed in the analysis of the overall eﬀects for valence and arousal. Parameter estimates were extracted from regions showing a signiﬁcant group diﬀerence to assess which symptoms of anxiety and depression (see Questionnaires  1 Note that at the second-level, the contrast ﬁles used and the general analysis speciﬁcation process is identical to that used for standard task-based GLMs where the beta maps represent task condition-based eﬀects (rather than our ratings regressors).  39  J.M. Carlson et al.  Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 260 (2017) 37–48  Fig. 2. As can be seen from the average rating data (Upper), throughout the viewing, participants’ aﬀective response was continuously ﬂuctuating from periods of high arousal and negative valence (e.g., shaded red area) to low arousal and positive valence (e.g., shaded blue area). Note that the these descriptions (Bottom) are meant to represent a brief snapshot of the dynamic scenes in the highlighted peaks and troughs.  section) best explained variability in the coupling of aﬀective content and brain activity.  3. Results  3.1. Behavioral ratings  The average ratings data are displayed in Fig. 3 and indicate that the episode contained dynamic shifts in aﬀective content with mean valence ratings of scenes ranging from 2.00 to 6.83 and mean arousal ratings ranging from 2.77 to 8.03. Valence and arousal ratings were highly correlated such that the high levels of reported arousal were associated with greater levels of reported negative aﬀect (r =−0.78, p < 0.001). As can be seen in Fig. 3, this negative relationship between valence and arousal was true for control (r =−0.79, p < 0.001), GAD (r =−0.82, p < 0.001), MDD (r =−0.74, p < 0.001), and comorbid (r =−0.60, p < 0.001) groups.  A comparison of the four groups revealed a diﬀerence in the average rating across all scenes (F (3, 56) =3.32, p=0.03) where in post-hoc comparisons GAD patients had signiﬁcantly lower (i.e., more negative) valence ratings compared to MDD patients (p=0.006), controls (p=0.02) and the diﬀerence between GAD and comorbid patients approached signiﬁcance (p=0.08). There were no other signiﬁcant diﬀerences in valence ratings and diﬀerences in arousal ratings were not signiﬁcant, F (3, 56) =1.34, p=0.28). Groups did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer in terms of variability (i.e., Standard Deviation) for valence (F (3, 56) =1.15, p=0.34) or arousal ratings (F (3, 56) =0.34, p=0.80; see Table 1 for M, SD, and Range data for each group). Ratings from the control (r =0.96, p < 0.001; r =0.98, p < 0.001), GAD (r =0.98, p < 0.001; r =0.99, p < 0.001), MDD (r =0.96, p < 0.001; r =0.98, p < 0.001), and comorbid (r =0.94, p < 0.001; r =0.98, p < 0.001) groups were all very highly correlated with the overall average ratings regressors for both valence and arousal, respectively. Not only was each group’s ratings highly correlated with the overall average ratings regressors, but also highly correlated across groups for both valence (r’s from 0.86 to 0.92, p’s < 0.001) and arousal (r’s from 0.94 to 0.97, p’s < 0.001; see Fig. 3). Thus, although GAD patients had an average valence rating lower than other groups, variability in reported valence and arousal did not diﬀer across groups and patients with GAD, as well as  those in the other groups, had nearly perfect correlations with the overall ratings regressors (see above). Thus, our video stimulus was eﬀective in eliciting dynamic aﬀective reactivity across individuals and groups. Based on the extremely high correlations with all groups (r’s≥0.94) and visual inspection of the dynamic ratings data, it is clear that all groups displayed the same general pattern of arousal and valence dynamics and thus the imaging analysis do not appear to be explained by the more negative mean ratings in GAD patients.  3.2. Dynamics eﬀects of valence  Valence ratings were associated with a widespread ﬂuctuation in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity (See Table 2), where increases in reported negative valence were associated with increased BOLD activity. Note this is a negative correlation between valence (1= negative to 9= positive) and BOLD activity and therefore represented by negative parameter estimates and t-values. As can be seen in Fig. 4, this pattern was most prominently observed in the DMN including the bilateral precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), posterior dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), anterior dmPFC, and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). As hypothesized, activity in emotion processing regions including bilateral amygdala, anterior insula (aINS), caudate, and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) also tracked dynamics in self-report valence. Valence ratings also correlated with activity in perceptual regions such as the visual cortex, superior temporal gyrus, anterior temporal pole, and the thalamus.  3.3. Dynamic eﬀects of arousal  Similar to valence, arousal ratings were extensively correlated with activity across the brain (See Fig. 4;Table 3) such that increases in arousal were coupled with increases in BOLD activity. Activity in similar regions including the amygdala, aINS, caudate, sgACC, precuneus, IPL, dmPFC, visual cortex, and thalamus all correlated with arousal. As can been seen in Fig. 4, visual cortical coupling with arousal was more diﬀuse than valence coupling. Additionally, dynamics in arousal ratings were coupled with activity in dorsal attention network structures including the frontal eye ﬁelds and posterior parietal cortex as well as midbrain/brainstem diﬀuse modulatory structures.  40  J.M.

Valence and arousal dynamics in anxiety and depression  Controls, compared to patients, displayed signiﬁcantly greater coupling between negative valence ratings and BOLD activity in emotion processing regions such as the amygdala and dorsolateral PFC. Furthermore, structures within the DMN such as precuneus, PCC, dmPFC, and IPL revealed greater coupling with negative valence ratings for controls compared to patients (Table 4). Note again that greater coupling is measured by negative parameter estimates as this is a negative relationship between valence (1= negative to 9= positive) and BOLD activity. As can be seen in Fig. 5, a majority of the regions showing group-related eﬀects display a pattern that seems to indicate that valence coupling was strongest for controls, weaker for GAD patients, weaker still for those with MDD, and weakest for comorbid GAD-MDD patients (see Table 5 for pairwise comparisons between groups). As displayed in Fig. 5, correlations between measures of symptom severity and coupling between negative valence and brain reactivity indicates that the symptom of anhedonia or emotional  41  J.M.

On the other hand, anhedonia did not correlate with the mean (r =−0.12, p=0.38) or standard deviation (r =0.09, p=0.52) of valence ratings. It should be noted however, that when only looking within patients the correlation between anterior dmPFC valence coupling and anhedonia was the only relationship to remain signiﬁcant (r =0.34, p=0.01), which suggests that the relationship between anhedonia and valence coupling in the other regions may be driven by group.2 Correlations with General Distress Depression, General Distress Anxiety, Anxious Arousal, and Worry can be seen in Supplementary Table 4.  2 Additional partial correlation analyses assessing the relationship between anhedonia and neural coupling of valence in the anterior dmPFC (r =0.48, p=0.00006), posterior dmPFC (r =0.34, p=0.005), IPL (left r =0.35, p=0.004; right r =0.33, p=0.006), dorsal PCC (r =0.34, p=0.005), ventral PCC (r =0.25, p=0.03), precuneus (r =0.25, p=0.03), dlPFC (r =0.26, p=0.03), and amygdala (r =0.32, p=0.008) remained signiﬁcant when including group and age as covariates, which would suggest that group is not driving the eﬀects.  Similar to valence, arousal coupling in the PCC, IPL, dmPFC, and dlPFC was stronger for controls relative to all patient groups (see Supplementary Fig. 1;Table 4; see Table 5 for pairwise comparisons). Symptoms of anhedonia again correlated with the degree of arousal coupling in the dorsal PCC (r =−0.33, p=0.006), dmPFC (r =−0.28, p=0.02), and dlPFC (r =−0.29, p=0.02) such that greater levels of anhedonia were associated with lower levels of coupling between experienced arousal and BOLD activity.3 Anhedonia did not correlate with the mean (r =−0.22, p=0.10) or standard deviation (r =0.08, p=0.54) of arousal ratings. Additional correlation results can be seen in Supplementary Table 4.  4. Discussion  During emotional episodes we found that dynamic rating of emotional valence and arousal were linked to ﬂuctuations in neural activity within a broad network of regions. Emotional processing areas and regions consistent with the default mode network (DMN) both tracked dynamic shifts in arousal and valence. Regions consistent with the dorsal attention network as well as midbrain diﬀuse modulatory centers and visual cortical regions speciﬁcally tracked arousal, while superior temporal regions speciﬁcally tracked valence. Relative to healthy individuals, patients with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and those comorbid for these disorders displayed activity in the amygdala that only weakly tracked changes in reported valence. A similar pattern of uncoupling in patients was observed within the DLPFC and DMN for dynamic shifts in arousal and valence. Uncoupling between brain activity and aﬀective content was observed in all patient groups; however, the extent of this uncoupling correlated with severity in the symptom of anhedonia or emotional numbing.  4.1. Brain-based tracking of valence and arousal  Here, we used the television show Lost as a complex audiovisual stimulus with dynamic shifts in aﬀective content to assess which brain regions correlate with these ﬂuctuations. A number of emotion processing regions including the amygdala were coupled with both arousal and valence. We observed correlations with arousal in the brainstem, which houses diﬀuse modulatory centers for dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. Similar to research on emotion-induced inter-subject synchronization of brain activity (Nummenmaa et al., 2012), the dorsal attention network and visual network were linked to shifts in arousal state. This arousal-related coupling makes intuitive sense as arousal is typically deﬁned by increases in attention and perceptual processing as well as the release of diﬀuse modulatory neurotransmitters. The amygdala is known to project to the diﬀuse modulatory centers (Davis and Whalen, 2001; Knight (Vuilleumier, 2005; Vuilleumier et al., 2004), and the prefrontal cortex (Amaral and Price, 1984; Carlson et al., 2014, 2013). These projections in turn have indirect eﬀects on DAN structures (Pourtois et al., 2013). Given these projections and given our coupling between arousal state and amygdala activity (Fig. 5), it appears that shifts in aﬀective arousal state may be linked to an amygdala mediated facilitation of perceptual and attentional processing.  et al., 2005), perceptual  cortices  The amygdala is also thought to be a critical structure for the detection of biological relevance (Sander et al., 2003) and the coding of value (Peck et al., 2013), which may explain the coupling with valence in the amygdala (Fig. 5).

Brain regions correlating with valence across groups are shown in blue (same as Fig. 3). In orange are regions in which patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and GAD-MDD comorbid individuals displayed weaker correlations with negative valence (Upper) compared to controls. Extracted parameter estimates indicate a trend across many, but not all, regions in which correlations were strongest in controls (greater negative parameter estimates), weaker in GAD, weaker still in MDD, and weakest (parameter estimates close to zero) in comorbid. It should be noted that not all comparisons reach statistical signiﬁcance, see Table 5 (Middle). Furthermore, the tracking of valence was inversely correlated with anhedonia suggesting that disrupted neural tracking (parameter estimates close to zero) of valence is associated with emotional numbing (Lower).

The amygdala evaluates the relevance and salience of sensory information (Sander et al., 2003; Zald, 2003) and likely contributes to aﬀective experience by interacting with neural systems associated with autonomic and behavioral action responses (Davis and Whalen, 2001; Knight et al., 2005), which may lead to the representation of these responses elsewhere in the brain. And by doing so, has an indirect inﬂuence on aﬀective experience. A likely locus for representations of amygdala mediated responses is the anterior insula (aINS). The right aINS has previously been implicated both in interoception of one’s physiological state (Craig, 2002; Critchley et al., 2004) and the experience of aﬀective “feelings” (Carlson et al., 2011; Singer et al., 2009) and these processes share an overlapping common substrate within the aINS (Zaki et al., 2012). The current results are consistent with the role of the right aINS in the response to and the representation of experienced aﬀect, especially negative aﬀect. In addition to emotion processing regions, default mode network (DMN) activity correlated with valence and arousal. This ﬁnding is in line with previous work demonstrating that inter-subject synchronization of DMN brain activity is associated with negative valence (Nummenmaa et al., 2012). The exact function of the DMN is currently  unknown and a topic of ongoing discussion (Buckner et al., 2008; Buckner and Carroll, 2007; Devlin and Poldrack, 2007; Raichle et al., 2001; Ralchle and Snyder, 2007). However, one purported role of the DMN is in self-referential processing (Buckner and Carroll, 2007; Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Northoﬀ and Bermpohl, 2004) and many regions within the DMN including the dmPFC, PCC/precuneus, and IPL have been implicated in a variety of self-referential and otherreferential processes (D'argembeau et al., 2005; Gusnard et al., 2001; Johnson et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2002; Moran et al., 2006; Northoﬀ et al., 2006; Whitﬁeld-Gabrieli et al., 2011). This role of the DMN is very much in line with the current results. That is, DMN coupling with arousal and valence may be related to participants’ awareness of their own aﬀective state (Ochsner et al., 2004) or the aﬀective state of the characters in the video (Zaki et al., 2009), especially during highly arousing scenes of negative valence. It is likely that during dynamic emotional processing a number of processes related to theory of mind, consideration of one’s own feelings, consideration of other’s feelings, and perspective taking all engage this network. In any case, we demonstrate that the DMN is robustly associated with the tracking of emotion within a dynamic fMRI task.  44  J.M. Carlson et al.

Compromised brain-based tracking of valence and arousal in anxiety and depression  On average, GAD patients rated the entire clip more negatively than all other groups, but no diﬀerences in arousal ratings were found. Although GAD patients rated the content of the episode more negatively, variability in arousal and valence ratings across all groups was comparable and all groups showed the same overall pattern of ratings throughout the episode (Fig. 3). Thus, patients did not seem to have a problem recognizing and reporting changes in aﬀective valence and arousal during dynamic emotional vision, although GAD patients had a lower (more negative) baseline. Given that prior work (Rottenberg et al., 2005, 2002) has shown that patients, especially those with MDD, have a blunted response to aﬀective video content, it is somewhat surprising that we did not ﬁnd these types of diﬀerences in our sample. This may, at least partly, be attributed to the fact that participants rated the scenes for valence and arousal while watching the video for a second time outside of the scanner. Watching the video for a second time may have sensitized, or desensitized, participants resulting in very similar ratings across groups. Thus, in our data, patients’ ability to report valence and arousal within a dynamic aﬀective environment did not deviate from healthy controls. Yet, all patients displayed a disruption in the tracking of valence and arousal within the DMN and emotion processing regions.  Within the DMN and emotion processing regions there appears to be a pattern where aﬀective coupling is strongest in controls, weaker in GAD, weaker still in MDD, and weakest in GAD-MDD comorbid individuals (See Table 5). This is particularly true for DMN structures. During valence tracking, pairwise comparisons revealed that GAD patients did not diﬀer from controls (although there was a trend level diﬀerence), but did diﬀer from GAD-MDD comorbid patients in the dorsal PCC and precuneus. On the other hand, MDD patients had signiﬁcantly weaker tracking than controls in these regions, but did not diﬀer from GAD or GAD-MDD comorbid individuals. A similar, although weaker, pattern was found in the ventral PCC, IPL, and anterior dmPFC. This pattern suggests that although tracking is  disrupted in pure cases of GAD and MDD, GAD-MDD comorbid individuals suﬀer from a greater disruption in the ability to track aﬀective cues within the environment. Thus, in the current study, it appears that abnormalities in brain-based emotion tracking are compounded in GAD-MDD comorbid individuals which may be attributed to the additional and overlapping symptoms associated with the GAD-MDD comorbidity. Future research should assess the degree to which other abnormal symptoms and behaviors are heightened in comorbid patient populations.  Across the DMN and emotion processing regions, coupling with valence and arousal was linked most strongly and consistently to the symptoms of depression and in particular anhedonia or emotional numbing (see Supplementary Table 4). Lower coupling between these brain regions and the aﬀective environment was associated with greater emotional numbing. Although patients did not display diﬃculties in reporting state-level ﬂuctuations in emotional content, their brain response was not synchronized with these state-level ﬂuctuations. The correlation between uncoupling of aﬀective ratings with brain regions and emotional numbing suggests that although acute reporting of emotion is unaﬀected, a more chronic condition of emotional disconnect seems to be aﬀected. The inability to update the emotional state of the brain on a moment-to-moment basis may lead to a chronic state of blunted aﬀect. These results are consistent with the emotion context insensitivity theory of depression (Bylsma et al., 2008; Rottenberg et al., 2005, 2002; Taylor-Clift et al., 2011) and numerous studies showing blunted behavioral (Pizzagalli et al., 2008, 2005) and neural reactivity (Knutson et al., 2008; Pizzagalli et al., 2009; Steele et al., 2007) to rewarding and positive stimuli in depression and in particular depressed patients with anhedonia (Foti et al., 2014; Keedwell et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2014; Wacker et al., 2009). Our results provide new evidence that the blunted aﬀective response in anhedonic depression is associated with compromised tracking of moment-to-moment aﬀect within a number of brain regions including the dmPFC.  In the typical brain, DMN activity was tightly linked to aﬀective content. Conversely, in the brains of individuals with anxiety and  45  J.M. Carlson et al.  Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 260 (2017) 37–48  depression the tracking of aﬀective content within the DMN was greatly reduced and, to a large extent, nonexistent—especially in patients with high symptoms of anhedonia. Prior research using resting-state fMRI has reported abnormal DMN activity in a number of mental illnesses (Whitﬁeld-Gabrieli and Ford, 2012) including anxiety (Zhao et al., 2007), depression (Greicius et al., 2007; Grimm et al., 2011), schizophrenia (Whitﬁeld-Gabrieli et al., 2009), autism (Cherkassky et al., 2006), and Alzheimer’s disease (Greicius et al., 2004). Hyperactive DMN functioning has been reported in patients with depression (Greicius et al., 2007) and has been linked to symptoms of depressive rumination (Hamilton et al., 2011), altered self-focus (Grimm et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012), and abnormal emotional image processing (Grimm et al., 2009). Yet, on the basis of this previous research it is unclear how altered DMN activity relates to abnormal brain-based tracking of dynamic emotional content in anxiety and depression. Our results add support to the DMN theory of depression, and suggest that DMN dysfunction in anxiety and depression is related to abnormal tracking of dynamic aﬀective content and emotional numbing.  Anxious and depressed individuals also had impaired tracking of aﬀective content, and in particular negative valence, within the amygdala and other emotion processing regions. Abnormalities in amygdala function have long been linked to anxiety (Etkin et al., 2004, 2009; Monk et al., 2008; Nitschke et al., 2009) and depression (Canli et al., 2004; Sheline et al., 2001; Siegle et al., 2007) where these disorders are typically associated with a hyperactive amygdala response. This hyperactivity is likely driving the uncoupling between the amygdala and ﬂuctuations in aﬀective content. That is, if the amygdala remains active despite ﬂuctuations in aﬀective content, it is uncoupled from the content of the external environment. In addition to the amygdala, emotion regulatory regions such as the DLPFC also displayed abnormal tracking of aﬀective state in anxious and depressed individuals. This may indicate a deﬁcit in automatic emotion regulation of negative aﬀect within dynamic environments. Although similar abnormalities have been reported in task-based studies of emotion regulation in GAD (Etkin et al., 2010), further research is needed to test this claim. Thus, amygdala – prefrontal regions associated with emotion reactivity and emotion regulation show patterns of disrupted tracking of dynamic aﬀective content in anxiety and depression.  4.3. Limitations  One potential limitation of our study was the use of post-scanner ratings of valence and arousal. Given that these ratings occurred outside of the scanner and required participants to re-watch the entire episode of Lost, it is possible that our ratings do not accurately represent participants’ emotional state within the scanner. An alternative approach would have been to split the episode into scenes in the scanner and have participants rate them immediately afterwards while still in the scanner. We opted not to use this approach as we wanted participants to naturally observe the episode without thinking about how it made them feel. That is, knowing that one is expected to rate their aﬀective state would require reﬂection (and associated brain activation) during the episode that would not otherwise occur. Therefore, although acquiring ratings in the scanner would likely produce more accurate ratings data, the additional cognitive demands of the ratings task may aﬀect the pattern of neural activity elicited by the aﬀective episode. In the current study we prioritized our neural measures; however, future research could include in-task ratings to potentially improve the accuracy of the ratings measures. Another limitation to consider is the lack of a behavioral diﬀerence between patient groups. As mentioned above, watching the episode for a second time may have resulted in less accurate ratings. In light of our null behavioral eﬀects, the observed diﬀerences in neural coupling with valence and arousal between patients and controls should be interpreted with caution. Another limitation of our study was the degree to which the aﬀective video used validly reproduces the experiences  encountered in everyday life. Yet, the episode was successful in eliciting dynamic changes in aﬀective state, which is reﬂective of the dynamic nature of emotional processing. In addition, the use of a complex multimodal audiovisual stimulus likely resulted in diﬀerences in contrast, color, volume, and other low-level features between neutral and emotional scenes. Thus, another important limitation to note, is that some of the observed eﬀects could have been driven by low-level sensory features that are confounded with emotion. Furthermore, it should be noted that our sample only contained female participants and our control sample was slightly younger than the patient sample (age was used as a covariate to help control for this diﬀerence). In addition, IQ was not recorded. Finally, although our sample of N =60 was suﬃciently powered to detect large eﬀect sizes, it was not large enough to detect smaller eﬀects. Thus, future research is needed to determine the extent to which these ﬁndings can be replicated in a larger sample and the degree to which they are generalizable to male populations when controlling for age and IQ.  4.4. 4. Conclusion  The typical brain displays a large-scale network correlating with aﬀective content across the DMN, emotional processing regions, the dorsal attention network, and visual perceptual regions. However, in the DMN a clear pattern emerges where aﬀective coupling is strongest in controls, weaker in generalized anxiety disorder patients, weaker still in pure cases of major depressive disorder, and weakest in individuals comorbid for anxiety and depression. We found that the severity in emotional numbing is correlated with the degree of uncoupling between neural activity and aﬀective content. The pattern of disruption observed in this study seems to suggest a progression of compromised brain-based aﬀective tracking from anxiety and depression to individuals that are comorbid with anxiety and depression.

The   way   people   react   to  social   exclusion   has   been   hypothesized   to   be   shaped through   chronic   exposure   to  peer  rejection.   This   functional   Magnetic   Resonance   Imaging   study   examined associations   between   chronic   peer   rejection   and   retaliatory   (i.e.   punishing)   and   prosocial   (i.e.   forgiving) reactions   to   social   exclusion   and   the  neural   processes   underlying   them.   Chronically   rejected   (n   =   19)   and stably   highly   accepted   adolescents   (n   =   27)   distributed   money   between   themselves   and   unknown   others   who   previously   included   or   excluded   them   in   a   virtual   ball-tossing   game   (Cyberball).   Decreasing   the excluders’   monetary   proﬁts   (i.e.,   punishment)   was  associated   with   increased   activity   in   the   ventral   striatum,  dorsolateral   prefrontal   cortex   (PFC)   and   parietal   cortex   in   both   groups.   Compared   to   stably   highly accepted   adolescents,   chronically   rejected   adolescents   exhibited   higher   activity   in   the   dorsal   striatum and   lateral   prefrontal   cortex   –  brain   regions   implicated   in   cognitive   control   –   when   they   refrained   from punishment   and   shared   their   money   equally   with   (i.e.  forgave)   the   excluders.   These   results   provide insights   into   processes   that   might   underlie   the  maintenance   of  peer   rejection   across   development,   such as  difﬁculties   controlling   the  urge   to   retaliate   after   exclusion.  ©  2016  The   Authors.

Introduction  From  infancy  to  old  age,  humans  have  a  fundamental  need to  form  and  maintain  lasting  positive  relationships  with  others (Baumeister  and  Leary,  1995).  Social  exclusion  frustrates  this  need and  can  lead  to  retaliation  toward  the  sources  of  exclusion  (Twenge et  al.,  2007),  but  may   also  lead  to  prosocial  responses  aimed  at reconnection;  both  toward  potential  new  sources  of  afﬁliation (Maner  et  al.,  2007)  as  well  as  the  peers  responsible  for  exclusion (Will  et  al.,  2015).  The  way  people  react  to  social  exclusion  has been  hypothesized  to  be  shaped  through  exposure  to  prolonged rejection  by  close  others,  such  as  parents  (Feldman  and  Downey, 1994),  or  peers  (London  et  al.,  2007).  Indeed,  children  and  adolescents  with  a  history  of  chronic  peer  rejection  become  increasingly more  likely  to  defensively  expect,  readily  perceive,  and  overreact  to social  rejection  (London  et  al.,  2007)  and  show  a  heightened  neural  reactivity  to  social  exclusion  (Will  et  al.,  2016).  Yet,  how  the  ∗ Corresponding  author  at:  Institute  of  Psychology,  Leiden  University,  Wassenaarseweg  52,  2333  AK,  Leiden,  The  Netherlands.  E-mail  address:  g.j.will@fsw.leidenuniv.nl  (G.-J.  Will).  neural  responses  underlying  behavioral  reactions  to  exclusion  vary as  a  function  of  a  history  of  chronic  peer  rejection  remains  to  be investigated.  Therefore,  we   examined  neural  processes  involved  in retaliatory  (i.e.  punishing)  and  prosocial  (i.e.  forgiving)  reactions  to social  exclusion  in  adolescents  with  a  history  of  chronic  peer  rejection  and  tested  how  they  differed  from  adolescents  with  a  history of  stable  high  levels  of  peer  acceptance.  Peer  rejection  reﬂects  the  collective  valence  of  negative  sentiments  in  a  group  toward  a  speciﬁc  individual  in  that  group,  which  is most  commonly  assessed  through  asking  group  members  who   they like  most  (positive)  and  who   they  like  least  (negative)  (Bukowski et  al.,  2000;  Coie  et  al.,  1982;  Newcomb  and  Bukowski,  1983).  Children  who  receive  many  negative  nominations  and  very  few  positive nominations  are  classiﬁed  as  rejected  and  develop  widespread impairments  in  daily  life,  ranging  from  conduct  problems  (Sturaro et  al.,  2011)  to  delinquency  (Kupersmidt  et  al.,  1995)  and  dropping out  of  school  (Hymel  et  al.,  1996).  Transactional  developmental models  posit  that  such  impairments  arise  out  of  a  sustained  pattern  of  reciprocal  interactions  between  peers  expressing  dislike toward  a  rejected  group  member  and  the  rejected  member’s  reactions  to  being  disliked  (Coie,  1990;  Sandstrom  and  Coie,  1999). −   deﬁned  as  excluding  someone  from  a  group  or Social  exclusion   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2016.05.004 1878-9293/©  2016  The  Authors.

Will  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  19  (2016)  288–297   289  − activity    is  one  of  the  most  common  methods  adolescents  use  to express  dislike  toward  rejected  peers  (Coie,  1990).  Transactional models  predict  that  adolescents  who  react  to  exclusion  with  retaliatory  vengeance  might  be  more  likely  to  elicit  further  rejection than  those  who  show  behavior  aimed  at  reconnecting  after  exclusion.  Preliminary  support  for  this  hypothesis  comes  from  studies showing  that  adolescents  with  a  rejected  status  report  using  more aggressive  coping  styles  in  response  to  social  exclusion  in  a  hypothetical  scenario  (Sandstrom,  2004).  Elucidating  the  neurocognitive mechanisms  underlying  behavioral  reactions  to  exclusion  can  further  our  understanding  why  some  adolescents  become  trapped  in a  vicious  cycle  of  chronic  rejection  and  exclusion.  Neuroimaging  studies  have  demonstrated  that  a  history  of  peer rejection  and  accompanying  intra-  and  interpersonal  vulnerability  factors  are  associated  with  enhanced  neural  responses  to  social exclusion  in  adolescence.  Activity  in  the  dorsal  Anterior  Cingulate  Cortex  (ACC)  –  a  region  involved  in  detecting  and  generating exclusion-related  distress  –  during  exclusion  is  enhanced  in  adolescents  who  were  chronically  rejected  by  peers  during  childhood (Will  et  al.,  2016),  who  spent  less  time  with  friends  (Masten et  al.,  2012),  and  those  who  anxiously  and  angrily  expect  exclusion (Masten  et  al.,  2009).  Extending  our  scope  to  the  neural  processes underlying  behavioral  reactions  to  social  exclusion,  and  how  they vary  as  a  function  of  exposure  to  peer  rejection,  can  increase  our understanding  of  the  processes  underlying  adolescents’  decisions to  seek  revenge  or  reconnection  after  exclusion.  Neural  processes  underlying  retaliatory  and  prosocial  reactions to  social  exclusion  have  proven  to  be  reliably  examined  by  giving people  the  opportunity  to  distribute  money  between  themselves and  those  who  previously  either  included  or  excluded  them  (i.e. the  includers  and  excluders  respectively).  People  selectively  punish  the  excluders  by  decreasing  their  monetary  outcomes  while treating  the  includers  fairly.  This  form  of  punishment  has  been  associated  with  increased  activity  in  the  pre-supplementary  motor  area (pre-SMA)/ACC  and  anterior  insula  (AI)  (Gunther  Moor  et  al.,  2012; Will  et  al.,  2015).  Refraining  from  punishment  and  acting  prosocial  toward  the  excluders  (i.e.  forgiveness)  through  sharing  a  sum of  money  equally  with  them  has  been  associated  with  increased activation  in  neural  circuitry  supporting  social  cognition  (i.e.,  the temporo-parietal  junction  [TPJ]  and  the  dorsomedial  prefrontal cortex  [dmPFC])  and  executive  control  (i.e.,  lateral  prefrontal  cortex [lPFC])  (Gunther  Moor  et  al.,  2012;  Will  et  al.,  2015).  Well-established  behavioral  and  cognitive  signatures  of  a rejected  (vs.  an  accepted)  status  inform  our  hypotheses  about how  neural  processes  underlying  behavioral  reactions  to  exclusion  vary  as  a  function  of  peer  status  history.  In  comparison  with their  accepted  classmates,  children  with  a  rejected  status  are  more likely  to  deal  with  interpersonal  anger  in  aggressive  ways  that  instigate  further  conﬂict  (Fabes  and  Eisenberg,  1992;  Rabiner  et  al., 1990).  Furthermore,  they  exhibit  deﬁcits  in  social  cognition  (e.g. less  sophisticated  perspective-taking  skills)  and  executive  control (e.g.  problems  in  impulse  control  and  emotion  regulation)  skills (Dodge  et  al.,  2003b;  Eisenberg  et  al.,  1997;  Fink  et  al.,  2014),  which have  been  shown  to  be  crucially  involved  in  refraining  from  punishment  and  forgiving  excluders.  To  be  speciﬁc,  lower  levels  of behavioral  control  are  associated  with  higher  levels  of  aggression toward  excluders  (Chester  et  al.,  2013)  and  higher  levels  of  perspective  taking  are  associated  with  higher  levels  of  forgiveness  in  the form  of  refraining  from  punishment  and  sharing  a  sum  of  money with  excluders  (Will  et  al.,  2015).  Based  on  these  ﬁndings,  we hypothesized  that  chronically  rejected  adolescents  would  show:  1) higher  levels  of  punishment  (and  thus  lower  levels  of  forgiveness) toward  excluders;  2)  lower  levels  of  perspective-taking  and  higher levels  of  executive  control  problems  and  3)  differential  recruitment of  neural  circuitry  supporting  social  cognition  (e.g.  dmPFC  and  TPJ) and  executive  control  (e.g.  lPFC)  during  forgiveness.  To  test  these  hypotheses,  we   recruited  participants  whose acceptance  and  rejection  among  peers  was  assessed  annually across  six  elementary  school  grades  as  part  of  a  large-scale  longitudinal  study  (Sturaro  et  al.,  2011;  van  Lier  and  Koot,  2010). Using  strict  selection  criteria,  we  invited  a  group  of  adolescents who  were  chronically  rejected  by  peers  and  a  group  of  adolescents who  had  a  stable  accepted  status  among  peers  to  participate  in  the current  study.  While  undergoing  functional  Magnetic  Resonance Imaging  (fMRI),  they  were  ﬁrst  included  and  then  excluded  by  two unknown  adolescents  in  a  virtual  ball-tossing  game  called  Cyberball  (Williams  et  al.,  2000).  Subsequently,  they  played  an  economic game,  previously  validated  in  adults,  in  which  they  could  either punish  or  forgive  the  excluders  (Will  et  al.,  2015).  Results  on  the neural  correlates  of  exclusion  in  Cyberball  are  reported  elsewhere (see  Ref.  Will  et  al.,  2016).  We  anticipated  that  punishment  of  excluders  would  be  associated  with  increased  activity  in  the  pre-SMA/ACC  and  AI  (Sanfey et  al.,  2003;  Strobel  et  al.,  2011).  In  contrast,  forgiveness  was expected  to  be  associated  with  increased  activity  in  the  dmPFC, TPJ  and  lPFC  (Brüne  et  al.,  2013;  Will  et  al.,  2015).  With  respect to  individual  differences,  we  expected  that  adolescents  with  a  history  of  chronic  peer  rejection,  relative  to  adolescents  with  a  history of  stable  peer  acceptance,  would  show  enhanced  recruitment  of brain  regions  implicated  in  social  cognition  (e.g.  dmPFC,  TPJ)  and executive  control  (e.g.  lPFC)  during  forgiveness  of  excluders,  consistent  with  ﬁndings  demonstrating  that  adults  who  showed  less forgiveness  behavior  activated  these  networks  to  a  greater  extent when  they  did  decide  to  forgive  (Will  et  al.,  2015).  To  further explore  how  individual  differences  in  social  cognition  (i.e.  perspective  taking)  and  executive  control  (i.e.  behavioral  regulation) were  associated  with  punishment  and  forgiveness  behavior  and neural  activity  during  forgiveness,  we  tested  for  correlations  with self-reported  perspective-taking  and  parent-reported  behavioral regulation  skills.  2.  Material  and  methods  2.1.  Participants  and  recruitment  procedure  Participants  were  recruited  from  a  longitudinal  study  (N  =  1189) investigating  the  impact  of  social  experiences  on  behavioral,  emotional  and  academic  outcomes  between  the  ages  of  6  and  12 (annually  from  ﬁrst  to  sixth  grade  of  elementary  school).  Each  year, participants  were  asked  to  nominate  the  peers  in  their  class  whom they  liked  most  and  liked  least  (unlimited  nominations).  Using those  nominations,  an  average  social  preference  score  (liked  most –  liked  least  nominations)  across  the  six  waves  was  calculated.  Participants  were  identiﬁed  as  chronically  rejected  if  they  were  in  the lower  10th  percentile  of  that  6-year  average  social  preference  and as  stably  highly  accepted  if  they  were  in  the  upper  10th  percentile. Using  a  10%  threshold  insured  that  none  of  the  chronically  rejected adolescents  were  ever  classiﬁed  as  sociometrically  popular  and none  of  the  stably  highly  accepted  adolescents  were  ever  classiﬁed as  rejected  in  any  of  the  six  waves.  Correlations  between  social  preference  scores  of  adjacent  years  (rs  0.67–0.70,  all  ps  <  0.001)  were comparable  to  those  reported  in  prior  work  (Salmivalli  and  Isaacs, 2005;  Vitaro  et  al.,  2007).  Based  on  these  criteria,  suitability  for  participation  in  an  fMRI study  and  availability  of  recent  contact  information,  131  adolescents  were  asked  to  participate  in  the  fMRI  study.  Twenty adolescents  were  excluded  because  they  were  either  left-handed (n  =  4),  had  an  autism  spectrum  disorder  (n  =  1)  or  had  braces (n  =  15).  Seven  adolescents  could  not  be  reached.  Of  the  remaining  104  candidate  participants,  47  adolescents  and  their  parents agreed  to  participate  in  the  current  fMRI  study.  Adolescents  who  290   G.-J.  Will  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  19  (2016)  288–297  chose  not  to  participate  in  the  fMRI  study  (n  =  57)  did  not  differ  from those  who  did  participant  in  terms  of  average  social  preference,  age, or  gender  (all  ps  >  0.19).  All  participants   indicated  to  be  healthy  and  reported  no contraindications  for  MRI   (e.g.  no  head  injuries,  no  history  of  neurological  or  psychiatric  disorders),  except  for  four  participants with  a  history  of  rejection  who  were  diagnosed  with  AttentionDeﬁcit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD).  Of  those,  three  participants with  ADHD  were  on  a  stable  dose  of  methylphenidates,  but  were medication-free  on  the  day  of  scanning  and  the  preceding  day. A  radiologist  reviewed  all  anatomical  scans,  and  one  participant was  excluded  from  the  analyses  due  to  an  anomaly.  Three  participants  were  excluded  from  neuroimaging  analyses  because  their head  movement  exceeded  1  voxel  (3  mm)   in  at  least  one  direction. The  ﬁnal  sample  consisted  of  43  adolescents,  including  25  adolescents  with  a  history  of  stable  peer  acceptance  (M  [SD]  social preference  =  1.17  [0.18];  M  [SD]  age  =  14.0  [0.78];  13  males)  and  18 adolescents  with  a  history  of  chronic  peer  rejection  (M  [SD]  social −1.59  [0.52];  M  [SD]  age  =  14.1  [0.57];  13  males).  Stably preference  =  highly  accepted  and  chronically  rejected  adolescents  did  not  differ in  age,  pubertal  status,  gender,  race  or  IQ  (all  ps  >  0.12;  see  Table  1). This  study  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  ethical  standards  of  the  American  Psychological  Association  as  expressed  in the  Declaration  of  Helsinki.  All  participants  and  their  parents  gave informed  consent  for  the  study.  The  recruitment  procedure  was blind,  such  that  experimenters  were  not  informed  about  individual  participants’  peer  status  history.  Participants  and  their  parents were  not  informed  about  their  (child’s)  peer  status  history  and  were told  that  a  wide  range  of  participants  from  the  longitudinal  study was  invited  to  participate  in  the  fMRI  study.  Both  the  longitudinal study  and  the  fMRI  study  were  approved  by  the  medical  ethical committees  of  the  respective  universities.  2.2.  Experimental  procedure  Participants  were  ﬁrst  familiarized  with  the  scanner  environment  with  a  mock  scanner.  After  receiving  instructions, participants  carried  out  the  following  tasks  in  the  scanner:  (i) Cyberball  inclusion  with  two  anonymous  peers,  (ii)  Cyberball exclusion  by  two  novel  anonymous  peers,  and  (iii)  A  Dictator  game in  which  participants  distributed  money  between  themselves  and one  of  the  players  from  the  previous  Cyberball  games  (i.e.,  one  of the  includers  or  the  excluders;  see  Fig.  1A).  Participants  could  see the  stimuli  on  a  screen  located  at  the  head  of  the  scanner  bore  via a  mirror  mounted  on  the  head  coil.  Head  movement  was  restricted through  the  use  of  foam  inserts  inside  the  coil.  After  scanning,  participants  ﬁlled  out  a  battery  of  questionnaires  and  were  debriefed. Participants  received  a  monetary  compensation  for  participation and  small  gifts.  2.3.   fMRI  tasks  2.3.1.  Cyberball  but  further  excluded  the  participants  by  not  throwing  the  ball  to them  for  the  remainder  of  the  game  (28/30  throws).  2.3.2.  Dictator  game  Following  Cyberball,  participants  played  a  modiﬁed  Dictator Game  in  which  they  could  distribute  coins  between  themselves and  a  recipient  (Will  et  al.,  2015).  The  participants  were  instructed that  the  recipient  was   one  of  the  players  from  either  the  ﬁrst  or  the second  Cyberball  game  (i.e.,  Team  1  and  Team  2,  respectively).  It was  explained  that  they  would  encounter  all  four  players  from  both Cyberball  games  over  successive  rounds  of  the  Dictator  Game  and that  the  recipient  on  each  individual  trial  would  be  one  person  (e.g. one  player  from  team  2;  see  Fig.  1A).  To  ensure  that  the  participants were  aware  of  this  notion,  they  were  asked  during  which  of  the  two ball  game  they  encountered  the  players  on  each  team.  Participants were  told  that  the  coins  represented  real  money  and  that  their  decisions  determined  how  much  money  they  and  the  recipients  would receive  at  the  end  of  the  experiment.  In  reality,  each  participant received  the  same  ﬁxed  amount  of  money  as  compensation.  Participants  were  given  a  dichotomous  choice  to  either  share  an amount  of  money  equally  or  unequally  (see  Fig.  1B).  The  equal  distribution  (which  always  took  the  form  of  5  coins  for  self/5  for  the recipient)  was   pitted  against  an  unequal  alternative,  which  varied across  three  conditions:  (i)  beneﬁcial  inequality  (8  coins  for  the participant/2  for  the  recipient),  (ii)  non-costly  inequality  (5  coins for  the  participant/2  for  the  recipient),  (iii)  prosocial  inequality  (4 coins  for  the  participant/6  for  the  recipient).  In  line  with  previous  work  (Will  et  al.,  2015),  the  prosocial  inequality  condition  was added  as  a  ﬁller  condition.  By  including  a  ﬁller  condition  in  which the  unequal  option  increased  the  recipient’s  outcomes  (as  opposed to  decreasing  their  outcomes  in  the  punishment  conditions),  we aimed  to  prevent  automaticity  in  responding.  Behavioral  analyses  conﬁrmed  that  behavior  in  the  prosocial  inequality  condition was  indeed  unrelated  to  behavior  in  the  other  conditions  (see  Section  3.1).  Consequently,  the  prosocial  inequality  condition  was  not included  in  our  neuroimaging  analyses  of  the  neural  correlates  of punishment  and  forgiveness  (see  Section  2.7).  The  Dictator  Game  consisted  of  120  trials  (20  trials  per  condition;  3  inequality  conditions  x  2  recipients)  and  was  administered in  2  runs  of  207  vol  each,  lasting  about  15  min   in  total.  After  a  screen with  ﬁxation  cross  which  had  a  jittered  duration  (M  =  1540  ms; SD  =  1083  ms;   min   =  550  ms;   max   =  4950  ms;   optimized  with  OptSeq2;  Dale,  1999),  participants  were  presented  with  a  decision screen  that  showed:  (i)  the  two  distributions  they  could  choose from  and  (ii)  whether  the  recipient  was  a  player  from  Team  1  (i.e. an  includer)  or  Team  2  (i.e.  an  excluder)  (see  Fig.  1A).  Participants could  choose  one  of  two  distributions  of  money  by  pressing  a  button with  the  index  or  middle  ﬁnger  of  their  right  hand.  After  a  button was  pressed,  a  red  rectangle  appeared  around  the  chosen  distribution  until  6  s  after  trial  onset.  Failing  to  respond  within  5  s  resulted in  the  presentation  of  a  screen  with  “Too  late!”  with  the  duration of  1  s.  Trials  without  a  response  consisted  of  less  than  1%  of  all  trials and  were  excluded  from  further  analyses.  Participants  played  two  rounds  of  a  virtual  ball-tossing  game called  Cyberball  (Williams  et  al.,  2000).  Participants  were  led  to believe  that  the  other  players  in  the  game  were  other  participants in  the  experiment  who  were  connected  with  them  via  the  Internet. In  reality,  the  other  players’  behavior  was  preprogrammed.  First, participants  played  Cyberball  with  two  unfamiliar  peers  (i.e.  the includers;  two  cartoon  ﬁgures  accompanied  by  a  girl’s  and  a  boy’s name)  who  included  them  in  a  game  where  each  player  received the  ball  an  equal  amount  of  times  (10/30  throws).  Subsequently, they  played  another  round  of  Cyberball  with  two  novel  unfamiliar players  (i.e.  the  excluders;  with  a  new  boy’s  and  a  new  girl’s  name) who  threw  the  ball  once  to  the  participants  at  the  start  of  the  game,  2.4.  Questionnaires  2.4.1.  Executive  control  To  assess  executive  control  the  participants’  parents  ﬁlled  out the  ‘Behavioral  regulation  index’  scale  of  the  ‘Behavior  Rating Inventory  of  Executive  Function’  questionnaire  (BRIEF;  Gioia  et  al., 2000;  Huizinga  and  Smidts,  2011).  The  Behavioral  regulation  index represents  the  ability  to  shift  cognitive  sets  and  to  modulate  behavior  and  emotions.  The  scale  comprises  of  three  subscales:  inhibition (the  capacity  to  suppress  impulses,  e.g.  “Blurts  things  out”),  shifting  (the  capacity  to  ﬂexibly  adjust  behavior  to  changing  demands of  a  given  situation,  e.g.  “Becomes  upset  by  new  situations”),  and  G.-J.

All  items  were  rated  on  a  scale consisting  of  1  (never),  2  (sometimes)  to  3  (often)  and  summed. Higher  scores  on  the  Behavioral  regulation  index  reﬂect  increased difﬁculty  with  behavioral  regulation.  2.4.2.  Perspective  taking  To  assess  the  capacity  to  adopt  another  person’s  point  of  view participants  ﬁlled  out  the  perspective-taking  subscale  of  the  Interpersonal  Reactivity  Index  (IRI;  Davis,  1983)  (e.g.,  “Before  criticizing somebody,  I  try  to  imagine  how  I  would  feel  if  I  were  in  their  place.”). All  items  were  rated  on  a  scale  from  1  (not  at  all)   to  5  (very  much) and  averaged  to  a  mean  score  of  trait  perspective-taking.  2.5.   fMRI  data  acquisition  Scans  were  acquired  using  a  3T  Philips  Achieva  MRI   system  at the  Leiden  University  Medical  Center.  After  obtaining  a  localizer scan,  T2*-weighted  Echo-Planar  Images  (EPI)  were  acquired  (repe× tition  time  (TR)  =  2.2  s,  echo  time  (TE)  =  30  ms,   slice  matrix  =  80    80 matrix,  slice  thickness  =  2.75  mm,   slice  gap  =  0.28  mm   gap,  ﬁeld  of × view  (FOV)  =  220    114.68  mm)   during  two  functional  runs of  207  vol  each.  The  ﬁrst  two  volumes  in  each  functional  run were  discarded  to  allow  for  equilibration  of  T1  saturation  effects. High-resolution  T1-weighted  and  T2-weighted  anatomical  scans × (TR  =  9.760  ms;   TE  =  4.59  ms,   140  slices,  0.875    1.2  mm ×   177  mm)   were  acquired  for voxels,  ﬁeld  of  view  =  224  anatomical  reference.  ×   0.875   ×   168   ×   220   2.6.   fMRI  data  analysis  MRI   data  were  preprocessed  and  analyzed  using  SPM8  statistical  parametric  mapping  image  analysis  software  (Wellcome Trust  Centre  for  Neuroimaging,  University  College  London).  Functional  images  were  slice-time  corrected,  realigned,  co-registered to  individual  structural  T1  scans,  normalized  to  a  T1  template,  and spatially  smoothed  using  an  8-mm  FWHM  Gaussian  ﬁlter.  The  normalization  algorithm,  resampled  the  volumes  to  3  mm  cubic  voxels using  a  12-parameter  afﬁne  transformation  and  a  nonlinear  transformation  involving  cosine  basic  functions.  All  results  are  reported in  MNI305  stereotactic  space.  A  ﬁrst-level  general  linear  model  was  deﬁned  for  each  participant’s  functional  run  that  included  a  boxcar  regressor  for  each epoch  of  interest  (e.g.,  decision  phase)  and  convolved  with  a  canonical  hemodynamic  response  function  (HRF).  The  duration  of  epochs in  which  participants  submitted  a  response  was   modeled  using the  participant’s  reaction  time.  Regressors  were  deﬁned  separately  for  choosing  equal  and  unequal  distributions  in  each  of  the three  inequality  conditions  and  analyzed  separately  for  includers and  excluders.  This  model  consisted  of  12  decision-related  regressors  (i.e.,  inequality  condition  [3]  x  recipient  [2]  x  choice  [2]),  a  regressor  indicating  missed  trials,  and  a  covariate  for  each  run  to control  for  run  effects  (3),  resulting  in  a  General  Linear  Model  (GLM) with  a  total  of  16  predictors  and  contained  a  basic  set  of  cosine  functions  that  high-pass-ﬁltered  the  data.  The  least-squares  parameter estimates  of  the  height  of  the  best-ﬁtting  canonical  HRF   for  each condition  separately  were  used  in  pair-wise  contrasts  at  the  subject level.  There  was  no  minimum  amount  of  trials  for  the  decisionrelated  regressors.  The  resulting  contrast  images  were  submitted  to group  analyses  where  participants  were  treated  as  a  random  effect. Subsequently,  we  performed  one-tailed  t-tests  of  which  results were  considered  signiﬁcant  at  an  uncorrected  threshold  of  p  <  0.001 with  a  minimum  cluster  size  of  10  contiguous  voxels  to  balance between  Type  1  and  Type  2  errors  (Lieberman  and  Cunningham, 2009).  We   also  report  which  clusters  are  signiﬁcant  using  Family wise  Error  (FWE)  cluster-correction  at  p  <  0.05  with  a  cluster  forming  threshold  of  p  <  0.001.  We   used  the  Marsbar  toolbox  (Brett  et  al., 2002;  http://marsbar.sourceforce.net/)  to  extract  and  plot  activity  in  functional  regions  of  interest  derived  from  the  whole-brain contrasts.  2.7.  Operationalization  of  constructs  and  plan  of  analyses  Punishment  and  its  counterpart  forgiveness  are  both  behavioral reactions  to  an  offense  or  a  violation  of  a  social  norm  (McCullough et  al.,  1997).  Consequently,  punishment  and  forgiveness  can  only take  place  in  interactions  with  the  excluders.  To  get  a  clean  measure of  punishment/forgiveness  baseline  preferences  for  equality  have to  be  accounted  for.  Therefore,  punishment  was  operationalized as  unequal  treatment  of  excluders  (i.e.  decreasing  the  recipient’s monetary  outcomes)  while  controlling  for  baseline  treatment  of includers  (difference  score:  excluders  unequal–includers  unequal treatment)  in  both  our  behavioral  and  neuroimaging  analyses  (see Fig.  1C).  Consistent  with  prior  work  (Brüne  et  al.,  2013;  McCullough et  al.,  1997;  van  der  Wal   et  al.,  2014;  Will  et  al.,  2015),  forgiveness  was   operationalized  as  refraining  from  punishment  and  acting prosocial  toward  the  offenders  (i.e.  excluders),  i.e.  equal  treatment of  excluders  while  controlling  for  baseline  fairness  preferences. Importantly,  only  treatment  in  the  beneﬁcial  inequality  and  noncostly  inequality  conditions  was  used  for  these  analyses,  because the  prosocial  inequality  condition  does  not  offer  participants  the opportunity  to  punish  (because  excluders’  outcomes  could  not  be reduced)  neither  to  forgive  (since  there  is  no  possibility  to  refrain from  punishment)  (Will  et  al.,  2015).  To  substantiate  these  conceptual  considerations  by  our  data,  we  examined  allocation  behavior toward  includers  and  excluders  in  all  conditions  and  subsequently tested  the  hypothesized  correlations  between  treatment  of  includers  and  excluders  in  each  of  the  conditions  separately.  To  insure that  group  differences  in  BOLD  responses  could  not  be  explained by  differences  in  reaction  times,  we  also  tested  for  differences  in reaction  times  between  groups  and  conditions.  292   G.-J.  Will  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  19  (2016)  288–297  Fig.  1.  (A)  Experimental  procedure:  Participants  carried  out  the  following  tasks  in  the  scanner:  (i)  Cyberball  inclusion  with  two  anonymous  peers  (includers;  green),  (ii) Cyberball  exclusion  by  two  novel  anonymous  peers  (excluders;  red),  and  (iii)  Dictator  game  in  which  participants  distributed  money  between  themselves  (depicted  with red   coins)  and  the  players  from  the  Cyberball  games  (i.e.,  includers  and  excluders;  depicted  with  blue  coins).  (B)  In  every  trial,  participants  were  given  a  dichotomous choice  between  either  an  equal  distribution  of  money  and  an  unequal  distribution,  of  which  the  latter  varied  depending  on  the  inequality  condition.  (C)  Punishment  was operationalized  as  the  difference  between  unequal  treatment  of  excluders  –  unequal  treatment  of  includers  in  the  punishment  (i.e.  beneﬁcial  inequality  and  non-costly inequality)  conditions.  Given  that  our  conceptual  operationalization  of  punishment  and forgiveness  was  supported  by  the  data  (see  analysis  of  behavioral results:  3.1),  we  collapsed  across  beneﬁcial  and  non-costly  punishment  choices  for  our  neuroimaging  analyses  to  increase  power. To  examine  the  neural  correlates  of  punishment,  we  contrasted unequal  treatment  of  excluders  in  the  beneﬁcial  inequality  and non-costly  inequality  condition  with  unequal  treatment  in  those conditions  for  includers  (Unequal  treatment  excluders  >  Unequal treatment  includers;  median  amount  of  trials  unequal  treatment excluders  =  30;  range  =  3–40;  median  amount  of  trials  unequal treatment  includers  =  13;  range  =  1–40).  To  examine  the  neural  correlates  of  forgiveness,  we  contrasted  equal  treatment  of  excluders  in  the  beneﬁcial  inequality  and  non-costly  inequality  condition with  equal  treatment  in  those  conditions  for  includers  (Equal treatment  excluders  >  Equal  treatment  includers;  median  amount of  trials  equal  treatment  excluders  =  11;  range  =  1–39;  median amount  of  trials  equal  treatment  includers  =  33;  range  =  1–40).  For completeness,  we   contrasted  unequal  treatment  of  excluders  in  the beneﬁcial  inequality  and  non-costly  inequality  condition  with  equal treatment  in  those  conditions  for  includers  (Unequal  treatment excluders  >  Equal  treatment  includers).  For  group  comparisons, contrast  images  were  entered  into  separate  second-level  analyses  G.-J.  Will  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  19  (2016)  288–297   293  the  decision  to  collapse  choices  in  the  beneﬁcial  inequality  and non-costly  inequality  conditions  for  our  neuroimaging  analyses  of punishment  and  forgiveness,  and  (iii)  the  decision  to  exclude  the prosocial  inequality  condition  from  our  neuroimaging  analyses  of punishment  and  forgiveness.  Chronically  rejected  adolescents   (M  =  44.8;  SEM  =  2.8)  had more  parent-reported  behavioral  regulation  difﬁculties  than  sta−3.32, bly  highly  accepted  adolescents  (M  =  34.8;  SEM  =  1.1),  t  =  p  =  0.003,  also  after  controlling  for  gender  and  ADHD  diagnosis.  Self-reported  perspective-taking  skills  did  not  differ  between groups  (p  =  0.108).  Punishment  behavior  (beneﬁcial  and  non-costly unequal  treatment  of  excluders  –  includers)  was   not  correlated with  behavioral  regulation  difﬁculties  (p  =  0.393)  or  perspective taking  (p  =  0.190).  To   investigate  reaction  time  differences,  we   performed  a repeated-measures  ANOVA  with  recipient  (2  levels:  includers  vs. excluders)  and  inequality  condition  (3  levels:  beneﬁcial  inequality, non-costly  inequality  and  prosocial  inequality)  as  within-subjects factors  and  peer  status  history  (2  levels:  chronically  rejected  vs. stably  highly  accepted)  as  a  between-subjects  factor  and  reaction  times  as  the  dependent  variable.  This  analysis  yielded  a  main ␩p2 =  0.23, effect  of  inequality  condition,  F(2,  82)  =  12.47,  p  <  0.001,  but  no  further  signiﬁcant  main  or  interaction  effects,  all  Fs  <  2.46, ␩p2s  <  0.058.  Follow-up  pairwise  comparisons  showed ps  >  0.10,  that  reaction  times  were  faster  in  the  Beneﬁcial  Inequality  condition  (M  =  1591  ms;   SEM  =  69  ms)   than  in  Non-costly  Inequality (M  =  1744  ms;  SEM  =  76)  and  Prosocial  Inequality  (M  =  1798  ms; SEM  =  74)  conditions  (both  ps  <  0.018),  and  the  latter  two  conditions did  not  differ  from  each  other,  p  =  0.206.  3.2.  Neuroimaging  results  3.2.1.   fMRI  results:  punishment  and  forgiveness  across  the  sample  Before  we  examined  differences  in  brain  responses  between chronically  rejected  and  stably  highly  accepted  adolescents,  we   ﬁrst investigated  the  neural  correlates  of  punishment  and  forgiveness across  the  sample.  The  punishment  contrast  (Unequal  treatment excluders  >  Unequal  treatment  includers)  resulted  in  activation  in −12,  20,  7  and  9,  20,  4),  right bilateral  ventral  striatum  (peaks  at  −58, dlPFC  (36,  29,  37)  and  bilateral  parietal  cortex  (peaks  at  30,  −45,  52)  (Fig.  3A).  The  forgiveness  contrast  (Equal 61  and  treatment  excluders  >  Equal  treatment  includers)  contrast  resulted in  activation  in  the  dmPFC  (peak  at  6,  47,  22;  Fig.  3B).  Alternative  punishment  (Unequal  treatment  excluders  >  Equal  treatment excluders)  and  forgiveness  (Equal  treatment  excluders  >  Unequal treatment  excluders)  contrasts  did  not  result  in  signiﬁcant  clusters of  activation  at  our  chosen  threshold.  All  signiﬁcant  clusters  are reported  in  Table  2.  −45,   3.2.2.  Individual  differences  associated  with  chronic  peer  group rejection,  perspective-taking  skills  and  behavioral  regulation problems  To  examine  how  neural  processes  involved  in  punishment  and forgiveness  of  exclusion  varied  as  a  function  of  chronic  peer  rejection,  we   compared  the  two   groups  using  two-sample  t-tests  on both  contrasts  outlined  above.  A  two-sample  t-tests  on  the  punishment  contrast  (Unequal  treatment  excluders  >  Unequal  treatment includers)  showed  that  chronically  rejected  and  stably  highly accepted  adolescents  showed  no  differential  brain  activity  during punishment  of  excluders.  During  forgiveness  of  excluders,  chronically  rejected  adolescents  showed  enhanced  activity  in  lPFC  (peak at  36,  44,  4)  and  dorsal  striatum  (peak  at  9,  11,  10)  when  directly compared  to  stably  rejected  adolescents  in  a  two-sample  t-tests  on the  forgiveness  contrast  (Equal  treatment  excluders  >  Equal  treatment  includers).  As  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  4,  the  group  differences  are driven  by  heightened  lPFC  and  dorsal  striatum  responses  during  Fig.  2.

To  explore  individual differences,  we  ran  two  whole-brain  regression  analyses  on  the forgiveness  contrast  (Equal  treatment  excluders  >  Equal  treatment includers)  with  self-reported  trait  perspective-taking  or  parentreported  behavioral  regulation  problems  as  predictors.  Both  for behavioral  and  neuroimaging  analyses,  we  ran  analyses  in  the  following  order:  i)  main  effects  across  the  sample,  ii)  peer  status history  group  differences,  and  iii)  individual  differences  associated with  perspective-taking  and  executive  control.  3.  Results  3.1.  Behavioral  results:  punishment  and  forgiveness  inequality  and  prosocial   First,  we  examined  allocation  behavior  toward  includers  and excluders  in  all  conditions.  We   performed  a  repeated  measures  ANOVA  with  recipient  (2  levels:  includers  vs.  excluders) and  inequality  condition  (3  levels:  beneﬁcial  inequality,  noninequality)  as  within-subjects costly  factors  and  peer  status  history  (2  levels:  chronically  rejected  vs. stably  highly  accepted)  as  a  between-subjects  factor  for  the  percentage  of  unequal  distributions  chosen  in  the  Dictator  Game. This  analysis  yielded  main  effects  of  recipient,  F(1,  41)  =  30.37, ␩p2 =  0.43,  inequality  condition,  F(2,  82)  =  35.90,  p  <  0.001, p  <  0.001,  ␩p2 =  0.47,  and  a  recipient  x  inequality  condition  interaction,  F(2, ␩p2 =  0.46.  Participants  chose  the  unequal  dis82)  =  34.62,  p  <  0.001,  tribution  more  often  for  the  excluders  than  for  the  includers  in  the beneﬁcial  and  non-costly  inequality  conditions  (both  ps  <  0.001; see  Fig.  2).  In  contrast,  they  chose  the  unequal  distribution  more often  for  the  includers  than  for  excluders  in  the  prosocial  inequality  condition  (p  =  0.031).  Neither  interaction  effects  with  peer  status history  or  a  main  effect  of  peer  status  history  were  found.  Thus,  both stably  highly  accepted  and  chronically  rejected  adolescents  punished  the  excluders  by  choosing  unequal  distributions  of  money for  the  excluders  and  they  did  this  to  a  similar  extent.  Beneﬁcial  punishment  (beneﬁcial  inequality  excluders  –  beneﬁcial  inequality  includers)  and  non-costly  punishment  (non-costly inequality  excluders  –  non-costly  inequality  includers)  were  highly correlated  (r  =  0.81,  p  <  0.001)  and  did  not  differ  from  another −1.18,  p  =  0.245).  Behavior  in  the  prosocial  inequality  condition (t  =  was  unrelated  to  behavior  in  the  other  inequality  conditions,  both for  includers  (both  rs  <  0.12,  both  ps  >  0.447)  and  for  excluders  (both rs  <  0.11,  both  ps  >  0.513).

To  explore  how  individual  differences  in  perspective  taking and  executive  control  were  associated  with  neural  activity  during  forgiveness,  we  ran  two  whole-brain  regression  analyses  on the  forgiveness  contrast  (Equal  treatment  excluders  >  Equal  treat ment  includers)  with  self-reported  trait  perspective-taking  skills or  parent-reported  behavioral  regulation  problems  as  predictors.

Discussion  This  study  examined  the  neural  processes  involved  in  punishment  and  forgiveness  of  excluders  and  how  these  processes  vary  as a  function  of  chronic  peer  rejection.  The  ﬁrst  main  ﬁnding  was   that both  chronically  rejected  and  stably  highly  accepted  adolescents punished  the  excluders  by  selectively  decreasing  their  monetary outcomes;  both  when  punishment  resulted  in  gains  and  when  punishment  had  no  monetary  beneﬁts.  Social  exclusion  thus  elicits  a tendency  to  retaliate  against  the  sources  of  exclusion  even  when this  does  not  result  in  material  gain,  which  is  not  modulated  by  a history  of  chronic  peer  rejection.  The  second  main  ﬁnding  was  that  punishment  was   associated with  heightened  activity  in  the  striatum,  the  dlPFC  and  parietal  cortex  in  both  groups  of  adolescents.  The  striatum  has  previously  been shown  to  be  involved  in  processing  both  primary  (e.g.  food)  and social  rewards,  including  punishment  of  unfair  interaction  partners  (Singer  et  al.,  2006).  Furthermore,  striatum  activation  during punishment  has  been  shown  to  correlate  with  the  self-reported desire  for  revenge  and  has  therefore  been  suggested  to  code  for  the rewarding  aspect  of  retaliation.  Activation  in  the  dlPFC  has  been linked  to  punishing  criminal  intent  (Buckholtz  et  al.,  2008)  and economic  unfairness  (Güro˘glu  et  al.,  2011).  The  dlPFC  –  in  concert with  the  parietal  cortex  –  has  been  proposed  to  integrate  different value  signals  and  execute  a  punishment  response  among  competing  response  options  (Buckholtz  and  Marois,  2012).  Contrary  to  our  hypotheses,  chronically  rejected  adolescents  did not  show  lower  levels  of  forgiveness  than  stably  highly  accepted adolescents.  Nonetheless,  despite  both  groups  displaying  similar levels  of  forgiveness  behavior,  meaningful  differences  emerged  on a  neural  level.  To  be  speciﬁc,  the  third  main  ﬁnding  was  that  chronically  rejected  adolescents,  compared  to  stably  highly  accepted adolescents,  displayed  higher  levels  of  activity  in  the  dorsal  striatum  and  the  lPFC  when  they  forgave  the  excluders.  The  dorsal striatum  is  strongly  connected  with  a  dorsal  fronto-parietal  network  that  plays  a  vital  role  executive  control  (Haber  and  Knutson, 2010;  van  den  Bos  et  al.,  2014).  Together  with  the  chronically rejected  adolescents’  higher  levels  of  behavioral  regulation  difﬁculties  (indexing  problems  in  inhibition,  shifting  and  emotional control),  heightened  activity  in  this  dorsal  fronto-striatal  network suggests  that  chronically  rejected  adolescents  have  to  exert  greater levels  of  control  in  order  to  act  prosocial  toward  those  who  previously  excluded  them.  This  dovetails  with  ﬁndings  showing  that when  children  are  asked  to  react  to  a  peer  hassle  under  time pressure,  those  with  a  rejected  status  generate  more  aggressive reactions  than  children  with  an  accepted  status  (Rabiner  et  al.,  Fig.  4.  Chronically  rejected  adolescents  showed  enhanced  activity  in  lPFC  (peak  at 36,   44,  4)  and  dorsal  striatum  (peak  at  9,  11,  10)  compared  to  stably  highly  accepted adolescents  during  forgiveness  of  excluders.  Subject-level  contrast  values  in  both regions  were  extracted  for  trials  where  participants  shared  equally  with  the  includers  and  excluders  to  facilitate  interpretation  (error  bars  represent  standard  errors of   the  mean).  Fig.  5.  (A)  A  whole  brain  regression  analysis  on  the  forgiveness  contrast  with self-reported  perspective-taking  skills  as  a  predictor  resulted  in  activation  in  an −3,  50,  37);  (B)  A  whole  brain  regression  analyoverlapping  region  of  dmPFC  (peak  at  sis   on  the  forgiveness  contrast  with  parent-reported  behavioral  regulation  problems as  a  predictor  resulted  in  activation  in  the  pre-SMA/ACC  (peak  at  3,  11,  55)  and  in the   right  dorsal  AI  (peak  at  37,  17,  10).  C.V.  =  contrast  value.  296   G.-J.  Will  et  al.  /  Developmental  Cognitive  Neuroscience  19  (2016)  288–297  1990),  consistent  with  their  higher  levels  of  aggressive  behavior in  daily  life  (Dodge  et  al.,  2003a;  Ladd,  2006).  However,  when  they were  given  enough  time  to  think  about  their  reactions,  the  reactions of  most  children  with  a  rejected  status  became  indistinguishable from  their  peers  with  an  accepted  status.  Taken  together,  a  greater demand  on  neural  circuitry  implicated  in  cognitive  control  during prosocial  reactions  to  exclusion  could  be  a  correlate  of  these  reactions  being  more  effortful  for  adolescents  who  were  chronically rejected.  The  fourth  main  ﬁnding  was  that  analyses  of  individual  differences  yielded  insights  into  processes  underlying  refraining  from retaliation.  Two  mechanisms  have  been  shown  to  be  involved in  succeeding  or  failing  to  refrain  from  retaliation  after  being excluded:  i)  the  ability  to  take  other  people’s  perspectives  (Will et  al.,  2015)  and  ii)  the  ability  to  cognitively  control  behavior (Chester  et  al.,  2013).  Our  ﬁndings  show  that  these  two  mechanisms are  associated  with  activity  in  functionally  separable  neural  networks.  That  is,  during  forgiveness,  perspective-taking  skills  scaled with  activity  in  the  dmPFC,  which  is  a  hub  in  the  ‘theory  of  mind’ network  (Koster-Hale  and  Saxe,  2013)  and  behavioral  regulation problems  correlated  positively  with  activity  in  the  pre-SMA/ACC and  dorsal  AI.  A  meta-analysis  has  shown  that  the  dorsal  AI  (overlapping  with  the  cluster  in  our  study)  is  strongly  connected  to  the pre-SMA/ACC  and  dlPFC  and  is  implicated  in  executive  control  functions,  including  inhibition  and  switching  (Chang  et  al.,  2013).  Taken together,  these  ﬁndings  show  that  individual  differences  in  cognitive  functions  can  be  reliably  linked  to  activity  in  functionally separable  neural  networks  supporting  social  cognition  (e.g.  dmPFC) or  executive  control  (e.g.  ACC  and  dorsal  AI)  and  they  underscore the  importance  of  examining  individual  differences  in  neural  processes  underlying  prosocial  reactions  to  social  exclusion.  Several  limitations  of  this  study  deserve  to  be  mentioned.  First, the  data  do  not  speak  to  the  causal  question  whether  observed differences  in  forgiveness-related  neural  activity  were  caused  by chronic  peer  rejection,  or  whether  they  reﬂect  a  propensity  that was  already  present  before  the  emergence  of  a  rejected  peer  status.  High  levels  of  behavioral  problems  are  known  to  predict  peer rejection  and  peer  rejection  in  turn  is  known  to  predict  increases in  behavioral  problems  above  and  beyond  prior  levels  of  problem behavior  (Sturaro  et  al.,  2011).  The  observed  differences  in  neural processing  between  the  two  groups  may   thus  reﬂect:  1)  a  predisposition  that  was  already  present  before  the  emergence  of  a  rejected peer  status,  2)  a  result  of  chronic  peer  rejection  or  3)  a  combination of  both.  Longitudinal  studies  with  multiple  MRI   scans  and  classroom  assessments  of  peer  rejection  at  different  time-points  across development  are  needed  to  better  understand  the  nature  of  the relationship  between  brain  development  and  chronic  peer  rejection.  Second,  differences  between  the  two  groups  could  both  be the  result  of  greater  exposure  to  negative  peer  interactions  in  the rejected  group  or  greater  exposure  to  positive  peer  interactions  in the  accepted  group.  Future  studies  should  compare  rejected  adolescents  to  adolescents  with  a  so-called  ‘average’  social  status  to disentangle  the  inﬂuence  of  positive  and  negative  experiences  in the  peer  group  on  neural  processing  involved  in  social  behavior. Third,  our  sample  of  chronically  rejected  adolescents  was   relatively small.  Rejected  adolescents  form  a  heterogeneous  group  consisting  of  aggressive  and  non-aggressive  subtypes  (Ladd,  2006).  Future research  with  larger  samples  could  test  whether  the  absence  of behavioral  differences  between  the  two  groups  in  our  study  could be  due  to  heterogeneity  in  the  rejected  group.  Fourth,  we   did  not collect  self-reports  of  trait  forgiveness  to  validate  our  behavioral measure  of  forgiveness.  Nonetheless,  other  studies  have  validated this  behavioral  measure  of  forgiveness  by  showing  that  sharing valuable  resources  with  an  offender  in  the  Dictator  Game  correlates  with  self-reports  of  trait  forgiveness  (van  der  Wal   et  al., 2014).  Moreover,  our  index  of  forgiveness  comprises  (at  least)  two  components  that  are  central  to  forgiveness:  i)  refraining  from  punishment  and  ii)  a  prosocial  concern  for  the  offender’s  well  being. Nonetheless,  cautiousness  is  warranted  in  drawing  ﬁrm  conclusions  about  the  extent  to  which  our  behavioral  measure  reﬂects the  multi-faceted  construct  that  is  forgiveness.  5.  Conclusions  Our  results  show  that  punishment  and  forgiveness  of  excluders  rely  on  distinct  neural  networks  implicated  in  emotional  and cognitive  processes  involved  in  social  decision-making.  Although chronically  rejected  adolescents  were  equally  likely  to  forgive excluders  as  stably  highly  accepted  adolescents,  they  displayed enhanced  recruitment  of  the  dorsal  striatum  and  lPFC  when  forgiving  excluders,  suggesting  that  they  might  have  to  exert  greater levels  of  executive  control  in  order  act  prosocial  toward  peers who  excluded  them.  Consequently,  our  results  have  implications for  understanding  the  processes  through  which  peer  rejection’s adverse  effects  are  transmitted  across  development.  A  greater  demand  on  executive  control  functions  might  entail greater  difﬁculties  controlling  retaliatory  responses  to  negative treatment  in  the  heat  of  the  moment  of  everyday  interactions  with peers.  In  turn,  retaliatory  responses  are  likely  to  provoke  excluders, which  could  elicit  new  episodes  of  exclusion  and  thereby  further consolidate  a  rejected  status  in  the  peer  group  (Sandstrom,  2004).  A priority  for  future  research  is  therefore  to  further  examine  longitudinal  associations  between  behavioral  reactions  to  social  exclusion, peer  status,  and  different  subcomponents  of  cognitive  control  (e.g. inhibition,  shifting,  emotion  regulation  tasks)  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  which  executive  functions  might  underlie  prosocial reactions  to  exclusion.  Such  endeavors  can  inform  research  that could  test  whether  training  of  executive  functions  might  facilitate adaptive  social  responses  to  exclusion,  which  ultimately  could  lead to  greater  acceptance  among  peers.

Our ﬁndings in twenty healthy male subjects demonstrate that (1) word valence has no impact on performance in the verbal working memory task, and (2) that emotion leads to an increase of activation in cognition-related lateral prefrontal regions, whereas cognitive effort yields enhanced deactivation in emotion-related cortical midline regions. The stronger dorsolateral prefrontal recruitment during emotional stimuli may reﬂect an arousal effect or higher cognitive effort due to interference with emotion.  © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Article history: Accepted 3 April 2012 Available online 12 April 2012  Keywords: Verbal working memory Valence Arousal Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex Cortical midline regions  Introduction  There are numerous experiences in our everyday life showing that information and situations associated with emotions are better remembered. While an emotional enhancement effect on episodic memory performance has been shown in several studies at the behavioral as well as at the neural level (Buchanan and Adolphs, 2003; Kensinger and Corkin, 2003; Smith et al., 2005), less is known about the relation between emotion and working memory (WM).  WM is an essential component of many cognitive operations, from complex decision making to selective attention (Baddeley, 1986). One commonly utilized WM task is the n-back task, which requires participants to monitor a series of stimuli and to respond whenever a stimulus is presented that is the same as the one presented n trials previously. The task requires subjects to continually adjust the information held in working memory, to incorporate the most recently presented stimulus while simultaneously rejecting or ignoring more temporally distant stimuli. N-back tasks have been used to demonstrate that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is implicated in numerous cognitive functions relevant to WM, including holding to-be-remembered information online (Goldman-Rakic, 1994; Jonides et al., 1993), monitoring and manipulating the to-be-remembered information (Petrides, 1994), response selection (Rowe et al., 2000), and implementation of strategies to facilitate memory (Bor et al., 2003, 2004). Activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during n-back tasks is often described in relation to increased effort, complexity, or attention (Botvinick et al., 2004; Duncan  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Cluster of Excellence “Languages of Emotion”, Freie  Universitaet Berlin, Habelschwerdter Allee 45, 14195 Berlin, Germany.  E-mail address: simone.grimm@fu-berlin.de (S. Grimm).  1 Both authors contributed equally to the manuscript.  1053-8119/$ – see front matter © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.04.004  and Owen, 2000). While the exact role of the ACC is still debated, most theories suggest a role in cognitive control, including error detection, conﬂict monitoring, and/or task switching (Botvinick et al., 2004; Carter and van Veen, 2007; Hyaﬁl et al., 2009).  Previous emotion and WM research has found that while emotional state, mood, or context inﬂuences working memory (Aoki et al., 2011; Erk et al., 2007; Gray et al., 2002), the use of emotional stimuli has no consistent impact on working memory performance. For example, Kensinger and Corkin (2003) examined how the emotional content of stimuli inﬂuenced working memory performance across different tasks. They found no inﬂuence of emotion on accuracy, but slower reaction times for negative compared to neutral stimuli in a nonverbal working memory task. A recent study by Becerril and Barch (2011) supports these ﬁndings to some extent by showing higher accuracy but slower reaction times for negative compared to neutral nonverbal stimuli. Other studies using emotional stimuli reported no impact whatsoever on WM performance (Döhnel et al., 2008; Perlstein et al., 2002). Regarding the question whether emotional content affects processes supporting working memory, Perlstein et al. (2002) found evidence that emotional content reduced working memory related brain activation in right DLPFC. This result would suggest that emotional content might hinder performance on working memory tasks. Two recent fMRI studies however reported either no effect of emotional content on DLPFC activity (Döhnel et al., 2008) or increased DLPFC activity during an emotional WM task (Neta and Whalen, 2011).  It is also still unclear how working memory performance and associated brain activation is mediated by the properties of an emotional stimulus. One dimensional approach to emotion emphasizes the contribution of two orthogonal components, namely arousal and valence (Lang et al., 1999; Russell, 1980). Arousal refers to how strongly an emotion is  S. Grimm et al. / NeuroImage 61 (2012) 1188–1194  1189  to be excluded due to fulﬁlling the criteria for an axis I or axis II disorder according to DSM-IV criteria, diagnosed neurological and general medical disorders or clinically relevant abnormalities. Mood and arousal before and after the experiment were measured by means of the Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire (MDBF; Steyer et al., 1997). Intelligence was assessed using a word recognition test (WST; Schmidt and Metzler, 1992), which is functionally equivalent to the widely used NART test (Nelson and O'Connell, 1978). All subjects were right-handed as assessed with the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldﬁeld, 1971). The study was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Charité University Medicine (Berlin, Germany). All subjects gave written informed consent before screening.  Experimental design  Emotional stimuli were German nouns taken from the Berlin Affective Word List (BAWL; Võ et al., 2009). According to the BAWL norms, the emotional words were classiﬁed as positive, negative and neutral (35 different words per condition). The words of the three valence conditions were matched for word length (5–8 letters), imageability and frequency (total frequency of appearance per million words). The emotional arousal was equivalent in the positive and negative conditions. The stimuli were consecutively presented within a 2-back working memory task (Fig. 1), which provides a novel means of studying the interface between verbal working memory and emotion. Subjects were required to monitor a series of words and to respond whenever a word was presented that was the same as the one presented 2 trials previously. Subjects performed a practice run prior to the experiment followed by 15 blocks of experimental trials. Each block consisted of 15 words of either positive, negative or neutral valence presented for 500 ms with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 1500 ms and was followed by a ﬁxation trial (10–14 s). During the experiment 75 words per condition were presented. The condition order was randomized across the task. Stimuli were generated by Presentation® (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Albany, CA, USA) and presented via video goggles (VisuaStim digital). Participants responded by pushing a ﬁber-optic light sensitive key press.  After the fMRI session participants rated all emotional words presented during the task on a 7-point scale regarding emotional valence (−1=very negative/3=very positive) and on a 5-point scale regarding emotional arousal (1=not arousing/5=very arousing) according to the BAWL norms.  experienced on a continuum that varies from calm to excitement. Valence refers to the subjective experience of the affective value or quality of an emotional stimulus independent of its sensory quality on a continuum that varies from positive to negative with neutral in the middle (Bradley and Lang, 1994). Imaging studies demonstrated that arousal and valence differ not only psychologically, but also in their neural substrates (Anderson et al., 2003; Dolcos et al., 2004; Grimm et al., 2006; Viinikainen et al., 2010). Arousal has been linked to neural activity in the amygdala as well as in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) (Anders et al., 2004; Dolcos et al., 2004; Grimm et al., 2006). Valence has been associated with neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (ventromedial prefronal cortex and pregenual anterior cingulate; VMPFC/PACC) and the lateral prefrontal cortex including the ventrolateral (VLPFC) and dorsolateral (DLPFC) prefrontal cortex (Dolcos et al., 2004; Grimm et al., 2006). The valence hypothesis states that the left prefrontal cortex is dominant in the processing of positive emotions, whereas the right prefrontal cortex is dominant in the processing of negative emotions (Davidson and Irwin, 1999). There is some evidence for valence related speciﬁcity in the medial prefrontal cortex (George et al., 1995; Paradiso et al., 1999) during approach or appetitive tasks, supporting the role of this region in appetitive or reward circuits (Rolls, 2000; Wager et al., 2003). On the other hand numerous studies described medial prefrontal involvement in processing emotional stimuli irrespective of valence (see review by Phan et al., 2002), therefore suggesting that its involvement could be attributed to its role in the processing of arousal. Only few studies have investigated the effects of valence and arousal on working memory performance using fMRI and reported conﬂicting results: While Perlstein et al. (2002) found reduced activation in the right DLPFC during negative stimuli, Döhnel et al. (2008) report no valence- or arousal speciﬁc effects in the prefrontal cortex. Conversely, Becerril and Barch (2011) used a nonverbal 2-back task and found greater activation in the left DLPFC during negative and in the medial prefrontal cortex during positive stimuli. All these studies used nonverbal stimuli to investigate the effect of emotional content on WM performance and associated neural activity which raises the question how the interaction between emotional content, WM performance and associated neural activity might be inﬂuenced during a verbal WM task. Previous studies found domain related speciﬁcity with increased left prefrontal activity during verbal and increased right prefrontal activity during non-verbal WM tasks (Smith and Jonides, 1999; Smith et al., 1996).  The aim of the present study was to investigate the behavioral and neural effects of emotional content and emotional components, i.e. valence and arousal, in the context of a verbal working memory task. We employed a 2-back task with standardized emotional words from the Berlin Affective Word List (BAWL; Võ et al., 2009) and incorporated positive, negative and neutral words matched according to different arousal levels in order to elucidate valence and arousal effects. The experiment was conducted with respect to the following questions: (i) Is verbal working memory inﬂuenced by emotion and is this effect valence- or arousal dependent? (ii) How does the integration of emotion and WM processes affect brain activity in emotionrelated (medial PFC) and WM-related (DLPFC) regions? (iii) Is WM associated brain activity differentially dependent on arousal or valence? (iv) Are there any lateralization effects due to domain and/or valence speciﬁcity?  Methods  Subjects  Twenty healthy male subjects (age 23.5±2.4; range 18–28 years; IQ 106.7±6.7) were recruited through advertisements. Somatic as well as psychiatric health status was evaluated by a structured psychiatric interview (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) (Sheehan et al., 1998) performed by a psychologist. No subject had  Fig. 1. Experimental Paradigm. Schematic representation of the n-back task.

Grimm et al. / NeuroImage 61 (2012) 1188–1194  Functional data were acquired on a Siemens Trio 3T scanner using a standard echo planar imaging sequence with 37 oblique axial slices of 3 mm (ﬁeld of view 192 mm, 3 × 3 mm in-plane, repetition time 2 s, echo time 30 ms, ﬂip angle 70°). One run of 331 volumes was acquired, as well as a T1-weighted high-resolution MP-Rage scan.  Results  Behavioral results  Reaction times  Statistical analysis  Behavioral data  Accuracy was deﬁned as the ratio of correct responses (correctly pressed and correctly not pressed) to total number of stimuli. Reaction times of the correct responses were analyzed. Accuracy and reaction times were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the factor valence (positive, negative, neutral). In the same manner, the valence and arousal word ratings were analyzed. Further statistical analysis was done using post hoc t-tests. All tests were two-tailed and the signiﬁcant threshold was set at a probability of p≤0.05. All statistical analyses were carried out using PASW (version 18.0, Chicago: SPSS Inc., Illinois, USA).  FMRI data  FMRI data were analyzed using MATLAB 2008b (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) and SPM8 (Statistical parametric mapping software, SPM; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK; http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk). Functional data were realigned to the ﬁrst volume, corrected for motion artifacts, mean-adjusted by proportional scaling, normalized into standard stereotactic space (template provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute), and spatially smoothed using a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. The time series were high-pass ﬁltered to eliminate low-frequency components (ﬁlter width 128 s) and adjusted for systematic differences across trials. Statistical analysis was performed by modeling the different conditions convolved with a hemodynamic response function as explanatory variables within the context of the general linear model on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Realignment parameters were included as additional regressors in the statistical model. A ﬁxed-effect model at a single-subject level was performed to create images of parameter estimates, which were then entered into a second-level random-effects analysis. For the fMRI data group analysis the contrast images from the analysis of the individual participants were analyzed using one-sample t tests. Clusters of activation were identiﬁed with a global height threshold of p b0.001, uncorrected and a cluster threshold of greater than 25. FMRI analyses focused on the effect of emotion on the n-back task. Then ROI analyses were performed to further investigate signal changes and to correlate them with measures for valence and arousal. For the ROI analyses of peak voxels, coordinates which were obtained in the group analyses (Table 1) were selected. Regions of interest were functionally deﬁned by centering spheres on the respective peak voxels with a radius of 5 mm. Analyses were carried out for the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC; −36, 5, 38), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC; 42, 41, 34), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; 9, 23, 37), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC; −3, 29, −5), pregenual anterior cingulate cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PACC/VMPFC; 6, 59, 4), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC; 0, 53, 37) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; 3, −46, 31). For the ROI analyses, % signal changes for the different conditions were extracted for each subject separately using Marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/). For each event % signal changes were calculated relative to the mean signal intensity of this ROI across the whole experiment. To detect the association of signal changes in response to the emotional component of the n-back task with postscanning ratings of valence and arousal, the correlation between the individual scores of postscanning ratings and signal changes in the regions of interest was analyzed in a post-hoc, region-of-interest analysis using Marsbar (see above). Subjects' individual scores were correlated with signal changes during emotional words using Pearson correlation analysis.

The global height threshold was set to pb0.001 uncorrected, the extent threshold to k=25 voxels for all contrasts. The values in the table represent maximum z values with peak voxel coordinates in the MNI stereotactic space.  There was a trend for slower reaction times in negative compared to positive words (negative words: 474.98 ms±103.6; positive words: 440.35 ms±90.0 (mean±SD); t(1,19)=2.07, p=0.05).  Accuracy  No signiﬁcant effect of word valence on accuracy measures for posi tive, negative and neutral words was obtained.  Postscanning ratings  ANOVAs showed a signiﬁcant main effect of valence for both the emotional valence and arousal ratings (valence: F(2,38)=102.88, p b0.001; arousal: F(2,38)= 23.05, p b0.001). Post hoc comparisons revealed that valence ratings systematically varied with emotion condition: positive words were rated signiﬁcantly more pleasant than negative (t(1,19)=10.74, pb0.001) and neutral words (t(1,13)= 11.63, pb0.001).

Furthermore, positive words were rated signiﬁcantly more arousing than negative (t(1,19)=2.39, pb0.05).  FMRI results  To investigate how the integration of emotion and WM processes affect brain activity in emotion-related and WM-related regions, the ﬁrst step of the analysis focused on the effects of emotional and neutral words in the context of a 2-back task. Task conditions were associated with BOLD signal changes in the bilateral DLPFC, dACC, medial cortical regions such as the VMPFC/PACC, DMPFC, PCC, medial  temporal gyrus and also in the rostral ACC and orbitofrontal cortex. We then performed ROI analyses to ascertain whether signal increases or decreases were associated with positive, negative and neutral words in the respective regions. These analyses revealed that the 2-back task induced activations (signal increases) in the bilateral DLPFC and dACC, but deactivations (signal decreases) in cortical midline regions such as the PACC/VMPFC, DMPFC, PCC and rostral ACC. Emotional words yielded higher signal increases than neutral words in the bilateral DLPFC, while cortical midline regions showed higher signal decreases during neutral words. Bar diagrams show clear differential involvement of DLPFC and cortical midline regions in emotional and neutral words during the working memory task (see Table 1 and Figs. 2a and b).  Fig. 2. a and b. Effect of emotional and neutral words. Signal changes during ﬁxation cross, positive, negative and neutral words in (a) the bilateral DLPFC (left DLPFC (−36, 5, 38) and right DLPFC (42, 41, 34)) and (b) cortical midline regions (PCC (3, −46, 31), DMPFC (0, 53, 37), VMPFC/PACC (6, 59, 4) and rACC (−3, 29, −5)).

Abbreviation: dACC=dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.  The conditions positive words vs. negative words were contrasted to obtain signal changes speciﬁc for each valence. The comparison negative>positive (N>P) revealed signiﬁcantly higher signal intensities in the dACC, right insula and right thalamus (see Table 1 and Fig. 3). No signiﬁcant differential activations were found for the opposite contrast P>N.  Parametric dependence of neural activity on emotional valence and arousal was investigated by correlating postscanning ratings of positive, negative and neutral words with fMRI signal changes during the working memory task for emotional words. Signal changes in right DLPFC correlated with arousal ratings regardless of valence (positive words: r=0.67, p b0.001; negative words: r=0.55, p b0.05; neutral words: r=0.50, p b0.05). Signal changes in the VMPFC correlated with valence ratings for positive words (r=0.57, p b0.05).  No relationship between signal changes during the n-back task and accuracy of task performance was obtained. Reaction times for positive words correlated with signal changes in the left DLPFC (r=0.48, p b0.05).  In an exploratory analysis we investigated differences between subjects classiﬁed as “high emotional” or “low emotional” according to their post hoc valence ratings. Subjects were classiﬁed as “high emotional” if they rated positive and negative words very high or low, respectively. “High emotional” subjects showed signiﬁcantly higher signal intensities in left DLPFC during the n-back task for positive words (pb0.05) and in the dACC during the n-back task for negative words (pb0.05).  Discussion  Our ﬁndings demonstrate that emotional content has no impact on performance in a verbal working memory task. It is interesting to note though, that while reaction times for emotional and neutral stimuli did not differ signiﬁcantly during the n-back task, reaction times in positive stimuli were numerically faster and indicate a stronger arousal effect of positive compared to negative and neutral words. This is also supported by results of the postscanning ratings, which conﬁrmed that positive words were experienced as signiﬁcantly more arousing. Results also revealed differential involvement of prefrontal cortex in the emotional working memory task. While emotion leads to an increase of activation in cognition-related lateral prefrontal regions, cognitive effort yields enhanced deactivation in emotionrelated cortical midline regions. Although there were no valencespeciﬁc effects in the DLPFC, negative words elicited stronger signal increases in the dACC. During the emotional WM task neural activity was modulated in the right DLPFC by arousal and in the VMPFC by positive valence. Furthermore, slower reaction times for positive words were correlated with neural activity in left DLPFC.  Our ﬁndings regarding WM performance are in accordance with previous studies that found no impact of emotion on working memory performance (Döhnel et al., 2008; Perlstein et al., 2002). Even  though not statistically signiﬁcant, our ﬁnding of slower reaction times in negative words conﬁrms results by Kensinger and Corkin (2003) and Becerril and Barch (2011) who reported slower reaction times for negative stimuli in a nonverbal WM task. One could hypothesize that reaction times may be more sensitive to small modulations by emotional content than is accuracy and therefore emotional content may be more likely to modulate the efﬁciency with which information is processed as compared with the accuracy with which it is held online. The recruitment of neural networks implicated in emotion processing might result in additional inputs to the working memory system (e.g., those associated with emotion and arousal; LeDoux, 2002). Therefore, it may be that many additional facets of information must be inhibited to allow for processing of only the task-relevant information in the context of the 2-back task. This increased demand on inhibition may slow the response times. The emotional content increased WM related brain activation in the bilateral DLPFC, as mentioned above, this did not result in improved WM performance during emotional stimuli, though. N-back tasks have been used in numerous studies to demonstrate that the DLPFC is implicated in WM (Bor et al., 2004; Goldman-Rakic, 1994; Jonides et al., 1993; Petrides, 1994; Rowe et al., 2000), but it has been suggested that emotional content reduces working memory related brain activation in the right DLPFC and might therefore hinder performance (Perlstein et al., 2002). In our study, emotional content did neither impair nor improve the performance in the WM task, but elicited more neural recruitment in the bilateral DLPFC, which might reﬂect that more DLPFC activity is necessary to maintain performance despite emotional stimuli (Neta and Whalen, 2011). The ﬁnding that neural responses during WM are associated with reaction times supports this: the more the DLPFC recruitment during emotional words, the longer the reaction times. As also suggested by the behavioral results, reaction times as a more sensitive indicator of task performance show that more activity in the DLPFC is necessary to perform the WM task (Neta and Whalen, 2011).  In contrast to previous studies we used verbal stimuli to investigate the effect of emotional content on WM performance and associated neural activity, which might explain the conﬂicting ﬁndings. Furthermore, Perlstein et al. (2002) who reported reduced activation in rDLPFC during emotional WM used a modiﬁed delayed match-to-sample task, which might not be associated with the same neural activity pattern as an n-back task. Indeed, two previous studies which employed an n-back task with nonverbal emotional stimuli reported either no effect of emotional content on DLPFC activity (Döhnel et al., 2008) or increased DLPFC activity (Neta and Whalen, 2011).  The higher overall signal intensities in the right than in the left DLPFC in our study indicates stronger recruitment of the right DLPFC in the WM task, which conﬁrms ﬁndings by Erk et al. (2007). An explanation might be, that even though a verbal task would require less right DLPFC engagement due to domain related speciﬁcity with increased left prefrontal activity during verbal and increased right prefrontal activity during non-verbal WM tasks (Smith and  S. Grimm et al. / NeuroImage 61 (2012) 1188–1194  1193  Jonides, 1999; Smith et al., 1996), the right DLPFC is additionally recruited in an implicit emotional judgment task (Grimm et al., 2008; Northoff et al., 2004).  We failed to see any general lateralization pattern of valence-related activity. Even though there was a stronger recruitment of the left DLPFC during positive and right DLPFC during negative words, the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. The inclusion of neutral words allowed us to disentangle valence from arousal effects. Both valence conditions boosted a signal gain in DLPFC, which may result from an arousal effect or reﬂect higher cognitive effort due to interference with emotion. The hypothesis of a general arousal effect is supported by the association of left DLPFC signal intensities with arousal, but not with valence ratings as well as by results in high emotional subjects. The correlation between left DLPFC activity and longer reaction times for positive words suggests a subtle speciﬁc effect as stated in the valence hypothesis with dominant processing of positive emotions in the left prefrontal cortex (Davidson and Irwin, 1999). Stronger recruitment of the left DLPFC during the emotional component of the task may result in affected performance in the cognitive task as reﬂected in longer reaction times. Imaging studies linked arousal to neural activity in the amygdala as well as in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) (Anders et al., 2004; Dolcos et al., 2004; Grimm et al., 2006), while valence has been associated with neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (ventromedial prefronal cortex and pregenual anterior cingulate; VMPFC/PACC) and the lateral prefrontal cortex including the ventrolateral (VLPFC) and dorsolateral (DLPFC) prefrontal cortex (Dolcos et al., 2004; Grimm et al., 2006). The difference when compared to our ﬁndings might be due to the fact that our task was not “purely” emotional but rather a cognitive task with emotional confounds. A signiﬁcant effect of negative emotional valence was found in the dACC, an effect earlier described by Viinikainen et al. (2010). Activity in this region during n-back tasks is often described in relation to increased effort, complexity, or attention (Botvinick et al., 2004; Duncan and Owen, 2000). Since negative words seem to be less arousing in the context of an n-back task (see Behavioral results) the distinction between cognitive and emotional processing might be less deﬁned and they therefore elicit more neural activity in the dACC due to increased conﬂict monitoring, and/or task switching (Botvinick et al., 2004; Carter and van Veen, 2007; Hyaﬁl et al., 2009). This is also supported by the signiﬁcantly higher dACC activation during negative words. The lower activity in the dACC during neutral stimuli might be associated to decreased conﬂict between cognitive and emotional task components. In cortical midline regions such as the VMPFC/PACC, DMPFC, rACC and PCC we found a stronger effect of neutral words as compared to emotional words: cognitive effort without emotional confounds (neutral stimuli) leads to stronger deactivation in emotion-related brain regions. These cortical midline regions are part of the default-mode network (Raichle and Gusnard, 2005; Raichle et al., 2001) and characterized by deactivations during various emotional–cognitive tasks that require subjects to attend to external stimuli (Grimm et al., 2009; Gusnard et al., 2001; Northoff et al., 2004; Raichle and Gusnard, 2005). The converse relationship between medial and lateral prefrontal activity during emotional– cognitive interaction has been described as reciprocal modulation (Northoff et al., 2004) and stronger anticorrelations between these areas have been associated with better working memory performance (Hampson et al., 2010).  We found that only the neural activity in the VMPFC during the emotional WM task was parametrically modulated by positive valence. Valence has previously been associated with neural activity in the VMPFC (Dolcos et al., 2004; Grimm et al., 2006; Viinikainen et al., 2010; Wager et al., 2003). On the other hand numerous studies described medial prefrontal involvement in processing emotional stimuli irrespective of valence (see review by Colibazzi et al., 2010; Phan et al., 2002; Viinikainen et al., 2010), therefore suggesting that its involvement could be attributed to its role in the processing of  arousal, which is supported by the results in the other cortical midline regions where we found neither differential valence-dependent activity nor a parametric modulation of activity by valence.  There are several limitations to this study. The rather small sample size of this investigation has to be considered when interpreting the results. We only included a 2-back task and did not test the effects of increasing cognitive load. While load is often varied up to 3-back (Neta and Whalen, 2011; Owen et al., 2005), some authors have questioned the validity of results when the ability to successfully perform the task decreases (Callicott et al., 1999). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that ﬁndings might be confounded due to a ceiling effect. Furthermore, we conﬁned the study to males within a limited age range. Gender differences have previously been observed in emotion paradigms (Sabatinelli et al., 2004; Wrase et al., 2003). These studies investigated the effect of affective pictures without a cognitive task, while we focused on a cognitive task with emotional content. To rule out a gender speciﬁc effect subsequent studies should include female subjects.  Conclusion  The current study indicates that emotional content has no impact on performance in a verbal WM task. Regions of the prefrontal cortex are differentially involved in the emotional working memory task. Emotion leads to an increase of activation in cognition-related lateral prefrontal regions, while cognitive effort yields enhanced deactivation in emotion-related cortical midline regions. The stronger DLPFC recruitment during emotional stimuli could reﬂect an arousal effect or higher cognitive effort due to interference with emotion. The hypothesis of a general arousal effect is supported by the parametric modulation of DLPFC activity by arousal, while no valence-speciﬁc effects could be observed. Deactivations in cortical midline regions were stronger during neutral stimuli and parametrically modulated by valence.  References  Anders, S., Lotze, M., Erb, M., Grodd, W., Birbaumer, N., 2004.

However,   little   is   known about   the   brain   mechanisms   that   underlie   the   comprehension   of   indirect   speech.   In   this   study,   we   conducted   a  functional   MRI   experiment   using   a   scenario   reading   task   to  compare   the   neural   activity   induced by  an   indirect   reply   (a   type   of   indirect   speech)   and   a   literal   sentence.   Participants   read   a   short   scenario   consisting   of   three   sentences.   The   ﬁrst   two   sentences   explained   the   situation   of   the   protagonists, whereas   the   third   sentence   had   an   indirect,   literal,   or   unconnected   meaning.   The   indirect   reply   condition primarily   activated   the   bilateral   fronto-temporal   networks   (Brodmann’s   Areas   (BA)   47   and   21)   and  the dorso-medial   prefrontal   cortex   (dmPFC).   In   the   literal   sentence   condition,   only   the   left   fronto-temporal network   (BA   45   and   21)  and   the   dmPFC   (posterior   region)   were   activated.   In  addition,   we   found   greater activation   resulting   from   comprehension   of   an   indirect   reply   than   from   literal   sentence   comprehension in   the   dmPFC,   the   left   middle   frontal   area   (BA   9),   the   bilateral   inferior   frontal   area   (BA   9/47),   and   the   right middle   temporal   area   (BA   21).   Our   ﬁndings   indicate   that   the   right   and   left   fronto-temporal   networks play   a  crucial   role   in   detecting   contextual   violations,   whereas   the   medial   frontal   cortex   is   important   for generating   inferences   to   make   sense   of   remarks   within   a  context.  © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.  1.  Introduction  Indirect  speech  is  used  to  convey  non-literal  or  indirect  meanings  and  improves  the  efﬁciency  of  everyday  communication.  In  the last  half  century,  indirect  speech  has  been  studied  by  philosophers, linguists,  and  psycholinguists.  Grice  (1975)  proposed  an  inﬂuential  theory  of  conversation  (the  Cooperative  Principle),  which  has guided  research  on  the  comprehension  of  indirect  speech.  Consider the  following  exchange:  Peter:  Mary:   Do  you  want  some  coffee? Coffee  would  keep  me   awake.  In  this  exchange,  Mary  does  not  directly  answer  Peter’s  question. Her  utterance  seems  to  convey  not  just  literal  meanings  but  also non-literal,  implicit  meanings.  That  is,  the  utterance  implies  the speaker’s  intention.  In  Grice’s  view,  her  utterance  has  violated  the “Maxim  of  Relevance.”  However,  because  the  listener  assumes  the speaker  is  being  relevant,  the  listener  will  try  to  infer  an  intended meaning.  Grice  called  such  inferences  conversational  implicatures.  ∗ Corresponding  author  at:  Department  of  Psychology,  Hokkaido  University,  Kita 10,   Nishi  7,  Kita-ku,  Sapporo  060-0810,  Japan.

Following  Grice’s  view,  Holtgraves  (1998,  1999)  proposed  a  model describing  the  interpretive  processes  involved  in  certain  types  of indirect  speech.  This  model  assumes  that  the  listener  recognizes when  a  speaker  has  violated  the  “Maxim  of  Relevance”  and  generates  an  inference  to  understand  the  statement.  The  generated inference  is  based  on  the  listener’s  belief  about  why  the  violation occurred.  According  to  this  model,  a  major  motivation  for  violating the  Maxim  of  Relevance  is  “face  management,”  the  communicative  practices  that  individuals  use  to  mutually  protect  one  another’s “face”  or  public  self  (Brown  &  Levinson,  1987).  Holtgraves  (1999) also  indicated  that  indirect  speech  often  has  a  negative  connotation,  and  people  generally  interpret  indirect  speech  as  conveying  a negative  opinion.  Recently  Pinker,  Nowak,  and  Lee  (2008)  proposed  a  three-part theory  of  indirect  speech  using  game  theory,  social  psychology, and  evolutionary  psychology.  Following  the  conversation  theory of  Grice  and  the  politeness  theory  of  Brown  and  Levinson  (1987), Pinker  emphasized  that  indirect  speech  allows  for  plausible  deniability,  permitting  a  cooperative  listener  to  accept  what  is  said and  recognize  that  an  uncooperative  listener  cannot  react  negatively  to  an  ambiguous,  indirect  suggestion.  In  cases  of  plausible deniability,  a  negative  message  can  be  conveyed  without  losing  face,  thus  making  indirect  speech  an  important  face-saving device  in  everyday  communication.  These  studies  highlight  several  M.  Shibata  et  al.  /  Neuropsychologia  49 (2011) 3542–  3550  3543  important  features  of  indirect  speech.  First,  a  listener  detects  the speaker’s  violation  of  the  Maxim  of  Relevance  to  identify  that  indirect  speech  is  being  used.  Second,  the  listener  needs  to  infer  the mental  states  of  others  (i.e.,  derive  beliefs,  intentions,  and  emotional  states)  to  comprehend  the  meaning  of  the  indirect  speech. Third,  indirect  speech  functions  as  a  face-saving  device  because  it provides  plausible  deniability.  These  aspects  of  indirectness  and politeness  in  speech  allow  for  complex  relationships  in  our  daily communication.  in  patients  have   Neuropsychological  studies   investigated whether  the  left  or  right  hemisphere  plays  a  speciﬁc  role  in  indirect  speech  comprehension  (Channon,  Pellijeff,  &  Rule,  2005;  Foldi, 1987;  Happe,  1993;  Hirst,  LeDoux,  &  Stein,  1984;  Stemmer,  Giroux, &  Joanette,  1994).  For  example,  Foldi  (1987)  examined  the  ability of  patients  with  left  and  right  hemisphere  damage  to  assess  their comprehension  of  indirect  requests.  Participants  viewed  two   slides and  listened  to  the  accompanying  verbal  exchange.  The  participant would  observe  the  ﬁrst  speaker  ask  one  of  three  possible  question types  (indirect  command,  direct  command,  or  wh-question).  The second  speaker  would  then  complete  the  exchange  with  one  of  four response  types  (pragmatically  appropriate,  literal,  physically  veritable,  or  syntactically  similar).  After  each  exchange,  the  participant was  asked  to  judge  whether  the  response  of  the  second  speaker was  appropriate.  The  results  showed  that  patients  with  right  hemisphere  damage  had  a  selective  difﬁculty  for  appreciating  indirect commands.  They  more  often  preferred  literal  interpretations  to pragmatic  interpretations  than  normal  and  aphasic,  subjects.  Hirst et  al.  (1984)  also  examined  the  ability  of  patients  with  left  (anterior aphasics)  and  right  hemisphere  damage  to  comprehend  indirect speech.  Their  material  consisted  of  40  videotaped  episodes  with two  protagonists.  For  example,  when  eating  dinner,  one  of  the  protagonists  might  ask,  “Can  you  play  tennis?”  (direct  question);  in this  example,  a  simple  “yes”  or  “no”  response  would  be  appropriate.  Alternatively,  the  protagonist  might  ask,  “Can  you  pass  the salt?”  (indirect  request);  in  this  case,  the  action  of  passing  the  salt would  be  appropriate.  Patients  with  left  hemisphere  damage  (anterior  aphasics)  had  difﬁculty  comprehending  an  utterance,  “Can  you X?”  in  the  form  of  a  direct  question  but  could  fully  understand  the same  utterance  when  the  context  suggested  that  it  was  an  indirect request.  In  contrast,  patients  with  right  hemisphere  damage  had  little  difﬁculty  understanding  direct  questions,  but  they  often  judged that  inappropriate  actions  (e.g.,  “picking  up  a  racket  and  swinging  it  while  eating  dinner”)  were  appropriate.  Hirst  et  al.  (1984) suggested  that  these  patients  might  have  difﬁculty  assessing  their scripts  of  world  knowledge  and  have  difﬁculty  with  the  pragmatic component.  Recently,  Martin-Rodriguez  and  Leon-Carrion  (2010)  used  a meta-analysis  to  review  26  studies  comparing  the  performance  of patients  with  acquired  brain  injury  (ABI)  and  healthy  controls  in four  tasks  widely  used  to  study  the  Theory  of  Mind  (ToM):  a  ﬁrstorder  belief  task,  a  second-order  belief  task,  an  indirect  speech  task, and  a  social  faux  pas  task.  In  this  meta-analysis,  the  number  of correct  responses  in  each  task  was  used  as  a  performance  indicator  for  both  the  patients  and  the  healthy  controls.  For  the  effect sizes  (ES)  measure,  Cohen’s  d  was  used  to  standardize  the  mean differences  in  ToM  performance  between  the  ABI  patients  and  the healthy  controls.  To  explain  part  of  the  heterogeneity  between the  results  of  the  studies,  moderator  variables  (demographic,  taskrelated,  and  clinical  moderator  variables)  were  coded.  Using  these moderator  variables,  authors  performed  four  independent  metaregression  analyses  (ﬁrst  order  ToM  tasks,  second  order  ToM  tasks, understanding  indirect  speech,  and  faux  pas).  The  results  of  these meta-regression  analyses  showed  that  demographic  variables  (differences  in  age,  gender  and  education  level  between  samples)  did not  signiﬁcantly  affect  effect  sizes.  With  respect  to  clinical  moderator  variables,  studies  with  patients  with  frontal  lobe  lesions  reported  higher  ESs  only  in  faux  pas  tasks,  and  the  proportion of  patients  with  lesions  in  the  right  hemisphere  was  positively associated  with  ESs  in  indirect  speech  and  faux  pas  tasks.  Thus, these  neuropsychological  studies  and  meta-analyses  suggest  that the  right  hemisphere  plays  a  crucial  role  in  indirect  speech  comprehension.  Neuroimaging  studies  that  attempt  to  identify  the  neural  basis of  understanding  indirect  speech  have  not  yet  been  attempted; however,  the  manner  in  which  people  comprehend  non-literal meanings,  such  as  irony  (Eviatar  &  Just,  2006;  Rapp  et  al.,  2010; Uchiyama  et  al.,  2006;  Wakusawa  et  al.,  2007;  Wang,  Lee,  Sigman,  & Dapretto,  2006,  2007),  humor  (Bartolo,  Benuzzi,  Nocetti,  Baraldi,  & Nichelli,  2006;  Brunet,  Sarfati,  Hardy-Bayle,  &  Decety,  2000;  Goel  & Dolan,  2001),  metaphor  comprehension  (Bottini  et  al.,  1994;  Rapp, Leube,  Erb,  Grodd,  &  Kircher,  2004,  2007),  and  idiom  comprehension  (Boulenger,  Hauk,  &  Pulvermuller,  2009;  Lauro,  Tettamanti, Cappa,  &  Papagno,  2008;  Zempleni,  Haverkort,  Renken,  &  Stowe, 2007),  has  been  the  focus  of  many  neuroimaging  studies.  Some of  these  neuroimaging  studies  may  provide  insight  into  the  brain regions  that  mediate  the  comprehension  of  indirect  speech.  In particular,  irony  and  indirect  speech  involve  similar  processes.  In both  processes,  what  the  speaker  says  does  not  necessarily  correspond  to  what  he/she  intends.  To  understand  these  non-literal statements,  the  listener  has  to  infer  the  speaker’s  mental  state. This  mentalizing  process  (second-order  ToM  processing)  is  critical  for  the  comprehension  of  indirect  speech  and  irony.  Rapp  et  al. (2010)  reviewed  thirteen  studies  of  patients  with  brain  lesions and  ﬁve  studies  that  used  fMRI  to  investigate  irony  comprehension.  On  the  basis  of  these  studies,  the  authors  highlighted  three regions  involved  in  irony  comprehension:  the  medial  prefrontal cortex  (Shamay-Tsoory,  Tomer,  &  Aharon-Peretz,  2005;  Wakusawa et  al.,  2007),  the  left  hemisphere  language  regions  (Shamay-Tsoory &  Aharon-Peretz,  2007;  Uchiyama  et  al.,  2006;  Wang  et  al.,  2006; Zaidel,  Kasher,  Soroker,  &  Batori,  2002),  and  their  right  hemisphere homologues  (Eviatar  &  Just,  2006;  Mitchell  &  Crow,  2005).  The authors  also  suggested  that  the  medial  prefrontal  region  is  a  key region  for  ToM  processing,  the  right  hemisphere  language  region is  involved  in  irony  detection,  and  the  left  hemisphere  language region  is  involved  in  irony  comprehension.  The  neuropsychological  and  neuroimaging  studies  described above  suggest  that  the  detection  and  comprehension  processing of  pragmatic  speech  are  associated  with  regions  that  play  a  role  in mentalizing  and  semantic  processes,  especially  the  medial  frontal cortex  and  the  bilateral  fronto-temporal  networks.  To  evaluate these  neural  substrates,  we   conducted  an  fMRI  experiment  using a  scenario  reading  task.  There  are  some  types  of  indirect  speech (e.g.,  request,  question,  and  reply).  For  example,  an  indirect  request (“Can  you  open  the  window?”)  is  an  utterance  that  conveys  the information  regarding  the  listener’s  ability  to  open  the  window, which  prompts  a  speciﬁc  action.  In  contrast,  an  indirect  reply  is  an utterance  that  ﬂouts  the  Maxim  of  Relevance  (Grice,  1975)  and  that expresses  the  speaker’s  intention.  In  this  study,  we  focused  on  the comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply  and  evaluated  the  neural  activity  associated  with  the  comprehension  processing.  As  with  previous studies,  we  predicted  that  neural  activity  would  be  increased  in  the medial  frontal  cortex,  which  is  associated  with  mentalizing  processes.  Additionally,  we  predicted  that  neural  activity  would  be increased  in  the  right  and  left  inferior  frontal  areas  which  have been  implicated  in  the  detection  and  comprehension  of  non-literal or  indirect  meanings.  2.  Methods  2.1.  Participants  Fifteen  graduate  and  undergraduate  students  (eleven  men   and  four  women; mean  age  =  25.2  years)  participated  in  this  experiment.  All  of  the  participants  had  no  3544  M.  Shibata  et  al.  /  Neuropsychologia  49 (2011) 3542–  3550  history  of  mental  disorders,  were  native  Japanese  speakers,  and  were  right-handed. Handedness  was   assessed  using  the  Edinburgh  Handedness  Survey  (Oldﬁeld,  1971). The  experiment  was   approved  by  the  Ethics  Committee  of  Hokkaido  University Graduate  School  of  Medicine  and  performed  in  accordance  with  the  Declaration of   Helsinki.  All  of  the  participants  gave  their  written  informed  consent  prior  to participation.  2.2.  Stimulus  materials  The  experimental  design  consisted  of  three  conditions  (indirect  reply,  literal  sentence,  and  unconnected  sentence)  and  a  baseline  condition  in  which  only  ﬁxation crosses  were  presented.  For  the  indirect  reply  condition,  scenarios  were  created on   the  basis  of  a  previous  study  by  Holtgraves  (1999).   In  the  Holtgraves  (1999) experiments,  there  were  three  situation  types:  opinions  (“What  did  you  think  of my   presentation?”  – “It’s  hard  to  give  a  good  presentation.”),  disclosures  (“Did  you get   a  raise  yet?”  – “The  economy  is  still  bad.”),  and  request  refusals  (“Can  you  work my   shift  this  Friday?”  –  “I’m  having  a  party  Friday.”).  For  the  present  experiment, we   prepared  eight  of  each  of  the  three  situation  types  in  the  same  way.  Each  scenario  consisted  of  a  short  dialogue  involving  two  people:  an  initial  remark  spoken by   the  ﬁrst  person  to  a  second  person  and  a  reply  by  the  second  person  to  the  initial remark.  In  the  indirect  reply  scenarios,  the  reply  was  a  violation  of  the  relevance maxim,  and  it  was  therefore  likely  to  be  interpreted  as  conveying  a  negative  opinion,  negative  disclosure  or  request  refusal.  In  the  literal  scenarios,  the  context  of  the scenario  supported  a  literal  reading  of  the  reply  and  thus  made  an  indirect  interpretation  unlikely  (e.g.,  “What  do  you  think  of  my   oil  painting?”  –  “Your  painting  is  very good.”).  In  the  unconnected  scenarios,  the  reply  was  not  related  to  the  initial  remark (e.g.,  “What  did  you  think  of  my   English  pronunciation?”  –  “Your  marriage  partner  is not  good.”).  To  eliminate  the  inﬂuence  of  repetition  effects,  we   did  not  use  the  same sentences  or  the  same  names.  Prior  to  the  fMRI  experiment,  we   conducted  a  preliminary  experiment.  All  of  the  materials  were  presented  to  twelve  participants  who were  not  recruited  for  the  main  study.  These  participants  rated  their  acceptability of   the  materials.  As  a  result  of  the  preliminary  experiment,  we   selected  20  scenarios for   each  condition,  and  we  used  16  scenarios  (six  opinions,  ﬁve  disclosures,  and  ﬁve request  refusals)  for  the  fMRI  experiment.  The  remaining  four  scenarios  were  used for  training.  2.3.  Procedures  2.3.1.  Tasks  All  participants  completed  a  scenario  reading  task.  The  scenarios  consisted  of two  parts.  The  ﬁrst  part  explained  the  context  of  the  dialogue  and  gave  an  initial remark  spoken  by  one  person  to  a  second  person.  In  the  second  part,  the  second person  replied  to  the  initial  remark  (target  stimulus).  When  the  target  stimulus was   presented,  the  participant  responded  by  pressing  one  of  three  buttons  of  a response  box  suitable  for  MRI   experiments.  The  participant  indicated  whether  the stimulus  had  a  positive  connotation,  a  negative  connotation,  or  was   meaningless. In   addition  to  the  task  conditions,  a  baseline  condition  was   included  to  minimize habituation.  For  the  baseline  condition,  ﬁxation  crosses  were  presented  in  place  of the   context  of  the  dialogue.  After  presenting  another  ﬁxation,  three  ﬁxation  crosses were  presented  in  place  of  the  target  stimulus,  and  the  participant  indicated  whether the   stimulus  was   meaningless  by  pressing  one  of  the  three  buttons.  2.3.2.  Presentation  of  the  stimuli  and  behavioral  responses  The  MRI   scanning  phase  consisted  of  four  sessions  (118  functional  image  volumes  per  session  with  four  initial  volumes  to  avoid  transient  non  saturation  effects). During  each  scanning  session,  participants  were  presented  with  16  stimuli:  four indirect  reply  scenarios,  four  literal  scenarios,  four  unconnected  scenarios  and  four baseline  stimuli.  In  each  session,  the  order  of  these  16  stimuli  was  randomized.  Each participant  completed  four  sessions,  and  the  order  of  the  sessions  was  counterbalanced  across  subjects.  Each  stimulus  was  displayed  at  the  center  of  a  rear  projection screen.  Participants  viewed  the  screen  through  a  mirror  system  mounted  on  a  head coil.  Participants  were  tested  individually  and  reaction  times  and  judgments  were recorded.  The  ﬁrst  stimuli  (two  sentences)  were  presented  simultaneously  for  8  s and   immediately  followed  by  the  ﬁxation  cross  for  2  s.  The  ﬁnal  stimulus  was  presented  for  4  s  and  immediately  followed  by  the  ﬁxation  cross  for  8  s.  The  presentation of   the  stimuli  and  the  recording  of  the  participants’  responses  were  controlled  with E-prime  (Psychology  Software  Tools,  Inc.).  All  of  the  participants  completed  the experiments  within  30  min.  2.4.   fMRI  data  acquisition  A  whole-body,  1.5-T  Signa  Echo-Speed  scanner  (General  Electric,  Inc.)  was   used to   acquire  two   sets  of  images  from  22  axial  slices:  high-resolution,  T1-weighted anatomical  images  and  gradient-echo,  echo-planar  T2*-weighted  images  with  blood oxygenation  level-dependent  (BOLD)  contrast.  The  parameters  of  the  sequence × were  as  follows:  TR  =  3000  ms,   TE  =  40  ms,   ﬂip  angle  =  90◦,  FOV  =  240    240  mm, × 64,  slice  thickness  =  4  mm,   and  slice  gap  =  0.8  mm.   A  total  of  472  scans matrix  =  64  were  acquired  per  participant  (118  volumes ×  four  sessions).  2.5.   fMRI  data  analysis  The  data  were  analyzed  using  statistical  parametric  mapping  (SPM5,  Welcome Department  of  Cognitive  Neurology,  London,  UK:  http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm; Friston  et  al.,  1995).  After  correcting  for  differences  in  slice  timing  within  each image  volume,  all  functional  volumes  were  realigned  to  the  ﬁrst  volume  of  each participant  to  correct  for  head  motion.  The  volumes  were  subsequently  coregistered  with  each  participant’s  anatomical  image,  spatially  normalized  to  the  Montreal Neurological  Institute  (MNI)  brain  template  and  smoothed  using  an  8-mm,  fullwidth-at-half-maximum  Gaussian  kernel.  We   used  an  event-related  design  to minimize  habituation  and  learning  effects.  Each  stimulus  onset  of  the  target  stimulus  was   convolved  with  a  canonical  hemodynamic  response  function.  For  each subject,  parameter  estimates  were  assessed  with  least  squares  regression  analysis, and  contrast  images  were  computed  for  each  experimental  condition  relative  to  the baseline  condition.  For  the  group  analysis,  a  random-effect  analysis  was   conducted  following  a  general  linear  model  in  which  each  of  the  conditions  was  modeled  with  the  canonical hemodynamic  response  function.  A  high-pass  ﬁlter  (1/128  Hz  cutoff)  was  used  to remove  low-frequency  noise.  Global  scaling  was   not  applied.  Statistical  parametric maps  were  generated  for  each  contrast  of  the  t  statistic  on  a  voxel-by-voxel  basis.  The threshold  for  the  SPM{t}   was  set  at  t  >  3.79  (corresponding  to  uncorrected  p  <  .001), and  the  cluster  size  larger  than  ten  voxels.  3.  Results  3.1.  Behavioral  results  Reaction  time  was  deﬁned  as  the  period  between  the  presentation  of  the  target  stimulus  and  the  button  press  by  the  participant. The  mean  reaction  time  was   2172.7  ms   for  the  indirect  reply  condition,  1691.4  ms   for  the  literal  sentence  condition,  1684.3  ms   for the  unconnected  sentence  condition,  and  709.0  ms   for  the  baseline condition.  A  one-way  ANOVA  revealed  a  signiﬁcant  main  effect  of reaction  time  (F  (3,  59)  =  33.34,  p  <  .0001),  and  Tukey–Kramer  post hoc  tests  revealed  signiﬁcant  differences  in  reaction  time  among the  four  types  of  stimuli  (HSD  (3)  =  2.65,  p  <  .05).  The  mean  reaction  time  for  the  indirect  reply  condition  was  signiﬁcantly  longer than  for  the  other  three  conditions,  and  there  were  no  signiﬁcant differences  between  the  literal  sentence  condition  and  the  unconnected  sentence  condition.  The  mean  rate  of  correct  responses  was 92.1%  for  the  indirect  reply  condition,  94.6%  for  the  literal  sentence condition,  93.3%  for  the  unconnected  sentence  condition,  and  98.3% for  the  baseline  condition.  There  was   no  signiﬁcant  difference  in  the rate  of  correct  responses  (F  (3,  59)  =  1.198,  p  =  .318).  The  participants performed  all  conditions  satisfactorily  (Table  1).  3.2.  Imaging  results  A  main  effect  of  the  indirect  reply  condition  relative  to  the baseline  condition  identiﬁed  activation  in  the  left  middle  frontal gyrus  (MFG;  BA  6/9),  the  dmPFC  (BA  6/8/9/10),  the  bilateral  inferior  frontal  gyri  (IFG;  BA  47),  the  right  middle  temporal  gyrus  (MTG; BA  21),  the  left  anterior  cingulate  cortex  (ACC;  BA  32),  the  caudate, and  the  cuneus  (Table  2  and  Fig.  1).

The  Voxel  t-values  represent  the  value  for  local  maxima  at  p  <  .001  (uncorrected,  t  >  3.79).  The cluster  size  refers  to  the  total  number  of  voxels  included  in  the  cluster  (minimum  of  10  voxels).  tion  relative  to  the  baseline  condition,  the  left  frontal  cortex  was activated  in  rostrolateral  sections  of  the  superior  (BA  8),  middle (BA  11),  medial  (BA  6)  and  IFG  (BA  45).  The  left  MTG   (BA  21),  the caudate  and  the  declive  were  also  activated.  A  main  effect  of  the unconnected  sentence  condition  relative  to  the  baseline  condition was  identiﬁed  activation  in  the  bilateral  IFG  (BA  45/47),  the  left MFG   (BA  8/11)  and  the  right  MTG   (BA  21).  The  primary  goal  of  this  study  was  to  identify  the  different  neural  substrates  involved  in  the  comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply and  a  literal  sentence.  We   analyzed  the  differences  between  the indirect  reply  condition  and  the  literal  sentence  condition  directly. As  shown  in  Fig.  2  and  Table  4,  the  contrast  between  these  two conditions  showed  greater  activation  in  the  dmPFC  (BA  8/9),  the left  MFG   (BA  9),  the  bilateral  IFG  (BA  9/47),  the  left  precuneus  (BA 23/31),  and  the  right  MTG   (BA  21).  A   parametric  modulation  analysis  was  performed  to  ensure  that this  activation  was  not  the  result  of  differences  in  difﬁculty  among the  conditions.  For  each  stimulus,  we  examined  the  correlation between  the  reaction  time  and  the  amplitude  of  the  cortical  activations.  The  reaction  time  for  each  trial  was  entered  into  the  model as  a  parameter  and  used  to  estimate  the  parametric  modulation of  this  effect.  The  behavioral  results  showed  that  the  mean  reaction  time  was   signiﬁcantly  longer  for  the  indirect  reply  condition when  compared  with  the  other  three  conditions.  If  there  were differences  in  difﬁculty  among  the  conditions,  the  results  of  the parametric  modulation  analysis  should  show  a  signiﬁcant  positive correlation  between  the  reaction  time  and  the  amplitude  of  the cortical  responses.  In  the  indirect  reply  condition,  however,  a  signiﬁcant  correlation  (p  <  .001,  uncorrected)  was  observed  only  in  the left  precuneus  (Table  3).

Discussion  The  present  study  was   designed  to  identify  the  different  neural  substrates  involved  in  understanding  the  indirect  reply  and literal  sentence  conditions.  A  main  effect  of  the  indirect  reply  condition  was  identiﬁed  in  the  bilateral  IFG,  the  MTG  (Brodmann’s Areas  (BA)  47  and  21)  and  the  dmPFC.  In  the  literal  sentence condition,  only  the  left  IFG  and  MTG   (BA  45  and  21)  and  the dmPFC  (posterior  region)  were  activated.  We   also  found  greater activation  for  comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply  than  for  a  literal  sentence  comprehension  in  the  dmPFC,  the  left  MFG   (BA 9),  the  bilateral  IFG  (BA  9  and  47),  and  the  right  MTG   (BA  21). Our  results  support  the  hypothesis  that  comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply  increases  activation  in  the  dmPFC,  a  region  associated with  mentalizing  processes,  and  in  the  bilateral  IFG  and  the  MTG, regions  associated  with  the  detection  of  non  literal  or  indirect meanings.  The  results  of  the  parametric  modulation  analysis  showed  a signiﬁcant  positive  correlation  only  in  the  left  precuneus  for  the indirect  reply  condition.  This  ﬁnding  indicates  that  the  activation  M.  Shibata  et  al.  /  Neuropsychologia  49 (2011) 3542–  3550  3547  Fig.  2.

Comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply  and  right  hemisphere activation  4.1.  Comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply  and  IFG  activation  The  present  study  showed  that  the  ventral  portion  of  the  IFG (BA  47)  was  activated  bilaterally  by  both  the  indirect  reply  and the  unconnected  sentence  condition.  In  contrast,  only  the  left  IFG (BA  45)  was  activated  in  the  literal  sentence  condition.  In  both the  indirect  reply  and  unconnected  sentence  conditions,  the  reply was  a  violation  of  the  relevance  maxim  and  was  not  related  to the  initial  remark.  This  violation  was  thought  to  be  the  cause  of the  activation  in  Brodmann’s  Area  47.  Brodmann’s  Area  47,  the lower  portion  of  the  inferior  frontal  gyrus  (pars  orbitals),  is  selectively  involved  in  processing  the  semantic  aspects  of  a  sentence, rather  than  syntactic  processing  (Bookheimer,  2002;  Dapretto  & Bookheimer,  1999;  Uchiyama  et  al.,  2008).  Previous  functional  neuroimaging  studies  have  reported  an  increased  BOLD  response  in the  IFG  during  the  following:  sentence  and  discourse  comprehension  (bilateral  IFG;  Dapretto  &  Bookheimer,  1999;  Kuperberg, Lakshmanan,  Caplan,  &  Holcomb,  2006;  Rodd,  Davis,  &  Johnsrude, 2005;  Zempleni,  Haverkort,  et  al.,  2007),  detection  of  semantic anomalies  (left  IFG;  Hagoort,  Hald,  Bastiaansen,  &  Petersson,  2004; Ni  et  al.,  2000),  following  presentation  of  an  ambiguous  statement  (bilateral  IFG;  Rodd  et  al.,  2005;  Zempleni,  Renken,  Hoeks, Hoogduin,  &  Stowe,  2007),  or  during  the  construction  of  a  situation model  (bilateral  IFG;  Ferstl,  Rinck,  &  von  Cramon,  2005;  Menenti, Petersson,  Scheeringa,  &  Hagoort,  2009).  On  the  basis  of  these  previous  studies,  our  results  suggest  that  semantic  processing  at  the sentence  level  is  related  to  bilateral  IFG  activation  (BA  47).  Both  the  left  and  right  IFG  (BA  47)  and  the  MTG   (BA  21)  were activated  in  the  indirect  reply  condition,  but  only  the  left  IFG  (BA 45)  and  the  MTG   (BA  21)  were  activated  in  the  literal  sentence condition.  Although  the  left  hemisphere  is  viewed  as  being  language  dominant,  a  number  of  fMRI  studies  have  reported  increased activation  in  right  hemispheric  brain  regions  during  language  comprehension.  Activation  of  the  right  hemisphere  seems  to  occur when  the  task  demands  are  increased  and  higher  level  language processing  is  required,  such  as  during  the  comprehension  of  semantically  ambiguous  sentences  or  pragmatic  speech  (Bottini  et  al., 1994;  Eviatar  &  Just,  2006;  Robertson  et  al.,  2000;  Rodd  et  al., 2005;  St  George,  Kutas,  Martinez,  &  Sereno,  1999;  Xu,  Kemeny, Park,  Frattali,  &  Braun,  2005;  Zempleni,  Renken,  et  al.,  2007). Moreover,  some  studies  have  shown  that  regions  in  the  right  hemisphere  are  sensitive  to  discourse  coherence  (Caplan  &  Dapretto, 2001;  Kuperberg  et  al.,  2006).  Kuperberg  et  al.  (2006)  investigated  causal  inferencing  across  three  types  of  sentence  scenarios: highly  causally  related,  moderately  related,  or  unrelated.  They found  that,  when  compared  with  moderately  related  sentences,  the right  IFG  (BA  47)  showed  stronger  responses  to  sentences  that  were unrelated  to  the  preceding  two-sentence  contexts.  These  ﬁndings suggest  that  the  right  IFG  may   play  an  initial  role  in  the  detection of  incoherence  within  discourse.  In  our  study,  the  indirect  reply was   out  of  context  and  elicited  higher  activation  in  the  bilateral IFG  and  the  MTG   (BA  47  and  21).  The  literal  sentence,  however, was   consistent  with  the  prior  context  and  elicited  higher  activation only  in  the  left  IFG  and  the  MTG   (BA  45  and  BA  21,  respectively).  3548  M.  Shibata  et  al.  /  Neuropsychologia  49 (2011) 3542–  3550  In  the  unconnected  sentence  conditions,  we  observed  bilateral  IFG (BA  47)  activation  but  not  dmPFC  activation.  The  target  stimuli  in the  unconnected  condition  were  completely  inconsistent  with  the prior  context,  and  they  neither  matched  the  situation  nor  conveyed any  related  meaning.  It  was  easier,  therefore,  to  detect  the  contextual  violation  in  the  unconnected  sentence  condition  than  in  the indirect  reply  condition.  Accordingly,  the  mean  reaction  time  for the  unconnected  sentence  condition  was  shorter  than  for  the  indirect  reply  condition.  This  result  suggests  that  participants  stopped attempting  to  understand  the  meaning  after  detecting  a  contextual violation.  Moreover,  some  previous  studies  have  proposed  models  for  the impact  of  emotional  information  on  the  activation  pattern  (Borod, Andelman,  Obler,  Tweedy,  &  Welkowitz,  1992;  Davidson,  Ekman, Saron,  Senulis,  &  Friesen,  1990;  Ross  &  Monnot,  2011).  However, our  results  showed  that  the  bilateral  frontal  regions  (especially  the ventral  portion  of  the  IFG,  BA  47)  were  activated  by  both  the  indirect reply  and  the  unconnected  sentence  condition.  In  the  unconnected sentence  condition,  the  stimulus  was  meaningless  and  was   not affected  by  emotional  valence.  That  is,  the  activation  pattern  cannot be  explained  only  by  the  involvement  of  an  emotional  factor.  In  consideration  of  these  results,  we  conclude  that  bilateral  IFG  and  MTG (BA  47  and  BA  21,  respectively)  activation  may   reﬂect  semantic processing  related  to  the  detection  of  contextual  violations.  These results  are  congruent  with  previous  neuropsychological  studies  in which  patients  with  right  hemisphere  damage  had  difﬁculty  assessing  their  scripts  of  world  knowledge  and  had  difﬁculty  with  the pragmatic  component.  4.3.  Comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply  and  activation  in  the dmPFC  We   found  greater  activation  for  the  comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply  than  for  literal  sentence  comprehension  in  the  dmPFC and  the  bilateral  IFG,  and  the  MTG   (Table  4  and  Fig.  2).  Many  studies have  implicated  the  dmPFC  in  higher  cognitive  functions,  including mentalizing,  self-knowledge,  social  knowledge,  action  monitoring, and  outcome  monitoring  (Amodio  &  Frith,  2006;  Gallagher  &  Frith, 2003).  Furthermore,  several  neuroimaging  studies  have  suggested that  the  dmPFC  may   play  a  role  in  comprehending  stories  that include  a  ToM  component  (Bird,  Castelli,  Malik,  Frith,  &  Husain, 2004;  Ferstl  &  von  Cramon,  2001,  2002),  and  that  include  the  discourse  coherence  (Ferstl  &  von  Cramon,  2001;  Kuperberg  et  al., 2006;  Ferstl,  Neumann,  Bogler,  &  von  Cramon,  2008).  Ferstl  and von  Cramon  (2002)  showed  that  the  dmPFC  establishes  a  pragmatic  connection  between  the  presented  sentences  and  is  thus important  for  coherence  processes  related  to  language  comprehension.  Other  studies  have  indicated  that  the  medial  frontal  cortex  is  involved  in  higher  level  language  comprehension,  and  activation  in  the  medial  frontal  cortex  has  been  associated  with  several aspects  of  pragmatic  comprehension,  including  plausibility  judgment  (Bottini  et  al.,  1994),  reasoning  (Goel,  Gold,  Kapur,  &  Houle, 1997),  coherence  judgment  (Ferstl  &  von  Cramon,  2002),  metaphor comprehension  (Shibata,  Abe,  Terao,  &  Miyamoto,  2007a,  2007b), and  self-referential  processing  (Gusnard,  Akbudak,  Shulman,  & Raichle,  2001).  In  the  present  study,  the  indirect  reply  was  out of  context,  whereas  the  literal  sentence  was   consistent  with  the prior  context.  Thus,  to  understand  these  inconsistent  statements, the  participant  was  required  to  infer  why   the  speaker  was  using non  literal  and  indirect  statements  and  establish  a  pragmatic  connection  between  the  presented  remarks.  In  accordance  with  these ideas,  our  results  found  an  involvement  of  the  dmPFC  in  mentalizing  processes,  such  as  determining  the  speaker’s  mental  state and  generating  inferences  to  make  sense  of  the  remarks  within  the context.  Our  experiment  also  required  the  participants  to  respond  by pressing  one  of  the  three  buttons  to  indicate  whether  the  stimulus  had  a  positive  connotation,  a  negative  connotation,  or  was meaningless.  These  judgment  processes  may   reﬂect  activation  in the  dmPFC.  In  the  indirect  reply  condition,  activation  in  the  medial frontal  cortex  covered  a  large  area  from  the  anterior  to  the  posterior region.  In  contrast,  in  the  literal  sentence  condition,  activation  in the  medial  frontal  cortex  was  localized  to  the  posterior  region.  Previous  studies  have  shown  strong  evidence  for  a  different  role  for the  anterior  region  in  comparison  to  the  posterior  medial  frontal cortex  (Grezes,  Frith,  &  Passingham,  2004;  Tamir  &  Mitchell,  2010; Walter  et  al.,  2004).  Amodio  and  Frith  (2006)  used  a  meta-analysis to  review  previous  research  that  reported  selective  activation  in  the medial  frontal  cortex  during  tasks  associated  with  action  monitoring,  outcome  monitoring,  self-knowledge,  person  perception,  and mentalizing.  They  reported  that  the  posterior  region  is  involved in  the  continuous  internal  monitoring  of  action  while  the  anterior  region  is  involved  in  self-knowledge,  person  perception,  and mentalizing  tasks.  In  accordance  with  their  study,  activation  in  the medial  frontal  cortex  (posterior  region)  due  to  literal  sentence  comprehension  might  be  related  to  action  monitoring  processes  (e.g., judging  whether  the  stimulus  had  a  positive  connotation,  a  negative  connotation,  or  was   meaningless).  In  contrast,  activation  in  the medial  frontal  cortex  (anterior  region)  due  to  comprehension  of  an indirect  reply  might  be  related  to  coherence  processes  that  establish  a  pragmatic  connection  between  the  presented  sentences  and the  mentalizing  process.  Regarding  the  activation  in  dmPFC,  it  is  undeniable  that  negative  emotion  affected  the  activation  of  the  region.  However,  some studies  have  indicated  that  not  only  negative  emotions  but  also  positive  emotions  selectively  affected  the  activation  of  these  regions  Table  4 Brain  regions  showing  signiﬁcant  BOLD  signal  increases  during  Indirect  reply  versus  Literal  sentence.

That  is,  the  activation  of  the  region  cannot  be  explained  only  by  the involvement  of  an  emotional  factor.  On  the  basis  of  these  ﬁndings, we  conclude  that  dmPFC  activation  may   reﬂect  cognitive  processes involved  in  comprehending  indirect  reply.  4.4.  Limitations  of  the  method  One  serious  limitation  of  this  study  is  the  task  effect  of  our  stimulus  materials.  In  our  experiment,  all  of  the  target  stimuli  in  the indirect  reply  condition  were  expressed  as  having  a  negative  connotation,  whereas  all  of  the  target  stimuli  in  the  literal  sentence condition  were  expressed  as  having  a  positive  connotation.  The participant  judged  whether  the  stimulus  had  a  positive  connotation or  a  negative  connotation.  Some  studies  reported  that  the  evaluation  of  the  emotional  state  inﬂuenced  the  activation  pattern  (Ferstl et  al.,  2005).  These  results  suggest  that  an  individual’s  emotional state  may   affect  activation  pattern.  Further  studies  are  needed  to clarify  the  relationship  between  emotional  factors  and  the  activation  pattern.  In  particular,  it  is  necessary  to  conduct  well-designed experiments  to  evaluate  how  emotional  processes  interact  with cognitive  processes.  Furthermore,  in  this  study  we  evaluated  neural  activity  associated  with  the  comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply;  we  did  not  focus on  the  other  types  of  indirect  speech  (e.g.,  request  or  question). Further  research  on  comprehension  processing  of  the  other  types of  indirect  speech  would  clarify  the  neural  mechanisms  associated with  the  comprehension  of  pragmatic  speech.  4.5.  Summary  and  conclusions  In  this  study  we  present  the  ﬁrst  neuroimaging  data  recorded during  the  comprehension  of  an  indirect  reply.  This  study  also supports  previous  patient-based  neuropsychological  studies,  suggesting  that  pragmatic  comprehension  is  associated  with  certain brain  regions  that  are  involved  in  mentalizing  and  semantic  processing,  such  as  the  dmPFC  and  the  bilateral  frontal  lobe.  These ﬁndings  integrate  and  extend  upon  previous  behavioral  and  neuropsychological  studies.  On  the  basis  of  our  data,  we  conclude  that the  right  and  left  IFG  and  the  MTG   play  a  crucial  role  in  detecting contextual  violations,  whereas  the  dmPFC  is  important  for  generating  inferences  to  make  sense  of  remarks  within  a  context.

Skerry1,* and Rebecca Saxe2 1Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA 2Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA *Correspondence: amy.skerry@gmail.com http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.009  SUMMARY  Research on emotion attribution has tended to focus on the perception of overt expressions of at most ﬁve or six basic emotions. However, our ability to identify others’ emotional states is not limited to perception of these canonical expressions. Instead, we make ﬁne-grained inferences about what others feel based on the situations they encounter, relying on knowledge of the eliciting conditions for different emotions. In the present research, we provide convergent behavioral and neural evidence concerning the representations underlying these concepts. First, we ﬁnd that patterns of activity in mentalizing regions contain information about subtle emotional distinctions conveyed through verbal descriptions of eliciting situations. Second, we identify a space of abstract situation features that well captures the emotion discriminations subjects make behaviorally and show that this feature space outperforms competing models in capturing the similarity space of neural patterns in these regions. Together, the data suggest that our knowledge of others’ emotions is abstract and high dimensional, that brain regions selective for mental state reasoning support relatively subtle distinctions between emotion concepts, and that the neural representations in these regions are not reducible to more primitive affective dimensions such as valence and arousal.  INTRODUCTION  Others’ emotional states can be identiﬁed by diverse cues including facial expressions [1], vocalizations [2], or body posture [3]. However, we can also attribute subtle emotions based solely on the situation a person encounters [4, 5], and our vocabulary for attributing these states extends beyond the emotions associated with canonical emotional displays [6]. While the space of emotions perceived in faces has been studied extensively [7–9], little is known about how conceptual knowledge of others’ emotions is organized, or how that knowledge is encoded in the human brain. What neural mechanisms underlie ﬁne-grained attributions (e.g., distinguishing when someone will feel angry versus disappointed)? Here, we suggest that emotion attribution  recruits a rich theory of the causal context of different emotions and show that dimensions of this intuitive knowledge underlie emotion representations in brain regions associated with theory of mind (ToM).  Previous research suggests that others’ emotions are represented at varying levels of abstraction throughout face-selective and ToM brain regions. For example, different facial expressions elicit discriminable patterns of activity in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and fusiform gyrus [10, 11]. In contrast, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) has been shown to contain representations of emotion that are invariant to perceptual modality [12, 13] and generalize to emotions inferred in the absence of any overt display [14]. However, all of these studies focused on coarse distinctions, decoding either valence [14] or ﬁve basic emotions [13]. Does the MPFC also support more ﬁne-grained emotional discriminations? To address this question, we constructed verbal stimuli (see Table 1) describing situations that would elicit 1 of 20 different emotions in a character (validated using 20-alternative-forced-choice [AFC] behavioral experiment with independent subjects; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and used multi-voxel pattern analysis [15] to test which regions contain information about these subtle emotional distinctions.  As a ﬁrst step, we trained a classiﬁer to distinguish the 20 emotions using distributed patterns of activity across voxels in a region and tested whether the emotion category of a new stimulus can be classiﬁed based on the pattern of neural activity it elicits. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we focused on a priori regions of interest (ROIs), the strongest candidates being subregions of MPFC—dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and middle medial prefrontal cortex (MMPFC) [13, 14]. We also tested other regions of the ToM network [16]: precuneus (PC), bilateral temporal parietal junction (TPJ), and right STS (RSTS).  We then used representational similarity analysis (RSA; [17]) to test competing hypotheses about the representational spaces in these regions. RSA complements classiﬁcation analyses by providing a framework for characterizing representational structure and for testing competing models of that structure [17, 18]. In RSA, neural population codes are represented in terms of the similarity of neural patterns elicited by different stimuli or conditions. A neural representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) of the conditions can then be compared to the similarity spaces captured by a number of different models [18, 19]. Importantly, RSA allows for comparison of hypotheses that take different forms and have different numbers of parameters. The correlation between model and neural RDMs has no free parameters, meaning that a model will not provide a better ﬁt to the data simply  Current Biology 25, 1945–1954, August 3, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1945  Table 1. Example Stimuli  Stimulus Type  Emotion  Physical pain  Example Stimulus  After an 18-hr ﬂight, Caitlin arrived at her vacation destination to learn that her baggage (including necessary camping gear for her trip) had not made the ﬂight. After waiting at the airport for two nights, Caitlin was informed that the airline had lost her luggage altogether and would not provide any compensation. For months, Naomi had been struggling to keep up with her various projects at work. One week, the company announced that they would be making massive payroll cuts. The next day, Naomi’s boss asked her to come into his ofﬁce and close the door behind her. Linda was having ﬁnancial difﬁculties after graduating from college. She worked overtime and lived very meagerly but still had trouble making her loan payments. One day, she received a letter from her grandfather saying that he wanted to help. A check for $8,000 was enclosed. Dana always wanted a puppy, but her parents said it was too much of a hassle. One summer afternoon, Dana’s parents returned from a supposed trip to the grocery store, and Dana heard barking from inside her garage. She opened the door to see her parents holding a golden retriever puppy.  One afternoon, Caitlin was running through her house while playing tag with her friend. After going through a doorway, Caitlin slammed the door behind her, but her ﬁngers were caught in the door. When they opened the door, two of her ﬁngers were broken.  All experiments used the same set of 200 verbal stimuli in which a character experienced 1 of 20 different emotions (validated with 20-AFC experiment on MTurk), conveyed via a description of an emotion-eliciting event (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).  because it is higher dimensional. Thus, RSA can go beyond classiﬁcation to test speciﬁc alternative models of the dimensions that structure the representation of others’ emotions.  Candidate Feature Spaces for Emotion Inference Research in affective neuroscience has typically examined representations involved in both ﬁrst-person emotional experience and emotional face perception. Here, we address a different question, concerning observers’ inferences about others’ emotions. Nevertheless, it is plausible that intuitive theories of emotion are fairly veridical (in order to be maximally useful in social interactions) and even informed by one’s own emotional experiences. Therefore, models of the structure of ﬁrst-person emotional experience may also capture the basis for third-person emotion attribution. We drew from prior literature on emotional experience three alternative models of the representational space of emotions.  A dominant approach has been to represent emotions as combinations of more basic affective states. According to basic emotion theory, complex and subtle emotions can be understood as combinations of 5–6 basic emotional states, each associated with a prototypical facial expression and innate neural substrate [1, 20, 21]. A second theory is the ‘‘circumplex’’ model, which posits that emotions are composed of only two primitive  dimensions—valence and arousal [9, 22, 23]—corresponding to two innate systems implemented in distinct neural circuits and recruited to varying degrees across different emotions [24–26]. In this view, neural representations of emotion may be reduced to a linear combination of these two neurophysiological dimensions [27].  Although many have focused on the differences between these two proposals [28, 29], both aim to represent emotions in terms of combinations of a small number of basic affective states, rooted in innate neural substrates. An alternative approach in affective science, termed ‘‘appraisal theory,’’ aims to instead characterize emotions in terms of people’s interpretations or ‘‘appraisals’’ of the events around them [30, 31]. Researchers have proposed speciﬁc sets of event appraisals that correspond to different emotions (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for further details) and shown that these features capture differences in the emotions subjects experience across different situations [32, 33].  All three of these theories have shown some utility in characterizing ﬁrst-person emotional experiences. Here, we investigated whether any of these approaches successfully capture subjects’ intuitive attributions of others’ emotions and whether they could explain the representational spaces in MPFC and other ToM regions. If people reason about others’ emotions using an intuitive causal theory (embedded in a larger intuitive ToM), this theory should capture regularities in the situations that cause different emotions. Thus, we hypothesized that the representations involved in inferring the emotions of others, especially based on short verbal narratives, would be better captured by abstract event features than by combinations of basic emotional dimensions.  We therefore used RSA to determine whether representations in regions that discriminate our 20 categories are best captured by one of three candidate spaces (see Figure 2): a ‘‘circumplex’’ space deﬁned by independent subjects’ judgments (Amazon Mechanical Turk [MTurk]; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) of valence and arousal for each stimulus, a ‘‘basic emotion’’ space deﬁned by judgments of the extent to which the stimulus elicited each of six basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, afraid, disgusted, or surprised), and a space of abstract event features derived from appraisal theory. For this third model, we generated a set of 38 event features thought to reliably vary across different emotion concepts (e.g., ‘‘Did someone cause this situation intentionally, or did it occur by accident?’’; See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for appraisal features and selection process). Importantly, the latter space differs from the other two not only in its dimensionality (38 dimensions versus 6 or 2) but also in its content: rather than reducing the space of emotions to a smaller set of purportedly ‘‘basic’’ affective states, it aims to encode emotions in terms of abstract features of the causal contexts that tend to elicit them. To test which feature space best explains the neural representation of these stimuli, we computed the similarity of emotion conditions within each proposed feature space and compared the RDMs of candidate models to neural RDMs derived from patterns of activity across voxels in each ROI.  Of course, the hypothesis that neural representations of emotion concepts are best captured by a high-dimensional space of abstract event features is not incompatible with the  1946 Current Biology 25, 1945–1954, August 3, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved  Figure 1.

MPFC and other ToM regions in individual subjects (see Figure S1). We selected a subset of conditions that most closely align with the positive and negative conditions used previously [14] and tested whether neural patterns in MPFC would support decoding of valence. Replicating prior work, classiﬁcation of valence was reliably above chance in both DMPFC (M(SEM) = 0.610(0.028), t(19) = 3.889, p < 0.001) and MMPFC (0.603(0.019), t(19) = 5.530, p < 0.001).  claim that simpler dimensions like valence and arousal contribute to the organization of our emotion knowledge. For example, we included features such as goal consistency and pleasantness that intuitively relate to the dimension of valence. The question, then, is whether the representations in regions like MPFC can be exhausted by one of the simpler spaces. With this approach, we show that it is possible to characterize the ﬁne-grained representational structure of a high-level human reasoning capacity like emotion attribution.  RESULTS  Classiﬁcation In the scanner, subjects (n = 22) read 200 stimuli describing situations that would cause a particular emotion (see Experimental Procedures; example stimuli provided in Table 1). To conﬁrm that these stimuli elicit reliable ﬁne-grained emotion attributions, a group of subjects on MTurk were asked to choose which of 20 emotion labels best described the emotion of the character in each stimulus. These subjects performed well above chance (relative to the intended emotion), classifying the stimuli with 65% accuracy (chance = 5%; Figure 1C; see Supplemental Information for evidence that subjects attribute consistent emotions). This classiﬁcation accuracy provided a benchmark with which to compare different models and brain regions.  To identify regions in which neural patterns contain information about emotions, we ﬁrst replicated the ﬁnding that MPFC contains abstract emotion representations by testing whether neural patterns in MPFC could distinguish the valence in single trial estimates of these verbal stimuli. We functionally localized  We then investigated whether these or other regions contain information about the full set of 20 emotions. A whole-brain searchlight revealed that the set of regions that could reliably decode the 20 emotions was largely restricted to regions of the ToM network (particularly DMPFC, RTPJ, LTPJ; see Figure 1B and Table S1). The searchlight analysis exhibited striking overlap with the set of regions recruited for ToM (Figure 1B shows overlap between the searchlight [family-wise error, FWE p < .05, k > 25] and the random effects analysis of false belief > false photograph from the localizer task, shown at p < .001 uncorrected) and justiﬁed our continued focus on these a priori ROIs. Consistent with the searchlight results, we were able to classify emotions with above-chance accuracy (1 out of 20 emotions, 5%) based on neural patterns in all individually localized ToM regions (Figure 1A; Table S2). Because these analyses involved training and testing across stimulus items, above-chance classiﬁcation indicates a representation of emotion that generalizes across otherwise highly variable verbal scenarios.  Moreover, in the judgments provided by subjects on MTurk, there were reliable differences across the emotion categories in the extent to which subjects provided the expected emotion label (one-way ANOVA: F(19,180) = 4.99, p < 0.001; see Figure 1C), which provided another signature with which to compare neural representations. We computed separate accuracies for each emotion category in each ROI and correlated these with the behavioral emotion labeling accuracies. In all ROIs, the accuracy of neural classiﬁcations for different emotions was signiﬁcantly correlated with the accuracy levels observed in the emotion judgments of the MTurk behavioral raters (see Table S2; see Figure 1D). Thus, the reliable across-emotion accuracy differences observed behaviorally were paralleled in the emotion-speciﬁc  Current Biology 25, 1945–1954, August 3, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1947  Figure 2.

RSA Representational similarity analyses were then used to test speciﬁc hypotheses about the structure of the representations in these regions. We generated three competing feature spaces using independent behavioral ratings (Figure 2A) and tested which feature space could best capture the neural representation of the 20 emotions. We ﬁrst analyzed the behavioral data alone, assessing the extent to which emotion categories could be reliably classiﬁed based on feature vectors in each of these candidate spaces. Speciﬁcally, we tested whether models trained on each of the feature vectors for a subset of stimuli could reliably classify the emotion label of untrained stimuli (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Do any of these feature spaces provide a stimulus representation sufﬁcient to match the performance of human subjects in discriminating these 20 emotions (65%)? We found that although all three feature spaces classiﬁed well above a chance level of 5%, the appraisal feature space outperformed the other lower-dimensional spaces (57%, compared to behavioral benchmark of 65%; see Figure 2B; note because we used cross-validated accuracy, this analysis is not biased by the dimensionality of the models). Using a paired samples t test across individual items, we found that the abstract appraisal space performed reliably better than the circumplex space (t(199) = 8.288, p < 0.001) and the basic emotion space (t(199) = 2.176, p = 0.031).  RDMs derived from these three feature spaces were then compared to neural RDMs in each region to identify the space that best accounts for the similarity of the emotion conditions in their neural patterns. Because the appraisal RDM could perform best simply because it better discriminates the 20 emotions, we compared its performance to that of a pure categorical  model and an RDM deﬁned from the behavioral confusion matrix (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), both of which also successfully discriminate the emotions (Figure 3). We also tested a model in which condition similarity is deﬁned in terms of similarity of word-frequency vectors, a representation frequently used in fully automated approaches to emotional text classiﬁcation such as sentiment analysis of reviews or other social media [34, 35]. Does the appraisal space outperform a raw word-level representation of the stimuli? Finally, we tested three control spaces capturing possible lower-level dimensions: reading ease, syntactic complexity, and rated intensity (confounded with motor (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).  response)  For each region, we correlated RDMs for the competing feature spaces to neural RDMs from individual ROIs (distances of the 20 emotions in their voxel-wise patterns). In the two MPFC subregions, the similarity of emotion conditions in voxellevel patterns was positively correlated with similarity in the space of 38 appraisal dimensions (group-level Kendall’s tau, DMPFC: 0.28; MMPFC: 0.21). Correlations with individual subject neural RDMs revealed a reliable relationship between the neural and model RDMs (see Table 2; Figure 4). In both DMPFC and MMPFC, the neural similarities were more correlated with the appraisal space than with either basic or circumplex spaces (see Table 3). In both regions, the appraisal RDM also outperformed the categorical and confusion spaces, suggesting that the superior performance of this model cannot be fully explained by its ability to better differentiate the 20 emotions. The appraisal space also outperformed the RDM deﬁned from word-token frequencies and the control spaces for reading ease, syntactic complexity, and intensity (see Table 3).  We conducted the same analyses in the remaining ToM regions (RTPJ, LTPJ, PC, RSTS, and VMPFC): neural representations in these ROIs were also reliably correlated with the  1948 Current Biology 25, 1945–1954, August 3, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved  Figure 3. RSA Methods Representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) encode the pairwise Euclidean distances between different emotions within each feature space. For each region, a neural RDM captures the pairwise Euclidean distances between different emotions in the patterns of activity elicited across voxels (DMPFC shown here). Feature spaces are ﬁt to the neural data by computing correlations between feature space RDMs and neural RDMs for each region in each subject. In addition to the three candidate theories, we also test confusion and categorical spaces. Given that the appraisal space best captures the distinctions between the 20 emotions, it could outperform simpler models simply by virtue of its superior emotion discrimination. To test this possibility, we compare the appraisal space to a pure categorical RDM, which assumes that all emotions are perfectly and equally discriminable. As a more conservative test, we compute the correlation between neural RDMs and the raw behavioral confusion matrix. Like the categorical model, this confusion RDM captures the distinctions between the 20 emotions but also encodes similarity between different emotions as reﬂected in the behavioral confusions. the appraisal space outperforms these two models, it suggests that the appraisal space ﬁts the neural data in virtue of the features rather than emotion discriminability alone.  If  appraisal space RDM (see Figure 4 for RTPJ; see Figure S3 for results from other ToM regions), and no region was reliably more correlated with the basic emotion or circumplex spaces. The 38-dimensional space outperformed competing spaces in all ToM regions except for VMPFC (where the best-performing space was the word-frequency representation). However, DMPFC and MMPFC were the only regions in which the highdimensional space signiﬁcantly outperformed all models.  Region Contributions We could reliably decode emotions in all ToM ROIs, and the appraisal space did the best job of capturing the neural similarity space in most regions. Is the same information represented redundantly, or might these regions contribute differently to the representation of emotions? When classifying only valence, a model trained with voxels from all ToM ROIs (M(SEM) = 0.581(0.016), t(21) = 4.942, p < 0.001) performed less well than a model trained only with voxels in DMPFC (58.1% relative to 61%). However, when classifying the full set of 20 emotions, a model trained with voxels from all regions outperformed any of the individual ROIs, raising the possibility of non-redundant information across ToM regions.  To test for possible representational differences across the ROIs, we ﬁrst used an iterative split-half reliability analysis (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We found that neu ral RDMs in DMPFC and RTPJ were more correlated with themselves than (Mwithin = 0.178, with the other ROI Mbetween = 0.164, p < 0.001) and that this effect was not observed between MMPFC and RTPJ (Mwithin = 0.121, Mbetween = 0.123, p < 0.922). To further characterize potential non-redundancy, we explored whether the regions differed in the particular situation features they represent. Rather than compute separate RDMs for each of 38 appraisal features, we identiﬁed a reduced set of ten features that captured the most unique variance in behavioral ratings across items, using a stepwise regression approach (see Figures S2 and S4; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We then computed the RDMs for this ten-dimensional space and also for each of the ten features individually and correlated each with the neural RDMs in different regions. The neural RDMs in all regions were reliably correlated with the RDM of the ten-feature space (see Table 2; Figure S4), which appears to capture much of the representational structure of the initial 38-dimensional space (Figure S2). Consistent with the results above, a repeatedmeasures ANOVA on the neural-model correlations for each feature (with ROI and feature as within-subjects factors) revealed a signiﬁcant ROI 3 feature interaction for the comparison of DMPFC and RTPJ (F(9,171) = 2.06, p = 0.036), but not between MMPFC and RTPJ (F(9,171) = 1.036, p = 0.414). Together, these results provide evidence that multiple ToM regions are involved in the attribution of emotion and that some of these regions may contribute unique information to the ﬁnal representational space that governs behavior.

DISCUSSION  Decades of research in the science of emotion have aimed to characterize emotions in terms of some low-dimensional space of basic affective primitives [1, 23, 27, 36]. Behaviorally, we ﬁnd that a space of abstract event features, derived from work in appraisal theory [33], reliably outperforms these simpler spaces in discriminating the 20 different emotions in our stimuli. Consistent with previous reports [13, 14], we ﬁnd that neural representations in MPFC contain information about attributed emotions. Whereas prior studies focused on coarse distinctions (e.g., valence), we classify a set of nuanced emotions at abovechance levels. Moreover, by expanding to a rich space of eliciting situations, we are able to decode attributed emotions in all regions of the ToM network, and the searchlight results suggest that this information is largely restricted to these regions (particularly MPFC, RTPJ, and LTPJ).  Although these classiﬁcations are reliably above chance (5%), they are far from reaching the accuracy observed behaviorally (65%). This discrepancy between neural and behavioral classiﬁcation could arise because the population code in these regions is insufﬁcient to explain the behavior and/or because single trial estimates of fMRI data provide a noisy, blurred measurement of the underlying neural code. However, across different emotions, there are reliable correlations in the average accuracy of the neural populations and of independent behavioral ratings, providing support for the role of these regions in emotion attribution behaviors.  The present work also probes the underlying representational structure that supports emotion discrimination. Previous literature [12–14] is consistent with the possibility that MPFC codes a limited space of affective dimensions such as valence and/or arousal. Moreover, even in our neural classiﬁcation analyses, a region could support 20-way classiﬁcation at abovechance levels by coding only a single dimension or feature that varies across emotions. Using RSA, we ﬁnd not only that brain regions involved in ToM reasoning contain information about attributed emotions but also that this information is best captured by the high-dimensional space of event features.  In the majority of ToM regions, the similarity of emotion conditions in their voxel response patterns is most correlated with the similarity of the emotions in the space of appraisals. This result suggests a neural code that does not reduce to a simpler  set of distinctions, such as valence and arousal, and provides novel insight into the granularity of the emotion representations in MPFC and other ToM regions. Together, the data suggest that human emotion attribution is organized around abstract features of the causal context in which different emotions occur rather than the affective primitives that have dominated prior research.  A challenge for future work will be characterizing the scope and speciﬁcity of the neural representations in ToM regions. Do these neural populations contain representations speciﬁc to attributed emotion, coded within a space of emotion-relevant event features, or contain information in the form of domain-general semantic representations used in the service of emotion attribution? It is quite possible that these event representations function as intermediate features in the service of diverse inferential processes in addition to emotion attribution. Ultimately, successfully inferring emotions depends on a rich body of world knowledge, and neural populations speciﬁc to social cognition must interface with more general-purpose semantic systems. Characterizing information ﬂow within and between these different networks will be an important avenue for future research.  Characterizing Representational Spaces To characterize the feature space that governs representation of attributed emotion in the human brain, we draw on methods that have been fruitful in recent research on visual object recognition and object semantics, where researchers have tested a range of high-level and low-level features that could capture neural similarity of different objects [18, 37–39]. In one study, Mitchell and colleagues [38] coded object words in terms of co-occurrence with a set of verbs hypothesized to pick out relevant semantic dimensions (e.g., ‘‘manipulate,’’ ‘‘taste’’), a representation that was sufﬁcient to support neural classiﬁcation of untrained stimuli. Later work showed that a corpus-based co-occurrence space is outperformed by a space derived from behavioral ratings on a set of a priori object properties (e.g., is it alive?) [40]. The present research is most similar to this second approach, relying on behavioral ratings of a set of hypothesized event features. We show that is possible to generate candidate representational spaces for domains of high-level cognition such as emotion inference and to use these spaces to characterize patterns of activity in ToM brain regions.  it  The study of object representation has also made headway on understanding differences across regions and temporal stages [37, 39], with RSA in particular providing a ﬂexible framework for comparing the structure of the representations along the ventral pathway [41]. Interestingly, the present results provide preliminary evidence that ToM regions (particularly DMPFC versus RTPJ) may differ in their contributions to emotion inference. Further work is needed to characterize the precise computational roles of these regions and how they interact with other networks to form a processing stream.  As has been the case in research on object representation, we assume that future studies of emotion attribution will yield stimulus representations that outperform the 38-dimensional space explored here. Many early approaches to modeling neural object representations involved hand-picked features (e.g., 25 verbs)  1950 Current Biology 25, 1945–1954, August 3, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved  Figure 4. RSA Results Mean correlation (Kendall’s tau) between candidate model RDMs and individual subject neural RDMs (±SEM across subjects). Dotted line shows the noise ceiling (see Table S3).  proved useful in the present paradigm, it is unlikely that representations in domains of high-level cognition such as ToM can be reduced to operations over lists of associated features [45]. For example, an attributed emotion depends critically on the temporal and causal order of the different elements of the event (e.g., eating a whole cake and then swearing to keep to your diet versus swearing to keep your diet and then eating a whole cake). To capture the causal and compositional nature of emotion inference [4], future research may need to incorporate structured, generative knowledge representations from other areas of cognitive science [46]. The present ﬁndings lay groundwork for such research by providing an initial sketch of speciﬁc dimensions that might structure human emotion concepts and a framework for evaluating competing models of this knowledge.  [38] and often manual coding of stimuli within those spaces [37, 42]. However, recent research using high-throughput, datadriven approaches has yielded computational models that can be applied to raw stimuli (i.e., images) and achieve high quantitative ﬁt to neural patterns [43]. Here, candidate features were selected based on prior theories without subsequent optimization (this list may therefore contain redundant or uninformative features, and some additional features are likely necessary), and the stimuli required manual annotation (MTurk ratings). In fact, the model using 38 abstract event features falls short of human behavioral performance when labeling stimuli (57% versus 65% accurate), indicating that this collection of features does not completely capture intuitive emotion knowledge. A data-driven discovery method might be better able to capture the full range of relevant dimensions; future research would ideally identify new sets of optimized features (either event features or some other candidate basis) and ways to infer these features directly from text.  A second, more fundamental limitation is that this approach aims to encode human emotion knowledge in terms of lists of appraisal checks applied to each stimulus. While this ﬂat feature vector approach has been productive in other domains [44] and  Conclusions Despite important open questions, the present data provide novel insight into the representations underlying human emotion inference and the neural populations that support them. We show that it is possible to decode attributed emotions from neural patterns in regions involved in mental state reasoning and provide quantitative insight into the underlying representational structure that supports this inferential ability. Together, the results suggest that our knowledge of others’ emotions is abstract and high dimensional, that brain regions associated with emotion perception and inference contain information about relatively ﬁne-grained emotional distinctions, and that the neural representations in these regions are not reducible to more primitive affective primitives such as valence and arousal.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Further details on experimental procedures (e.g., ROI selection and univariate analyses) are provided in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.  Behavioral Feature Ratings A separate set of MTurk subjects (n = 250) provided ratings (1–10 scale) for each of the stimuli on each of the features of the three competing feature spaces (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). A given subject rated stimuli on either features from the abstract event space (e.g., ‘‘Did someone cause this situation intentionally, or did it occur by accident?’’; see Feature Table in Supplemental Information) or dimensions corresponding to the basic emotion space (e.g., ‘‘Was <character> happy in this situation?’’)  Current Biology 25, 1945–1954, August 3, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1951  Table 3.

Feature-Based Classiﬁcation of Behavioral Data To test whether any of the three candidate spaces (basic emotion, circumplex, and 38 appraisals) capture the full range of attributed emotions, we created an item-by-feature matrix for each possible space and tested whether a model (linear support vector machine [SVM]) trained on these features could classify the 20 distinct emotions (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We tested whether each feature space provided a basis for emotion discrimination that generalized across the different exemplars by using item-based crossvalidation folds and computing the average cross-item classiﬁcation accuracy for each feature space (comparing to the behavioral benchmark: 65%).  fMRI Emotion Attribution Task In the emotion attribution task, subjects viewed 200 emotion stimuli, along with ten stories describing physical pain [47]. The experiment consisted of ten runs (7.37 min/run), each containing one exemplar for each of 21 trial types (20 emotion conditions, 1 pain). Each story was presented at ﬁxation for 13 s, followed by a 2 s window for a behavioral response. Subjects were instructed to press a button to indicate the intensity of the character’s experience (1 to 4, neutral to extreme), which focused subjects’ attention on the character’s emotional state but ensured that behavioral responses (intensity) were orthogonal to discriminations of interest. The stories were presented in a jittered, event-related design, with a central ﬁxation cross presented between trials at a variable inter-stimulus interval of 3-5-7 s. The order of conditions was counterbalanced across runs and participants, and order of individual stories for each condition was randomized.  fMRI Analyses Acquisition and preprocessing details are provided in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.  MPFC could reliably classify the valence of these stimuli. We then tested whether voxel patterns in MPFC or other ToM regions could reliably classify the set of 20 emotions.  We conducted MVPA within ROIs that were functionally deﬁned based on individual subject localizer scans (including a ToM network ROI deﬁned as the union of each subject’s individually localized ROIs). We computed a single voxel pattern for each individual trial by averaging the preprocessed bold images for the trial and Z scoring relative to the mean across all trial responses in each voxel. The data were classiﬁed using a support vector machine; this classiﬁer uses condition-labeled training data to learn a weight for each voxel, and subsequent stimuli can then be assigned to one of two classes based on a weighted linear combination of the responses in each voxel. For the 20-way discrimination, multi-class classiﬁcation was conducted with a one-versusone method [48]. Classiﬁcation accuracy was averaged across ten cross-validation folds to yield a score for each subject per ROI, assessed with a onesample t test (one tailed) over individual accuracies (comparing to chance: 0.5 for positive versus negative; 0.05 for 20-way classiﬁcation). See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for further details.  RSA To create RDMs for the competing representational spaces, we ﬁrst averaged the feature vectors (from MTurk ratings) for each emotion condition (across stimuli), yielding the emotion-by-feature matrices shown in Figure 2. For each matrix, we then computed the Euclidean distance of feature vectors for each pair of emotions. We conducted this analysis iteratively (n = 1,000) across split halves of the data (ﬁve items per condition in each half), such that the selfdistances along the diagonal are meaningful. In addition to the ﬁve candidate feature spaces (circumplex, basic emotions, appraisals, confusions, and categorical), we generated an additional space deﬁned in terms of the similarity in word occurrences across stimuli, as well as additional control spaces to conﬁrm that neural RDMs could not be explained in terms of lower-level properties of the stimuli: reading ease, syntactic complexity, and behavioral ratings of intensity (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).  Neural RDMs were computed separately for each region in each subject with the same procedure as for feature space RDMs, except that features were voxel-wise neural responses rather than behavioral ratings (see Supplemental Information). We computed similarity of the conditions (Euclidean distance) in their voxel patterns (conducted across even and odd subsets so that the diagonal is interpretable), yielding an RDM for each region. To compare neural and model similarity spaces, we then computed the rank correlation (Kendall’s tau-a) between the model and neural RDMs for each region in each subject and compared these correlations to chance (average Kendall’s tau = 0) with a Wilcoxon test. We also compared the ﬁt of different models by conducting a one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the correlations for different pairs of models.

Luan Phan, Daniel A. Fitzgerald, Pradeep J. Nathan, Gregory J. Moore, Thomas W. Uhde, and Manuel E. Tancer  Background: Successful control of affect partly depends on the capacity to modulate negative emotional responses through the use of cognitive strategies. Although the capacity to regulate emotions is critical to mental well-being, its neural substrates remain unclear. Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to ascertain brain regions involved in the voluntary regulation of emotion and whether dynamic changes in negative emotional experience can modulate their activation. Fourteen healthy subjects were scanned while they either maintained the negative affect evoked by highly arousing and aversive pictures (e.g., experience naturally) or suppressed their affect using cognitive reappraisal. In addition to a condition-based analysis, online subjective ratings of intensity of negative affect were used as covariates of brain activity. Results: Inhibition of negative affect was associated with activation of dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsal medial prefrontal, and lateral prefrontal cortices, and attenuation of brain activity within limbic regions (e.g., nucleus accumbens/extended amygdala). Furthermore, activity within dorsal anterior cingulate was inversely related to intensity of negative affect, whereas activation of the amygdala was positively covaried with increasing negative affect. Conclusions: These findings highlight a functional dissociation of corticolimbic brain responses, involving enhanced activation of prefrontal cortex and attenuation of limbic areas, during volitional suppression of negative emotion.  Key Words: Amygdala, cognition, emotion, emotion regulation, fMRI, prefrontal cortex  H uman survival depends largely on the unique capacity to  perceive accurately and react appropriately to emotionally salient cues. It has been conjectured that emotions are based on motivational mechanisms that serve to guide adaptive behavioral responses (Darwin 1872/1965; James 1894). The most influential models of emotional processing posit that emotion is a transient, reflexive, and prepotent response to a salient, “exciting” stimulus that elicits a subjective affective experience (James 1894; Lazarus 1991). Animal, human neuropsychologic, and functional imaging studies provide partial support for the existence of a dedicated “emotion” circuit within the brain (Damasio 1994; Davidson and Irwin 1999; LeDoux 1996; Phan et al 2002). The amygdala, extended amygdala/ ventral striatum (including nucleus accumbens [NAcc]), insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are often considered key neural substrates of this emotion processing circuit. Emotion processing not only involves detection and evaluation of salient stimuli, however, but also the experience and regulation of the subsequent affective response (Phillips et al 2003a). Delineating how these regions are involved in emotion regulation is important to advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms of emotion and psychopathology (Phillips et al 2003b).

Indeed, in the face of negative events, we humans have the distinctive capacity to regulate our emotions to lessen and cope with distress. Negative emotions that are exaggerated or become dysregulated (or both) can lead to vulnerability toward pathologic anxiety and mood (Critchley 2003; Davidson 2002; Mayberg 2003). Preliminary evidence regarding the neurobiological basis of this adaptive process derives from studies in patients with prefrontal brain lesions (particularly in the ventral– orbital frontal cortex), which consequently manifest in affective instability and impulsive aggression (Damasio 1994; Davidson et al 2000; Nauta 1971). In addition, findings from the cognitive neurosciences have helped advance our understanding of the neural basis of affective regulation. The most influential neurobiological model for the cognitive control of behavior implicate the dorsal regions of the frontal cortex (dorsal ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]; Miller and Cohen 2001). For example, functional imaging of Go/No-Go and Stroop interference tasks that require subjects to restrain prepotent responses consistently show recruitment of dorsal ACC and DLPFC (Braver et al 2001; Garavan et al 2002; Konishi et al 1999). If emotional responses to salient stimuli can be regarded as reflexive in nature, then conscious attempts to regulate these responses may also engage brain regions generally responsible for cognitive control of behavior. imaging provides additional clues toward elucidating the neural correlates of cognitive influences on the emotion control. First, the mere presence of cognitive effort can both augment activity within dorsal frontal regions and attenuate limbic (e.g., amygdala) responses during emotional evocation (Hariri et al 2000; Liberzon et al 2000; Taylor et al 2003). Second, voluntary self-regulation of sexual (Beauregard et al 2001) and autonomic (Critchley et al 2002) arousal increases activity within the dorsal ACC while dampening activation of the amygdala (Beauregard et al 2001). Third, and more directly, two studies to date have examined the neural  Recently emerging evidence from functional  BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2005;57:210 –219 © 2005 Society of Biological Psychiatry  K.L. Phan et al  BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2005;57:210 –219 211  correlates of voluntary suppression of negative emotions. Ochsner and colleagues (2002) were the first to report that the use of cognitive strategies (e.g., reappraisal) to reframe stimuli that evoked negative feelings in unemotional terms evoked greater activation of dorsal ACC, dorsal MPFC (DMPFC), and DLPFC and suppressed activity in the amygdala and medial OFC. In a subsequent study by Levesque et al (2003), suppression of sadness (evoked by films) via an alternative cognitive strategy (e.g., detachment) resulted in activations within the right OFC, the DLPFC, and, less consistently, the dorsal ACC. Coupled with support from electrophysiologic and behavioral studies on emotion regulation (Gross 1999; Jackson et al 2000), these findings provide support for the feasibility of voluntary self-regulation of affective experience and of studying the neural basis of this process with brain imaging.  This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and employed a similar “emotion regulation” paradigm as that of Ocshner and colleagues (2002) to explore the neural substrates mediating voluntary suppression of negative emotion. We employed reliable probes of negative emotion and limbic activation (e.g., highly arousing and aversive pictures; Lang et al 1997; Phan et al 2002) and used a well-validated task in which subjects were trained either to maintain or suppress voluntarily their negative reactions during blocks of these evocative stimuli (Jackson et al 2000; Ochsner et al 2002). We sought to extend the prior findings by the inclusion of male participants, change of the design to a block (versus event-related) format, and analysis of brain activity in relation to subject-specific behavioral data. In particular, to account for intra- and interindividual differences in how well each subject regulated their affective state, we acquired online subjective ratings of intensity of negative emotion following each block and used these ratings as parametric covariates in our subsequent analysis (Phan et al 2003; Winston et al 2002). Based on prior findings on cognitive control and emotion processing in general, we predicted that volitional inhibition of negative emotion would enhance activity within discrete cortical structures (dorsal ACC, DLPFC, OFC) and attenuate activity within subcortical (amygdala, extended amygdala) and paralimbic (insular cortex) brain regions. Consequently, these areas represented regions of interest (ROIs) in our statistical analysis.  Methods and Materials  Subjects  Fourteen healthy, right-handed subjects (6 men, aged 22–38 years, mean 27.6 ⫾ 4.4 years) participated in the study. The participants had normal or corrected-normal vision and were without a history of psychiatric or neurologic illness, as verified by a semistructured clinical interview. All subjects gave written informed consent after explanation of the experimental protocol, as approved by the Wayne State University School of Medicine’s Human Investigation Committee.  Stimuli and Behavioral Protocol  The stimulus set consisted of 40 highly aversive and arousing pictures based on normative ratings from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al 1997) and five blank (BL) gray-scale images with a centered fixation cross. The mean (⫾ SD) valence and arousal values on a 9-point scale for the pictures were 2.03 ⫾ .44 and 6.03 ⫾ .72, respectively (1 ⫽ most unpleasant/least arousing, 9 ⫽ most pleasant/most arousing). The pictures were transformed to gray-scale using Adobe Photoshop 7 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, California). The pictures  elicit both evaluation and experience of negative affect (Lang et al 1993) and generally depict complex scenes of burn victims, funeral scenes, people crying, and dead animals. Of note, the pictures selected for the two experimental conditions (described later) were matched for general content, including faces and figures, and were balanced on subjective valence and arousal (t test, p ⬎ .5). Prior studies have demonstrated the reliability of these emotionally salient pictures to consistently evoke negative emotions and activations in limbic and paralimbic brain regions (Phan et al 2002). Stimuli were presented through magneticresonance-compatible liquid crystal display goggles (Resonance Technology, Northridge, California).  The emotion regulation protocol employed two main conditions of interest, Maintain or Suppress, serving as control and experimental tasks, respectively. On Maintain (M) blocks, subjects were instructed to attend to, be aware of, and experience naturally (without trying to change or alter) the emotional state elicited by the pictures; they were told to maintain the evoked affect for the entire block. On Suppress (S) blocks, subjects were instructed to decrease voluntarily the intensity of their negative affect by using the cognitive strategy of reappraisal (Gross 1999; originally pioneered by the work of Lazarus 1991), which is to reinterpret the content of the picture so that it no longer elicited a negative response. During the hour prior to scanning, participants received extensive instruction on cognitive reappraisal from a trained psychiatrist (KLP). Two main examples of cognitive reappraisal were provided to facilitate understanding of the strategy: 1) transforming the scenario depicted into positive terms (e.g., women crying outside of a church could be alternatively interpreted as expressing tears of joy from wedding ceremony rather than of sorrow from a funeral) and 2) rationalizing or objectifying the content of the pictures (e.g., a woman with facial bruises could be translated as an actor wearing makeup rather than a victim of domestic abuse). Pilot testing in our and other laboratories (Jackson et al 2000; Ochsner et al 2002) have suggested that these two types of reappraisal strategies are frequently used and often successful in volitional suppression of the negative emotions evoked by aversive IAPS pictures. Although we provided examples for illustrative purposes, we informed subjects that no single type of reinterpretation was universally applicable to all pictures, as in real life, and that they were to use the most effective reframing strategy for each picture. The training session included interactive instruction with the psychiatrist to ensure that subjects could reappraise the pictures quickly and effectively as well as practice trials with sample aversive pictures (not shown during scanning). Participants were instructed not to look away (unless necessary) or distract themselves with irrelevant thoughts. Subjects confirmed their understanding of the instructions and reappraisal strategy prior to scanning, as evidenced by their ability to provide explicit, detailed verbal descriptions of the techniques they would use to modulate their emotional experience.  Participants were scanned while performing the following behavioral protocol (Figure 1). Subjects viewed 20-sec blocks of aversive pictures; each picture was presented for 4 sec consecutively without an interstimulus interval. Prior to each block of pictures, the instruction to “MAINTAIN” or “SUPPRESS” appeared at the center of a gray screen below a fixation cross for a duration of 4 sec (Instruction). Immediately following each Maintain and Suppress block, a blank screen with a rating scale appeared for 4 sec asking participants to rate candidly the intensity of their negative affect on a 5-point scale (1 ⫽ least negative/neutral, 5 ⫽ extremely negative) via button response by pressing the button  www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych  212 BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2005;57:210 –219  K.L. Phan et al  Figure 1. Exemplar segment of the behavioral paradigm for emotion regulation. Salient emotional pictures are presented in 20-sec blocks, preceded by instructions to “Maintain” or “Suppress” the evoked affect. Following each block, the subject provided a rating of the intensity of their negative emotional state.  1–5 times (Rating). This was followed by a 20-sec baseline block of blank fixation images (4 sec each) to minimize carryover effects (Baseline, B). During this period, subjects were asked to stop maintaining or suppressing their emotional experience and to “relax and clear your mind.” The order of Maintain and Suppress epochs was presented in a pseudo-randomized order over two separate sessions, which were counterbalanced across subjects.  Image Acquisition  Functional MRI was performed on a 1.5-T Sonata scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) to acquire BOLD (blood oxygenation level– dependent) contrast using single-shot multi-echo T2*-weighted EPI (echoplanar imaging) with six evenly spaced echo times ranging from 18 to 93 msec (repetition time ⫽ 2000 msec; 192 mm field of vision, 32 ⫻ 32 matrix, 16 slices, 6-mm slice thickness, .6-mm slice gap; flip angle ⫽ 90°; Posse et al 1999). Slices were oriented axially or near axially along the AC-PC line. The first four volumes from each run were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Additionally, a T1-weighted high-resolution structural scan was acquired in each subject for subsequent anatomic localization. Head movement was minimized using a custom-fitted head holder, consisting of two-component polyurethane foam tightly molded around the head and neck.  Image Analysis  Data sets from all 14 subjects met our criteria for high quality and scan stability with minimum motion correction (⬍ 2 mm displacement in any one direction) and were subsequently included in fMRI analyses. Image processing and data analysis was performed using the statistical parametric mapping software package SPM99 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London; www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Standard pre-processing was applied comprising slice time correction, realignment, and spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) high-resolution T1 template. Images were resampled into this space with 2-mm isotropic voxels and smoothed with a  www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych  Gaussian kernel of 6-mm full-width at half-maximum to minimize noise and residual differences in gyral anatomy, resulting in an effective spatial resolution of 10.2 ⫻ 10.7 ⫻ 11.5 mm. Each normalized image was band-pass filtered (low-pass filter ⫽ canonical hemodynamic response function [HRF]; high-pass filter ⫽ 100 sec) to remove high- and low-frequency noise, respectively. The general linear model was applied from which statistical inferences were based on the theory of random Gaussian fields, and changes relative to the experimental conditions were modeled by convolution of boxcar epochs with the canonical HRF to approximate the activation patterns (Friston et al 1995). Using multiple regression analysis, we constructed statistical parametric maps (SPMs) representing the association between the observed time series (e.g., BOLD signal) and one or a linear combination of the regressors for each subject. The SPMs were derived for brain activity related to the following:  1. main effects of task for Suppress (S ⬎ B) and Maintain (M ⬎  B);  2. conjunction of effects across both Maintain and Suppress tasks versus baseline (e.g., [M ⬎ B] AND [S ⬎ B]) to identify regions that activate in both tasks in response to aversive picture blocks (Price and Friston 1997);  3. effect of Suppress versus Maintain (S ⬎ M) to identify regions with greater activity during voluntary suppression of negative emotion;  4. effect of Maintain versus Suppress (M ⬎ S) to identify regions with less activity during voluntary suppression of negative emotion;  5. negative correlation with intensity of negative emotion to identify regions in which activity was inversely related to negative affect; and  6. positive correlation with intensity of negative emotion to identify regions in which activity was associated with negative affect.  Of note, contrasts 1– 4 modeled brain activity only for the 20-sec blocks during which the pictures were presented and during the active task of Maintain or Suppress and did not  K.L. Phan et al  BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2005;57:210 –219 213  include the Instruction or Rating portions of the imaging run, thereby removing any influence on brain activity related to reading the instruction and generating the rating response, respectively. These analyses used two separate, complementary statistical approaches—a standard block-design analysis of taskdependent activation of two conditions of interest (M and S) identical for all subjects (contrasts 1– 4) and an individualized analysis of using the subjective ratings (e.g., subjects’ own online rating of their affect following each Maintain and Suppress block) as a covariate of brain activation (contrasts 5– 6; Phan et al 2003, 2004). This latter analysis serves as a complement to the standard condition-specific analysis (e.g., S ⬎ M) that uses an on– off “boxcar” regressor to model the expected hemodynamic response, specific to each condition. As previously described (Phan et al 2003, 2004), this analysis involved convolving the predicted height of the canonical HRF with a stepwise function using the subjective ratings as individualized regressors rather than the conventional boxcar regressor, identical for each subject. The affective ratings from each subject following each block were covaried with the BOLD response averaged across the entire block for each voxel across the entire brain. Thus the rating-specific regressors, taken from the 5-point emotional scale, varied in discrete steps and was intended to reflect within- and between-subject differences in affective experience following both Maintain and Suppress conditions across the entire imaging run, as well as serve as an index for the outcome (e.g., success or failure) of the emotion regulation strategies (Phan et al 2003). Subject-specific parameter estimates pertaining to each regressor were calculated at each voxel, and contrast images (SPMs) were calculated by applying appropriate linear contrasts to the parameter estimates. These contrasts images were then entered into a one-sample t test across the 14 subjects in a second-level, random-effects analysis to allow for inferences to the general population. This produced statistical parametric maps of the t statistic at each voxel, which were subsequently transformed to the Z distribution. From voxelwise comparisons, activation foci within a priori regions were considered significant with a height threshold of p ⬍ .005 uncorrected (t ⬎ 3.01), with an extent of at least 5 contiguous voxels. Predicted regions included the amygdala, extended amygdala/ventral striatum (including the NAcc), insula, ACC, MPFC, and LPFC, derived from prior independent observations of regional activation associated with cognitive influences on emotional processing (Beauregard et al 2001; Hariri et al 2000; Keightley et al 2003; Lange et al 2003; Levesque et al 2003; Ochsner et al 2002; Pessoa et al 2002; Schaefer et al 2002; Taylor et al 2003). These thresholds are commonly applied in the emotion imaging literature and were intended to strike a balance between type I and II error rates. Outside of a priori regions, we report activation foci above a p ⬍ .05, corrected for multiple comparisons across the entire brain.  Results  Behavioral Results  All subjects were debriefed following their scanning session and reported compliance with both “Maintain” and “Suppress” instructions. Each subject reviewed the pictures postscan, and none of the subjects reported having to close their eyes or resort to thinking irrelevant thoughts. Furthermore, they all reported that they were able to use the reappraisal strategies practiced before scanning; examples were provided by each subject to confirm their use of cognitive manipulation of the content of negative pictures. Most of the subjects did say, however, that  Figure 2. Subjective ratings of intensity of negative affect following each Maintain and Suppress block across the experiment.

As expected, the intensity of negative emotion was higher following the Maintain block than the Suppress block (Mean rating ⫾ SD: 4.27 ⫾ .33 vs. 1.95 ⫾ .70, respectively; t (13) ⫽ 11.30, p ⬍ .001). A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not reveal a significant effect of time or time by condition interaction (p ⬎ .5).

These activations were related to the experience of viewing the aversive pictures and were not related to a particular task.  In identifying which brain regions were differentially activated between tasks, a direct contrast (contrast 4) between Suppress and Maintain blocks showed greater activity in the DMPFC (BA 8), dorsal ACC (BA 32), DLPFC (BA 9), lateral OFC (BA 11), and VLPFC (BA 46)/inferior frontal gyrus (including Broca’s area [BA 44]) during Suppress relative to Maintain condition (Table 1, Figure 3). In contrast, greater activity was  observed in the left NAcc, left LPFC (BA 46), and left sublenticular/periamygdala area during Maintain relative to Suppress (Table 1, Figure 3).  To examine the interaction between prefrontal and limbic regions, we focused on the relationship in brain activation between the left amygdala, observed to be activated during both Suppress and Maintain, and the prefrontal regions that were differentially activated during Suppress (vs. Maintain). To do this, we extracted the raw BOLD signal time series/courses from the peak activation foci/voxel within each of these regions (DMPFC, dorsal ACC, DLPFC, VLPFC, OFC; see Table 1) and from the left amygdala ([–18, – 4, –20]); these regions served as our functional regions of interest (ROIs). From the raw BOLD signal values, we calculated percent BOLD signal change during Suppress and Maintain blocks (vs. Baseline) averaged across each condition for each subject. We then performed a correlation analysis of these values between the ROIs. Of the prefrontal ROIs, only the right VLPFC (BA 47: [34, 54, 12]) showed a significant negative correlation with left amygdala (Pearson r ⫽ –.466, p ⫽ .01); there were no significant positive correlations detected.  Activation Related to Emotional Experience (Contrast 5– 6). The response in dorsal ACC (BA 24/32), bilateral DLPFC (BA 8), right anterior insula, and bilateral VLPFC (BA 46/10) was inversely related to the intensity of negative emotion (Table 2). Thus, increasing activity in these specific frontal regions was associated with decreasing negative affect (Figure 3). In contrast, activity in occipital cortex (BA 17–19), left DLPFC (BA 9), right VLPFC (BA 46) cortex, and left amygdala were positively correlated with intensity of negative emotion (Figure 4). Thus, increasing activity in these regions was associated with increasing intensity of negative affect.  Discussion  This fMRI study of emotion regulation is one of the first to examine the neural substrates involved in the voluntary suppression of negative affect and the relationship between these substrates and subjective, individual emotional experience. Several findings emerged that both extend and are consistent with recent observations from similar studies on the functional neuroanatomy of emotion regulation (Beauregard et al 2001; Levesque et al 2003; Ochsner et al 2002).

Across both tasks, negatively valenced pictures evoked general activation of the primary visual cortex (BA 17), bilateral insula, bilateral amygdala, and MPFC. Activation of DMPFC (BA 9), dorsal ACC (BA32), and bilateral OFC (BA11), DLPFC (BA 9, and VLPFC [BA 46/47]/ inferior frontal gyrus (including Broca’s Area [BA 44]) was specifically observed during Suppress condition (relative to Maintain). In contrast, activity during left NAcc, left LPFC (BA 46), and left sublenticular/periamygdala area was selectively greater during Maintain relative to Suppress. Activity within left VLPFC (BA 47) was negatively correlated with that within left amygdala. Furthermore, our findings show that activation of the dorsal ACC (BA 24/32), bilateral DLPFC (BA 8), right anterior insula, and bilateral VLPFC (BA 46/10) was inversely related to the intensity of negative emotion, whereas activity in occipital cortex (BA 17–19), left DLPFC (BA 9), right VLPFC (BA 46) cortex, and left amygdala was positively correlated with intensity of negative emotion.  In response to evaluating and experiencing negatively valenced pictures, subjects recruited several limbic and paralimbic brain regions including the amygdala, anterior insula, MPFC, and primary visual cortex, as confirmed by our main effects and conjunction analyses. The amygdala, insula, and MPFC have been consistently implicated as key components of the neural circuit involved in the detection of emotional significance and in the generation of negative affective states (Davidson and Irwin 1999; George et al 1995; Pardo et al 1993; Phan et al 2002; Reiman et al 1997) in response to emotional faces (Morris et al 1996; Phillips et al 1997; Whalen et al 1998), pictures (Irwin et al 1996; Lane et al 1997b; Reiman et al 1997; Taylor et al 2000), and recall of personal life events (Damasio et al 2000; Lane et al 1997a; Liotti et al 2000). The amygdala, insula, and MPFC have together been implicated as playing general roles during emotional processing (for reviews, see Davidson and Irwin 1999; Phan et al 2002; Phillips et al 2003a). These regions may be responding to the negative pictures present during both tasks and are involved in general in evaluation and responding to emotionally salient  stimuli, generation of emotional responses, and awareness of internal emotional states. Of note, conjunction analysis revealed left, but not right, activation of the amygdala during both Suppress and Maintain tasks, and we interpret that the presence of highly negatively valenced pictures, present across both tasks, may have driven the left-lateralization. We note, however, that the linguistic/verbal nature of the tasks, conscious perception and evaluation of the sensory stimuli, lack of habituation, the chosen significance threshold, or a combination of these may also have contributed to the left-lateralization of amygdala activation (Wager et al 2003; Zald 2003).  Voluntary suppression of negative affect by cognitive reappraisal recruited several frontal regions including DMPFC, dorsal ACC, DLPFC, VLPFC, and OFC. This finding is consistent with several converging lines of evidence from affective neuroscience that have provided support the role of dorsal frontal cortex (dorsal ACC and DMPFC) and OFC in emotion regulation. Our findings support and extend prior observations of the prior fMRI study by Ochsner and colleagues using a similar emotion regulation strategy (Ochsner et al 2002). In that study, affective modulation by reappraisal was also associated with increased activation of the lateral and medial prefrontal cortices. In another study by Levesque et al (2003), suppression of sadness via an alternative cognitive strategy (e.g., detachment) resulted in activations within the right OFC, the DLPFC, and, less consistently, the dorsal ACC. Interestingly, other indirect observations of emotion regulation have implicated dorsal ACC, DMPFC, VLPFC, and/or OFC in voluntary control of physiologic arousal (Critchley et al 2002), inhibition of sexual arousal (Beauregard et al 2001), and in cognitive modulation of emotional responses by appraisal or labeling of stimulus salience (Hariri et al 2000; Lange et al 2003; Taylor et al 2003). In support, experiments in rodents have suggested that ablation of MPFC and OFC interferes with extinc Figure 4.

Phan et al  tion of conditioned fear responses (Morgan and LeDoux 1995) and that the MPFC is critically involved in the inhibition of conditioned fear (Garcia et al 1999; Milad et al 2004; Quirk et al 2003), and human lesions in these regions produce syndromes characterized by impulsivity, poor behavioral control, and instability in affective responses (Damasio 1994; Davidson et al 2000). Collectively, these findings provide growing support for the dorsal ACC, DMPFC, VLPFC, and OFC in the regulation of affective states.  A major limitation to our study design and interpretation of findings involves the absence of stimuli with other types of valence, such as positive or pleasant pictures or neutral pictures, therefore, the activations during reappraisal may not be specific to changes in negative affect. In other words, frontal regions engaged during Suppress may have been related to more general reappraisal, independent of valence or evoked affect. Recent published imaging studies on emotion regulation that that have included a neutral condition (none to date have employed a paradigm involving reappraisal of positively-valenced stimuli) have presented similar findings (Levesque et al 2003; Ochsner et al 2002). Nevertheless, activation in these prefrontal regions can be mutually attributed to more general cognitive processes (versus down-regulation of negative emotion specifically). These same regions are commonly activated across cognitive tasks that involve inhibiting prepotent response tendencies (e.g., Go/NoGo, Stroop interference) (Braver et al 2001; Garavan et al 2002) and are implicated in neurobiological models of executive or cognitive control of behavior (Carter et al 2000; Miller and Cohen 2001). If emotional responses to salient stimuli can be conceptualized as reflexive (LeDoux 1996), attempts to manipulate them may engage executive processes that involve processes that exert voluntary control over behavior. Therefore, as previously proposed by Ochsner and colleagues (2002), an overlapping set of prefrontal regions that are involved in cognitive control may also be generally engaged during reappraisal, cognitive processing (e.g., attention, executive function, working memory, etc.), or, specifically, involved in the cognitive suppression of emotion. In our study, subjects were instructed to attend to and actively generate, modify/update, and keep in mind effective strategies for reappraising a diverse set of visually complex, unpleasant stimuli, as well as to mediate the competition between top-down (e.g., voluntary suppression) and bottom-up (e.g., evoked emotions) processes. Therefore, we would expect that such complex executive processes employing different types of cognitive processes would use the same brain regions involved in working memory such as the DLPFC and VLPFC and in selective attention and resolving response conflicts or interference such as the dorsal ACC (Cabeza and Nyberg 2000; Carter et al 2000; Miller and Cohen 2001). We would argue that such processes are inherently involved during emotion regulation. In future studies, more sophisticated designs with individual trials or events and task-switching paradigms may be able to clarify this important issue.  We did note that the lateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46) was also activated in the Maintain ⬎ Suppress contrast, suggesting that the DLPFC may have a role in different levels of emotion regulation (e.g., maintenance and suppression). The observed LPFC Maintain-related activation was left-sided, whereas most of the lateral prefrontal activations associated specifically with Suppress were right-lateralized. Such lateralization have hint toward different roles for a similar region. Previous studies have shown that providing verbal labels to emotional states, stimuli, or events activates left lateral prefrontal cortex (Crosson et al 1999; Hariri  www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych  et al 2003; Lange et al 2003), consistent with the processes involved in maintaining negative affect. In contrast, studies on voluntary behavioral inhibition (consistent with emotion suppression) have reported right-sided activations of the lateral prefrontal cortex (Bunge et al 2001; Garavan et al 1999; Konishi et al 1999). The possibility that the DLPFC may have differential roles during regulation of emotion is intriguing, however, and awaits further study.  this cognitive circuit could reflect  Our findings also show that increasing activity within the dorsal ACC, DLPFC, and VLPFC was not only associated with voluntary suppression of affect but was also correlated with decreasing intensity of negative affect. We suggest that increased recruitment of increasing effectiveness in emotion regulation. Particularly, the dorsal ACC has been proposed to play a critical role in monitoring and adjusting the ongoing need for additional cognitive control (Botvinick et al 2001; Kerns et al 2004). This interpretation is also consistent with findings from the study by Ochsner and colleagues, who also reported a positive correlation between dorsal ACC activity and a drop in negative affect (e.g., effective reappraisal). Increased levels of negative affect may also reflect reduced recruitment of top-down control mechanisms. Interestingly, Bishop and colleagues (2004) recently showed that states of high anxiety were associated with lower levels of ACC activity during the perception of threat-related stimuli. We also observed an inverse relationship between negative affect and insular activity (which was activated during both Maintain and Suppress); this is inconsistent with a number of previous studies on negative affect or emotion and arousal (Critchley et al 2001; Phan et al 2002; Phillips et al 1997). Although some evidence exists that the insula may also respond to positively valenced emotion insular activity is (Kuniecki et al 2003), inversely related to increasing intensity of negative affect is counter to our a priori hypothesis and requires further investigation.  the suggestion that  Our findings also show that voluntary suppression of affect via cognitive reappraisal can attenuate activity in brain regions responsible for evaluation and experience of negative affect or emotional salience, such as the nucleus accumbens and sublenticular/periamygdala (Liberzon et al 2003; Zink et al 2003). Given that amygdala proper was engaged during both tasks, we did not detect a difference in activity within the amygdala during Maintain (e.g., M ⬎ S). However, our regression analysis using individualized ratings was sensitive in detecting a relationship between increasing activity in the left amygdala and increasing intensity of negative affect (Phan et al 2003). These findings are consistent with proposed models for the NAcc, extended amygdala/SLEA, and amygdala’s role in monitoring and responding to emotional salience (Liberzon et al 2003; Phan et al 2003; Whalen et al 1998), including signals of threat (Morris et al 1996; Whalen et al 1998), extending the role of the NAcc beyond reward (Knutson et al 2001; Zink et al 2004). Furthermore, the direct relationship between amygdala activation and increasing negative affect may serve as indicator for subjectively perceived failure in voluntary modulation of emotional responses elicited by the highly aversive pictures. We have previously demonstrated that activity in the amygdala and extended amygdala (including the ventral striatum/NAcc) corresponds to individual ratings of emotional intensity (Phan et al 2003) and serves as a sensor for increasing emotional salience or threat. Similar to our study, Schaefer and colleagues (2002) have observed that active maintenance of negative emotion evoked by aversive pictures led to increased activation of the amygdala. Our findings are also  K.L. Phan et al  BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2005;57:210 –219 217  consistent with prior functional imaging studies on emotion regulation showing attenuation of amygdala activity by cognitive reappraisal of aversive pictures (Ochsner et al 2002), detachment from sad films (Levesque et al 2003), and attempted inhibition of sexual arousal (Beauregard et al 2001). Additionally, increased cognitive effort can also diminish activation of limbic regions. For example, emotional tasks that require additional cognitive demand also can modulate responses in the amygdala and extended amygdala (Hariri et al 2000; Phan et al 2002; Taylor et al 2003). Directing attention away from emotionally evocative stimuli can also attenuate amygdala activation (Keightley et al 2003; Pessoa et al 2002). We hypothesize that in our study, cognitive reappraisal (e.g., reframing into positive outlook, or rationalizing) may have indirectly averted attention from the negative aspects of the aversive pictures, and thereby resulted in decreased activation of amygdala and extended amygdala/NAcc. We note that dorsal ACC and amygdala had opposite relationships with intensity of negative affect, prompting the question of a potential reciprocal relationship between frontal regions exerting top-down cognitive control and subcortical limbic regions responding to emotional value, arousal, salience, or a combination of these. Our correlation analysis of BOLD signal change during Suppress and Maintain conditions between frontal cortical and limbic regions did reveal an inverse relationship between VLPFC (BA 47) and the left amygdala. We note, however, that our long block-related design (e.g., requiring averaging of BOLD signal data over the entire 20-sec block) and inclusion of only negative pictures limited our ability to test this functional interaction more explicitly. Furthermore, our main effects analysis showed activation of the amygdala during both Maintain and Suppress conditions, suggesting that the activity in the amygdala was task-independent and not modulated by reappraisal in this experiment. Activation of the amygdala during both tasks may be related to the fact that a negative affect was maintained during the imaging run because of the presence of only aversive pictures (e.g., no neutral or positive pictures were presented). Some evidence suggests, however, that the PFC may be responsible for modulating responses in limbic amygdala. Animal studies show that direct stimulation of prefrontal inputs inhibits neuronal firing in and affective responses mediated by the amygdala (Rosenkranz and Grace 2001; Rosenkranz et al 2003). Furthermore, medial and ventral prefrontal regions appear to have a direct influence on amygdala-mediated fear conditioning (Garcia et al 1999; Milad et al 2004; Morgan and LeDoux 1999; Quirk et al 2003). Human functional brain imaging studies have also reported reciprocal relations between the PFC (including medial and orbital regions) and amygdala (Abercrombie et al 1998; Hariri et al 2003; Liberzon et al 2002). More specifically, recent studies have demonstrated the role of VLPFC (BA 47) in exerting cognitive or inhibitory influences on emotional and limbic (e.g., amygdala) responses (Hariri et al 2003; Keightley et al 2003; Lange et al 2003; Levesque et al 2003) and cognitive control in general (Konishi et al 1999). Additional studies will be needed to clarify both the process and interaction between PFC and amygdala during emotion regulation.  Before concluding, several limitations of the study are worth discussion. First, the study design limits conclusive inferences about the prefrontal, including dorsal ACC, activation and successful inhibition of negative affect. Given the preliminary nature of these findings, we would advise caution in interpreting the subjective ratings as a direct measure of efficacy or reappraisal success. Because ratings were not collected after each picture (e.g., trial) within the Suppress block, it could be argued that the  decrease in negative ratings following Suppress is a result of perceiving the pictures as less aversive rather than the result of reappraisal. We did not collect any physiologic data (e.g., skin conductance, startle response, etc.) during scanning and relied solely on subjective reports with ratings, which may be also be susceptible to bias. Nonetheless, the behavioral data on subjective ratings showed little change (e.g., no decrement) following the both Maintain and Suppress blocks over the course of the experiment (see Figure 2), suggesting that negative valence was maintained over time. Moreover, the participants subjectively reported that their chosen reappraisal strategies were generally effective in reducing negative affect and that their postblock ratings were candid measures of their emotional state. Furthermore, these findings are also consistent with prior work on emotion regulation and negative emotion (Levesque et al 2003; Ochsner et al 2002), which also depended on subjective measures. Similarly, we also relied on their postscan reports that they had used the reappraisal strategies established during extensive training when they were performing the task in the scanner. Second, although we used a conservative random-effects analysis of our fMRI data to protect against false positives, our small sample size may have introduced other errors; therefore, more conclusive evidence for a true absence of activation in certain brain areas awaits a larger cohort. Third, although our sample included an equal number of male and female subjects, having both genders may have added additional variability in our results given that gender differences can influence the brain’s response to negative stimuli and/or during emotion processing. For example, recent studies have shown that women have greater activation of the amygdala and ACC (Wrase et al 2003), prefrontal cortices (Kemp et al 2004) in response to negative stimuli; that men have greater amygdala activation to sexually arousing stimuli (Hamann et al 2004); and that gender can mediate lateralization of amygdala activation in relation to emotional faces (Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd 2001) and emotionally laden memory storage (Cahill et al 2001; Canli et al 2002). Finally, our study design lacked two components critical to a more complete understanding of the neural substrates of emotion regulation: 1) inclusion of positive valence or approach-related emotional stimuli (discussed earlier) and 2) voluntary enhancement of negative or positive emotion. Additional studies will be needed to further elucidate these important questions.  Conclusions  In conclusion, we present functional imaging evidence that the voluntary regulation of negative emotion by appraisal engages the dorsal anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and lateral prefrontal cortices, a neural circuit responsible for higher order executive functions such as cognitive control of behavior. We also showed that ongoing changes in intensity of negative affect during emotion regulation (e.g., relative success or failure) are mediated by activity within the dorsal ACC and amygdala, respectively. These findings shed light on the putative neural mechanisms for effective cognitive therapy for anxiety and mood disorders (Brody et al 1998, 2001; Mayberg 2003; Paquette et al 2003) and for general mental well-being (Gross 1999). Indeed, there now exists evidence for hypofunction of the dorsal ACC and MPFC or hyperactivity of the amygdala in the neural pathophysiology related to dysregulation of emotion such as anxiety (Bremner 2003; Davidson 2002; Shin et al 2004) and mood disorders (Drevets 2001; Lawrence et al 2004; Phillips et al 2003b; Sheline et al 2001). It is hoped that these and other recent findings will shed light on the cognitive, affective, and neural  www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych  218 BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2005;57:210 –219  K.L.

Working   memory   is   linked   to  substance   use disorders   and   can   serve   as   a  representation   of   the   demand   placed   on  the   neurophysiology   associated with   cognitive   control. Methods:  Behavior   and   brain   activity   (via   fMRI)   were   recorded   during   an   N-Back   working   memory   task in  controls   (CTRL),   nondependent   heavy   drinkers   (A-ND)   and  dependent   heavy   drinkers   (A-D).   Typical and   novel   step-wise   analyses   examined   proﬁles   of   working   memory   load   and  increasing   task   demand, respectively. Results:   Performance   was   signiﬁcantly   decreased   in   A-D  during   high   working   memory   load   (2-Back),   compared  to  CTRL   and   A-ND.   Analysis   of   brain   activity   during   high   load   (0-Back   vs.   2-  Back)   showed   greater responses   in  the  dorsal   lateral   and  medial   prefrontal   cortices   of   A-D   than   CTRL,   suggesting   increased but   failed   compensation.   The   step-wise   analysis   revealed   that  the   transition   to   Low   Demand   (0-Back   to 1-Back)  was   associated   with   robust   increases   and  decreases   in  cognitive   control   and  default-mode   brain regions,   respectively,   in   A-D   and   A-ND   but   not   CTRL.   The   transition   to  High   Demand   (1-Back   to   2-Back) resulted   in   additional   engagement   of  these   networks   in  A-ND  and  CTRL,   but   not   A-D. Conclusion:   Heavy   drinkers   engaged   working   memory   neural   networks   at   lower   demand   than   controls. As   demand   increased,   nondependent   heavy   drinkers   maintained   control   performance   but   relied   on  additional  neurophysiological   resources,   and   dependent   heavy   drinkers   did   not   display   further   resource engagement   and   had   poorer   performance.   These   results   support   targeting   these   brain   areas   for   treatment interventions.  ©   2017   Elsevier   B.V.   All   rights   reserved.  1.  Introduction  Not  all  heavy  drinkers  develop  alcohol  use  disorder,  despite having  similar  alcohol  use  patterns.  Identifying  neurobehavioral patterns  that  differentiate  heavy  drinkers  who  develop  alcohol  use disorder  from  those  who  do  not  will  provide  valuable  information  about  the  individual  differences  associated  with  this  disorder, thereby  informing  treatment  efforts.  A  common  approach  used to  characterize  neurobehavioral  abnormalities  associated  with mental  health  problems  like  alcohol  use  disorder  is  to  compare  individuals  with  a  particular  condition  to  controls  using  experimental tasks  designed  to  measure  speciﬁc  neural  processes  and  associ ∗ Corresponding  author  at:  Medical  Behavioral  Science  Building,  Lexington,  Kentucky,  USA.

In  this way,  challenging  brain  activity  and  behavior  during  task  performance  can  uncover  deﬁciencies  and/or  compensatory  mechanisms. In  particular,  the  cognitive  control  of  behavior  and  inter-connected processes  such  as  working  memory  have  been  a  research  focus due  to  their  essential  roles  in  normal  psychosocial  functioning. For  example,  studies  using  working  memory  tasks  and  neuroimaging  techniques  have  demonstrated  working  memory  deﬁcits  are linked  to  altered  brain  activity  in  various  mental  health  disorders including,  but  not  limited  to,  schizophrenia  (Jansma  et  al.,  2004), pathological  dissociation  (Elzinga  et  al.,  2007)  and  bipolar  disorder (Cremaschi  et  al.,  2013).  Abnormal  working  memory  has  also  been  identiﬁed  as  a  critical  concern  in  substance  use  disorders,  having  been  demonstrated in  individuals  dependent  on  alcohol  (Pitel  et  al.,  2007)  and  various other  classes  of  drugs  including  opioids  (Vo  et  al.,  2014),  cannabinoids  (Vo  et  al.,  2014),  stimulants  (Albein-Urios  et  al.,  2012;  Duarte  M.J.  Wesley  et  al.  /  Drug  and  Alcohol  Dependence  175  (2017)  24–35   25  et  al.,  2012).  That  working  memory  deﬁcits  are  found  across  problematic  users  of  alcohol  and  other  drugs  is  perhaps  not  surprising considering  that  impaired  control  over  the  use  of  these  substances is  a  characteristic  of  substance  use  disorders  and  behavioral  control  relies,  in  part,  on  working  memory  (Hofmann  et  al.,  2008). More  speciﬁcally,  control  over  the  decision  to  use  alcohol  and  other drugs  requires  working  memory  to  integrate  information  related to  previous  consequences  of  substance  use  and  current  contingencies  surrounding  the  decision  to  use  (Weber  and  Johnson,  2009). Reduced  working  memory  capacity  in  these  individuals  might  be more  easily  overloaded  during  the  evaluation  of  this  information, resulting  in  impulsive,  maladaptive  substance  use  decisions  in  the present  and  for  the  future  (Wesley  and  Bickel,  2014;  Wesley  et  al., 2014).  Indeed,  several  theories  of  impulsivity  as  a  factor  in  drug abuse  and  in  externalizing  disorders,  such  as  ADHD,  posit  a  bidirectional  relationship  between  working  memory  and  inhibitory control  (Barkley,  1997;  Fillmore,  2003;  Finn,  2002).  Consistent  with this  idea,  studies  have  shown  that  low  working  memory  ability is  associated  with  greater  trait  impulsivity  (e.g.,  Gunn  and  Finn, 2013).  Experimental  manipulation  of  working  memory  load  has revealed  that  increasing  load  to  a  capacity  limit  increases  impulsive  performance  on  a  decision-making  task  (Hinson  et  al.,  2003). Also,  research  on  the  acute  effects  of  alcohol  on  inhibitory  control  showed  that  the  disinhibiting  effects  of  the  drug  are,  in  part, due  to  the  alcohol-induced  reductions  in  information  processing capacity  (Fillmore  and  Van  Selst,  2002).  Taken  together,  these  lines of  evidence  provide  corroborating  evidence  for  the  important  link between  working  memory  and  under-controlled  behavior.  A  substantial  amount  of  clinical  research  has  characterized  the neurocircuitry  underlying  cognitive  control  and  working  memory,  as  well  as  the  network-level  changes  that  occur  as  these processes  are  engaged.  A  recent  meta-analysis  (Niendam  et  al., 2012)  of  193  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI)  studies indicated  that  the  primary  brain  regions  involved  in  the  cognitive  control  of  behavior  included  prefrontal  cortex  regions,  such as  the  dorsal  lateral  prefrontal  cortex  (DLPFC)  and  the  anterior cingulate  cortex  (ACC),  as  well  as  the  superior  and  inferior  parietal  cortices  (sPar),  precuneus  and  precentral  gyrus.  In  general, these  areas  are  part  of  an  integrated  dorsal  processing  stream involved  in  overlapping  cognitive  functions  (Wesley  and  Bickel, 2014)  that  is  engaged  in  response  to  external  demand.  For  example, engagement  of  the  DLPFC,  superior  parietal  cortices,  ACC,  striatum, thalamus  and  insula  has  been  detected  by  fMRI  during  working memory  tasks,  in  line  with  the  performance  requirements  of  those tasks,  such  as  match  mismatch  detection  and  response  inhibition  (reviewed  in  Wilcox  et  al.,  2014).  By  contrast,  when  external demand  is  not  present  and  the  brain  is  considered  to  be  in  the default  mode  of  functioning,  activity  is  greater  in  brain  areas  such as  the  ventral  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (vmPFC)  and  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC)  (Raichle  and  Snyder,  2007;  Wang  and  Li,  2013). As  external  demand  is  imposed,  activity  typically  decreases  in  the default-mode  network  and  increases  in  cognitive  control  networks, consistent  with  the  heuristics  of  a  free  energy  framework  for  biological  systems  (Friston,  2009,  2010;  Friston  et  al.,  2006).  Altered  brain  activity  has  been  demonstrated  using  fMRI  during  the  performance  of  working  memory  tasks  in  individuals  with substance  use  disorders.  By  way  of  introduction  to  the  present study,  the  following  overview  focuses  on  research  in  adults  with alcohol  use  disorder  that  used  N-Back  type  tasks,  which  are  wellestablished  working  memory  tasks  that  have  been  adapted  for use  in  a  neuroimaging  environment.  While  performing  a  2-Back spatial  working  memory  task,  individuals  with  alcohol  use  disorder  displayed  reduced  bilateral  DLPFC  activation  compared  to control  participants  when  performing  the  task  at  equivalent  level (Pfefferbaum  et  al.,  2001).  In  another  study  (Tapert  et  al.,  2001), emerging  adult  (i.e.,  18–25  years  old)  women  with  alcohol  use  dis order  and  matched  controls  completed  a  task  in  which  they  were instructed  to  respond  when  an  abstract  line  drawing  appeared  in  a location  that  had  been  previously  occupied.  Participants  with  alcohol  use  disorder  were  less  accurate  on  the  task  and  had  less  activity in  the  right  superior  and  inferior  parietal,  right  middle  frontal,  right postcentral  and  left  superior  frontal  cortex  compared  to  controls. In  a  study  that  used  a  non-spatial  2-Back  task,  reduced  activity  was observed  in  the  bilateral  frontal  and  pre-central  cortex  and  left superior  temporal  and  parietal  cortices  of  individuals  with  alcohol  use  disorder  compared  to  social  drinkers  (Park  et  al.,  2011). Importantly,  these  impairments  in  working  memory  performance and  altered  activity  in  associated  brain  areas  appear  to  be  clinically signiﬁcant.  For  example,  individuals  with  alcohol  use  disorder  who exhibited  greater  bilateral  rostral  and  ventral  lateral,  prefrontal  cortex  activity  given  equivalent  performance  of  a  2-Back  task  were more  likely  to  remain  abstinent  through  a  7  month  post-treatment period  (Charlet  et  al.,  2014).  A  limitation  of  prior  studies  that  have  evaluated  working  memory  performance  and  associated  brain  activity  in  individuals  with alcohol  use  disorder  is  that  a  control  group  with  similar  alcohol  use  history  has  not  been  included  to  differentiate  between alcohol  exposure  and  problematic  behaviors.  Furthermore,  those studies  have  not  considered  dynamic  changes  in  brain  activity and/or  recruitment  of  other  regions  as  a  step-wise  function  of neurophysiological  demand.  Understanding  how  brain  function changes  in  response  to  increasing  task  demand,  however,  could provide  new  insights  into  the  neural  resources  (or  lack  thereof) available  to  meet  the  external  constraints  placed  on  the  cognitive control  processes  needed  for  successful  abstinence  and/or  recovery. The  present  study  sought  to  extend  previous  work  by  comparing working  memory  performance  and  associated  brain  activity  in  individuals  who   met   criteria  for  alcohol  use  disorder  (heavy  drinkers who  were  dependent;  A-D)  to  a  group  with  a  comparable  alcohol use  history  (heavy  drinkers  who  were  nondependent;  A-ND),  as well  as  a  group  of  individuals  who  reported  non-problematic  alcohol  use  (CTRL).  Further,  this  study  included  zero-  (0-Back),  low(1-Back)  and  high-  (2-Back)  working  memory  load  conditions.  In addition  to  typical  analyses  examining  brain  activity  during  low (0-Back  vs.  1-Back)  and  high  (0-Back  vs.  2-  Back)  working  memory  load  conditions,  the  current  study  used  a  step-wise  transitional approach  to  determine  the  concurrent  increases  and  decreases  in brain  activity  associated  with  transitioning  to  neurophysiological  states  with  low  (1-Back  >  0-Back  and  1-Back  <0-Back)  and  high (2-Back  >1-Back  and  2-Back  <  1-Back)  external  demand  on  neurophysiological  resources.  In  this  way,  we   sought  to  identify  potential differences  in  the  neurophysiological  capacity  associated  with  a critical  cognitive  process  in  individuals  who  vary  in  their  alcohol  use  history  and  expression  of  problem  drinking  behaviors.  To the  extent  that  neurobehavioral  impairments  are  associated  with alcohol  dependence  and  not  just  heavy  alcohol  consumption,  we predicted  reduced  performance  and  brain  activity  in  heavy  drinkers who  were  dependent  relative  to  the  nondependent  heavy  drinkers.  2.  Methods  2.1.  Participants  The  Wake  Forest  School  of  Medicine  Institutional  Review  Board approved  the  study  protocol.  Potential  participants  responded  to local  media  advertisements  by  phone  and  an  initial  screen  was  performed  to  determine  study  eligibility.  Individuals  reporting  illicit drug  use,  diseases  of  the  central  nervous  system,  head  trauma, current  use  of  psychotropic  medications,  or  any  condition  that  prohibited  entry  into  an  MRI   scanner  were  ineligible.  Individuals  who passed  this  initial  screening  were  invited  to  the  laboratory  for  addi 26   M.J.

Once  arriving  at  the  laboratory,  expired  air  samples  were  tested for  alcohol  (Intoxilyzer  SD-5;  CMI   Inc.,  Owensboro,  KY)  and  urine samples  were  tested  for  illicit  drugs  (Multipanel  Urine  Screen; Innovacon,  Inc,  San  Diego,  CA)  and  pregnancy  (QuickVue  urine  HCG test;  Quidel  Inc,  San  Diego,  CA).  Individuals  who  tested  positive for  alcohol,  other  drugs  (i.e.,  marijuana,  cocaine,  amphetamines, opiates  and  benzodiazepines)  or  pregnancy  were  excluded  from participation.  To  evaluate  alcohol  use  history,  psychiatric  conditions,  and  intelligence,  potential  participants  completed  the Alcohol  Use  Disorders  Identiﬁcation  Test  (AUDIT)  (Babor  et  al., 2001),  the  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-IV  Disorders (SCID)  (First  et  al.,  2002)  and  the  Wechsler  Abbreviated  Scale  for Intelligence  (WASI)  (Wechsler,  1999),  respectively.  Consistent  with previous  methods  (Wesley  et  al.,  2011,  2016),  individuals  with  current  Axis  I  disorders  (excluding  alcohol  use  disorder)  or  an  IQ  of  less than  80  were  excluded  from  further  participation.  Three  experimental  groups  were  established  based  on  AUDIT and  SCID  evaluations.  Individuals  who  scored  4  or  less  on  the  AUDIT, indicating  a  history  of  minimal  alcohol  consumption  and  no  alcohol  related  problems,  were  considered  a  control  group  for  heavy drinkers  (CTRL;  n  =  11).  Individuals  who  scored  8  or  more  indicating a  history  of  considerable  alcohol  consumption  and  alcohol  related problems  were  operationally  deﬁned  as  heavy  drinkers  (n  =  23). Heavy  drinkers  were  further  divided  into  individuals  who   did  and did  not  meet  criteria  for  alcohol  dependence  based  on  previously established  SCID  criteria  (Conigrave  et  al.,  1995)  and  received  additional  questions  about  their  alcohol  use  patterns.  Individuals  who did  not  meet  criteria  for  current  alcohol  dependence  (i.e.,  two  or  less criteria)  were  placed  in  the  heavy-  drinking  alcohol  nondependent group  (A-ND;  n  =  11),  whereas  those  who  met   criteria  for  current  alcohol  dependence  (i.e.,  three  or  more  criteria)  were  placed  in  the heavy-drinking  alcohol  dependent  group  (A-D;  n  =  12).  Worth  noting  is  that  the  criteria  used  to  deﬁne  alcohol  dependence  under  the DSM-IV  overlap  to  a  large  extent  with  those  used  to  deﬁne  alcohol  use  disorder  (AUD)  under  the  current  DSM-V,  and  likewise,  the characterization  of  alcohol  dependence  and  severity  of  AUD  relates to  the  number  of  criteria  met.  Therefore,  heavy-drinking  subjects in  the  present  study  would  likely  have  been  separated  into  two distinct  groups  under  the  DSM-V  as  well  (e.g.,  no/mild  AUD   vs. moderate/severe  AUD).  Once  assigned  to  an  experimental  group, individuals  were  scheduled  for  a  second  laboratory  visit.  They  were informed  that  during  the  second  visit  they  would  perform  a  working  memory  task  while  inside  an  MRI   machine  and  were  once  again asked  to  abstain  from  alcohol  for  at  least  twelve  hours  prior  to  their scheduled  visit.  2.2.  Procedure  On  the  day  of  scanning,  participants  arrived  at  the  laboratory approximately  2  h  prior  to  entering  the  MRI   scanner.  Expired  air and  urine  samples  were  collected  again  and  test  for  alcohol,  illicit drugs  and  pregnancy.  No  participants  were  excluded  from  participation  based  on  these  screening  tests.  To  assess  anxiety  levels at  the  time  of  scanning,  participants  completed  the  Spielberger State-Trait  Anxiety  Scale  (STAI)  (Spielberger  et  al.,  1983).  Participants  were  also  asked  about  and  monitored  for  signs  of  alcohol withdrawal.  Withdrawal  signs  and  symptoms  were  assessed  by self-report  at  intake  and  monitored  during  the  session  by  a  trained laboratory  technician.  Participants  were  asked  if  they  had  experienced  unusual  tremors,  anxiety,  nausea,  headaches,  sweating, irritability,  confusion,  insomnia,  nightmares  or  high  blood  pressure in  the  past  twenty-four  hours.  No  participants  reported  abnormal  M.J.  Wesley  et  al.  /  Drug  and  Alcohol  Dependence  175  (2017)  24–35   27  levels  of  any  of  these  symptoms,  and  did  not  differ  from  controls  on a  measure  of  state  anxiety  at  the  time  of  testing  (see  Table  1).  Next, participants  completed  components  of  the  CANTAB  neuropsychological  battery  (Cambridge  Cognition,  Cambridge,  UK),  including Delayed  Match  to  Sample  (DMS;  visual  working  memory  assessment),  Intradimensional/Extradimensional  Shift  (ID/ED;  cognitive ﬂexibility  assessment)  and  Stockings  of  Cambridge  (SOC;  a  spatial planning  assessment).  Approximately  30  min   prior  to  entering  the  scanner,  participants  were  familiarized  with  the  N-Back  task  on  a  laptop  computer and  the  response  apparatus  to  be  used  in  the  scanner.  Task  instructions  were  read  aloud  by  a  study  technician  and  each  participant practiced  the  N-Back  task.  Once  participants  were  familiar  with the  task,  they  were  given  a  15  min   break  before  entering  the  scanner.  During  this  time,  tobacco  cigarette  smokers  were  allowed  to smoke  one  cigarette  to  minimize  potential  nicotine  withdrawal effects  during  data  collection  (Wang  et  al.,  2007;  Xu  et  al.,  2007). No  members  of  the  CTRL  group,  one  member  of  the  A-ND  and  one member  of  the  A-D  group  took  advantage  of  the  opportunity  to smoke  a  cigarette  before  the  neuroimaging  scanning  session.  Given the  small  number  of  individuals  per  group  who   chose  to  smoke  a cigarette,  these  data  were  not  included  as  a  covariate  in  analyses. The  average  number  of  self-reported  cigarettes  smoked  by  group members,  less  than  a  standard  pack  of  20  cigarettes  in  each  group (see  Table  1),  was  included  as  nuisance  variables  in  all  analyses.  2.3.  N-Back  task  The  N-back  task  used  in  the  current  study  was   a  visual-based letter  variant  with  three  conditions  (0-Back,  1-Back  and  2-Back) (Callicott  et  al.,  1999).  During  each  condition,  participants  viewed a  sequence  of  randomized  white  letters  presented  one  at  a  time on  a  black  background  (i.e.,  B,  G,  P,  T,  V  and  X).  Each  time  a  letter appeared,  participants  pressed  one  of  two  buttons  on  a  response box  positioned  under  their  right  hand.  For  the  0-Back  condition, participants  were  instructed  to  press  button  1  (i.e.,  match  response) with  their  index  ﬁnger  each  time  the  letter  “X”  appeared  on  the screen  and  to  press  button  2  (i.e.,  mismatch  response)  with  their middle  ﬁnger  each  time  a  different  letter  appeared.  As  such,  the 0-Back  condition  required  attention  and  a  behavioral  response,  but did  not  engage  working  memory.  During  the  1-Back  condition,  participants  made  a  match  response  if  the  letter  currently  displayed on  the  screen  was  identical  to  letter  shown  1  presentation  previously  (e.g.,  viewing  sequence:  B,  G,  T,  T,  G,  T,  G,  G;  correct  responses: ,  2,  2,  1,  2,  2,  2,  1).  For  the  2-Back  condition,  participants  made  a match  response  if  the  letter  currently  displayed  on  the  screen  was identical  to  the  letter  shown  2  presentations  previously  (e.g.,  viewing  sequence:  B,  G,  T,  T,  G,  T,  G,  G;  correct  responses:  ,  2,  2,  2,  1, 1,  2).  The  1-Back  and  2-Back  conditions  therefore  represent  lowand  high-  working  memory  load,  respectively.  Fig.  1A  illustrates the  relationship  between  N-Back  conditions  and  the  theoretical demand  placed  on  neurophysiological  resources  during  task  performance.  ,   The  N-Back  task  was  presented  to  the  participants  via  MRI   compatible  goggles  (Resonance  Technology  Inc.,  Los  Angeles,  CA).  Each participant  completed  two  “runs”  of  the  N-Back  task  in  the  MRI scanner  and  each  run  contained  two  “blocks”  of  each  of  the  three N-Back  task  conditions  (0-Back,  1-Back  and  2-Back).  N-Back  task blocks  were  randomized  within  each  run  and  each  block  started with  a  5  s  instruction  screen  indicating  the  condition  about  to  be performed  followed  by  a  5  s  countdown.  At  the  end  of  the  countdown,  a  sequence  of  12  letters  was  presented  one  at  a  time  for 500  ms   and  button  presses  were  recorded  for  each  letter  presentation.  The  inter-stimulus  interval  between  each  letter  presentation was  2000  ms,   such  that  each  block  lasted  a  total  of  40  s.  Each  block  Fig.  1.  The  N-Back  task,  neurophysiological  demand  and  different  analytical approaches.  (A)  The  three  N-Back  task  conditions  (0-,  1-  and  2-Back)  and  their relationship  to  working  memory  (WM)   load  and  the  demand  placed  on  neurophysiological  resources.  Demand  is  presented  on  the  y-axis  and  task  conditions  are presented  on  the  x-axis.  During  the  0-Back  condition,  neurophysiological  demand is   minimal  as  attention  and  match/mismatch  responses  are  required  but  there  is  no WM   load.  During  the  1-Back  condition  demand  is  increased  to  a  low  level  as  a  low WM   load  is  added  to  the  task.  During  the  2-Back  condition,  demand  is  increased further  to  a  high  level  as  a  high  WM  load  is  added  to  the  task.  (B)  A  typical  analytical   approach  isolates  brain  activity  associated  with  high  WM  load  by  subtracting activity  observed  in  the  0-Back  condition  from  that  observed  in  the  2-Back  condition.  This  approach  therefore  includes  neurophysiological  signals  also  required for   the  low  WM  load  condition.  A  transitional  analytical  approach  examines  stepwise  increases  in  demand  by  isolating  neurophysiological  signals  associated  with the   transition  between  increasing  N-Back  conditions  (0-Back  to  1-Back  =  transition to   Low  Demand;  1-Back  to  2-Back  =  transition  to  High  Demand:  bolded  and  unique to   the  current  study).  was  separated  by  a  12  s  interval,  so  that  the  total  task  time  lasted approximately  20  min.  2.4.   fMRI  data  acquisition  ×   1.0   ×   3.75   ×   1.0  mm,   176   Images  were  acquired  on  a  1.5T  General  Electric  scanner with  a  birdcage-type  standard  quadrature  head  coil  and  an advanced  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  echoplanar  system.  The head  was  positioned  along  the  canthomeatal  line.  Foam  padding was  used  to  limit  head  motion.  Higher-resolution  T1-weighted anatomical  images  (3D  SPGR,  relaxation  time  (TR)  =  14  ms,  excitation  time  (TE)  =  7700  ms,   ﬂip  angle  =  25◦,  voxel  dimensions × 1.0    256  voxels,  160  slices)  were  acquired for  co-registration  and  normalization  of  functional  images.  A total  of  200  co-planar  functional  images  were  acquired  during  each  run  of  the  N-Back  task  using  a  gradient  echoplanar sequence  (TR  =  2100  ms,   TE  =  40  ms,   ﬂip  angle  =  90◦,  voxel  dimen× sions  3.75    5.0  mm).   Two  radio  frequency  excitations  were performed  prior  to  image  acquisition  to  achieve  steady-state  transverse  relaxation.  The  scanning  planes  were  oriented  parallel  to the  anterior  commissure–posterior  commissure  line  and  extended from  the  superior  extent  of  motor  cortex  to  the  base  of  the cerebellum.  Nine  volumes  of  data  were  acquired  during  the  20  s countdown  period  before  each  run  and  immediately  discarded  to allow  for  equilibrium  before  task  onset.  28   M.J.  Wesley  et  al.  /  Drug  and  Alcohol  Dependence  175  (2017)  24–35  2.5.  Statistical  analyses:  demographics  and  behavior  One-way  analyses  of  variance  (ANOVAs)  were  used  to  compare  the  three  experimental  groups  on  AUDIT  scores,  age,  IQ  and cigarette  use.  Chi-square  tests  were  used  to  compare  groups  on  sex and  race/ethnicity-related  nonparametric  variables.  Independent samples  t-tests  were  used  to  compare  A-ND  and  A-D  groups  on alcohol  drinking-related  variables.  One-way  ANCOVAs  with  nicotine  use  (cigarettes  per  day)  as  a  covariate  were  used  to  compare groups  on  CANTAB  tasks  (DMS  percent  correct,  ID/ED  total  errors and  SOC  number  of  problems  solved  in  minimum  moves)  and  NBack  reaction  times.  −   false  alarms  possible)   Two  approaches  were  used  to  analyze  behavioral  accuracy  on the  N-Back  task.  For  the  ﬁrst  approach,  which  was   consistent with  typical  N-Back  accuracy  analyses,  a  percentage  based  accuracy  score  was  calculated  for  every  participant  for  each  N-Back − condition.  Accuracy  was  calculated  as:  Accuracy  =  [(hits    hits  pos× × sible)/(false  alarms    100].  A  3    3  mixed model  ANCOVA,  with  cigarettes  per  day  as  a  covariate,  was  performed  with  N-Back  condition  as  the  within  group  factor  (i.e., 0-Back,  1-Back  and  2-Back)  and  experimental  group  as  the  between group  factor  (i.e.,  CTRL,  A-ND  and  A-D).  When  Mauchly’s  Test  of Sphericity  was  signiﬁcant  (e.g.,  within  group  variability  differed across  N-Back  conditions),  degrees  of  freedom  were  adjusted  using the  Greenhouse-Geisser  correction.  To  test  for  group  differences within  each  N-Back  condition,  one-way  ANCOVAs  for  independent samples  (i.e.,  CTRL,  A-ND  and  A-D)  were  conducted  for  each  N-Back condition.  Bonferonni  tests  were  utilized  for  all  post-hoc  comparisons.  The  second  approach  examined  how  behavioral  accuracy changed  in  response  to  step-  wise  increases  in  neurophysiological  demand.  Accuracy  change  scores  were  calculated  for  0-  Back  to 1-Back  and  1-Back  to  2-Back.  The  difference  in  accuracy  between 1-Back  and  0-Back  was  deﬁned  as  a  Low  Demand  transition  and the  difference  in  accuracy  between  2-Back  and  1-  Back  was   deﬁned × as  a  High  Demand  transition.  A  2    3  mixed  model  ANCOVA,  with cigarettes  per  day  as  a  nuisance  variable,  was  performed  with demand  level  as  the  within  group  factor  (i.e.,  Low  Demand  and High  Demand)  and  experimental  group  as  the  between  group factor  (i.e.,  CTRL,  A-ND  and  A-D).  When  Mauchly’s  Test  of  Sphericity  was  signiﬁcant,  degrees  of  freedom  were  adjusted  using  the Greenhouse-Geisser  correction.  To  test  for  group  differences  at each  demand  level,  one-way  ANCOVAs  for  independent  samples (i.e.,  CTRL,  A-ND  and  A-D)  were  conducted  at  each  demand  level. Bonferonni  tests  were  used  for  post-hoc  multiple  comparisons analyses.  Behavioral  analyses  were  conducted  using  the  Statistical Package  for  the  Social  Sciences  (SPSS;  version  22.0)  with  minimum statistical  signiﬁcance  thresholds  set  at  p  <  0.05.  2.6.  Statistical  analysis:  fMRI  preprocessing  and  data  analysis  As  described  previously  (Wesley  et  al.,  2011),  each  participant’s neuroimaging  data  were  preprocessed  using  standard  techniques. Functional  volumes  were  corrected  for  slice  acquisition  time (i.e.,  slice  timing  correction)  and  realigned  to  the  ﬁrst  volume acquired  (i.e.,  motion  correction).  Each  participant’s  structural volume  then  functional  volumes  were  warped  into  standardized neuroanatomical  space  (Montreal  Neurological  Institute).  Next, functional  volumes  were  smoothed  using  a  Gaussian  8  mm  kernel and  high-pass  ﬁltered  (128s)  to  remove  low  frequency  noise.  For  each  participant,  a  ﬁrst-level  ﬁxed  effects  analysis  was   performed  to  isolate  brain  activity  associated  with  each  N-Back  block type  (i.e.,  0-Back,  1-Back  and  2-Back).  Each  block  type  was   entered as  an  explanatory  variable  in  a  general  linear  model.  Head  movement  parameters  obtained  from  motion  correction  were  entered as  explanatory  nuisance  variables.  Blood  oxygen-level  dependent  Fig.  2.

(A)  Performance  accuracy ± (mean    SEM;  y-axis)  across  increasing  N-Back  conditions  (0-Back,  1-Back  and  2Back;  x-axis)  in  controls  (CTRL),  heavy  drinkers  who  were  alcohol  nondependent (A-ND)  and  heavy  drinkers  who   were  alcohol  dependent  (A-D).  Increased  working memory  load  was  associated  with  reduced  accuracy  in  each  group.  At  the  highest working  memory  load  (2-Back),  accuracy  in  A-D  was  signiﬁcantly  less  than  CTRL and  A-ND  (†   A-ND  >  A-D;  p  <  0.05).  (B)  A  typical  analysis  of  activity  at high  working  memory  load  (0-Back  vs.  2-Back)  revealed  greater  activity  in  cognitive control  and  attention  brain  areas,  including  bilateral  dorsal  lateral  prefrontal  cortex (DLPFC)  and  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (mPFC),  in  A-D  relative  to  CTRL.    CTRL  >  A-D;   ‡  (BOLD)  signals  associated  with  explanatory  variables  were  convolved  with  a  hemodynamic  response  function  and  statistical contrast  maps  were  generated  that  reﬂected  activity  during  each  NBack  condition.  These  contrast  maps  were  then  carried  forward  into second-level  within  and  between  group  random  effects  analyses. Two  analytical  approaches  were  used  to  examine  within  and between  group  brain  activity  during  the  N-Back  task.  Fig.  1B  illustrates  (1)  typical  and  (2)  step-wise  analytical  approaches  and  their relationship  to  N-Back  conditions  and  the  demand  placed  on  neurophysiological  resources.  The  typical  approach  focused  on  brain activity  at  low  and  high  working  memory  load  by  comparing  each load  condition  to  the  control  condition  (i.e.,  1-Back  vs.  0-Back; 2-Back  vs.  0-  Back).  The  step-wise  approach  focused  on  brain  activity  associated  with  increasing  neurophysiological  demand.  Low Demand  activity  was  calculated  by  also  contrasting  maps  of  0-  Back versus  1-Back  (i.e.,  increased  activity  =  1-Back  >  0-Back;  decreased activity  =  1-Back  <  0-  Back)  whereas  High  Demand  was  unique  in that  activity  was  calculated  by  contrasting  activity  maps  of  1-Back versus  2-Back  (i.e.,  increased  activity  =  2-Back  >  1-Back;  decreased activity  =  2-Back  <  1-Back).  Note  that  the  analysis  of  brain  activity during  the  low  working  memory  load  condition  is  identical  to  the step-wise  Low  Demand  transition  (i.e.,  0-Back  vs.  1-Back),  so  the results  from  this  analysis  are  only  presented  once.  Within  group  analyses  utilized  one-sample  t-tests  with  voxelwise  probability  thresholds  set  to  p  <  0.001  and  spatial  cluster extents  set  to  25  contiguous  voxels.  Between  group  analyses  utilized  independent  samples  t-tests  with  voxel-wise  probability  M.J.  Wesley  et  al.  /  Drug  and  Alcohol  Dependence  175  (2017)  24–35   29  Fig.  3.  Within  group  changes  in  accuracy  and  brain  function  associated  with  transitioning  from  the  0-Back  to  the  1-Back  conditions  of  the  N-Back  task  (Low  Demand)  in controls  (CTRL;  left),  heavy  drinkers  who  were  alcohol  nondependent  (A-ND;  middle)  and  heavy  drinkers  who  were  alcohol  dependent  (A-D;  right).

Voxel-  level  probability  thresholds  were  set  to  p  <  0.001  and  corrected  at  the  cluster  level  (FWE,  p  <  0.05).  R  =  right  hemisphere. sPar   =  superior  parietal  cortex.

DLPFC  =  dorsal  lateral  prefrontal  cortex.  mPFC  =  medial  prefrontal cortex.  thresholds  set  to  p  <  0.01  and  spatial  cluster  extents  set  to  25  contiguous  voxels.  Multiple  comparison  correction  was  performed using  small  volume  family-wise  error  correction  (FEW,  p  <  0.05). Number  of  cigarettes  per  day  was  included  as  a  variable  of  no  interest  in  all  second-level  models.  Data  preprocessing  and  analyses were  performed  with  custom  MATLAB  7.0  (Mathworks,  Natick,  MA) scripts  and  standard  statistical  parametric  mapping  (SPM5;  Wellcome  Department  of  Cognitive  Neurology,  London,  UK;  (Ashburner and  Friston,  2005)).  3.  Results  Grouping,  demographic,  alcohol-  and  other  cognition-related  variables  are  shown  in  Table  1.  3.2.  Demographics  and  other  variables  Groups  did  not  differ  in  age,  IQ,  sex  or  race/ethnicity.  Groups also  did  not  differ  in  state  or  trait  anxiety  at  the  time  of  data  collection.  A-D  smoked  signiﬁcantly  more  cigarettes  per  day  than CTRL;  therefore,  the  number  of  cigarettes  smoked  per  day  was added  as  a  nuisance  variable  in  behavioral  and  neuroimaging  analyses.  CANTAB  task  performance  and  N-Back  reaction  times  are  also reported  in  Table  1.  CANTAB  performance  did  not  differ  between groups  on  the  ID/ED  task  (a  measure  of  cognitive  ﬂexibility)  or the  SOC  task  (a  measure  of  spatial  planning).  Groups  did  differ, however,  on  the  DMS   task  (a  measure  of  visual  working  memory; F2,32  =  4.5,  p  <  0.02),  with  a  signiﬁcantly  lower  percentage  of  correct  responses  in  A-D  compared  to  A-ND.  Groups  did  not  differ  in N-Back  reaction  times.  3.1.  Group  assignment  3.3.

Decreased  activity was  observed  in  the  ventral  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (vmPFC)  in A-D  and  A-ND,  and  all  groups  showed  decreased  activity  in  the posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC)  during  2-Back,  compared  0-Back. Between  groups  comparisons  revealed  that  AD  had  signiﬁcantly greater  activity  in  bilateral  DLPFC  and  vmPFC,  compared  to  CTRL, during  2-Back  relative  to  0-Back  (Fig.  2B).  A  typical  analysis  of  brain  activity  during  the  low  working  memory  load  condition  (0-  Back  vs.  1-Back)  is  identical  to  the  step-wise Low  Demand  transition,  so  the  results  from  this  analysis  are  only presented  once,  in  a  subsequent  section.  Typical  analysis  of  within group  brain  activity  during  the  high  working  memory  load  condition  of  the  N-Back  task  (0-Back  vs.  2-Back)  revealed  similar  general patterns  of  increased  (2-Back  >  0-Back)  and  decreased  (2-Back  <  0Back)  activity  in  all  groups  (Fig.  S1).

As  demand  increased  from  low  to  high  (1-  Back  to  2-Back),  A-D  had  signiﬁcantly  less  activity  in  the  ventral medial   prefrontal  cortex  (vmPFC),  compared  to  CTRL.

Within  group  analyses  of  the  transition  to  Low  Demand, however,  revealed  some  general  similarities  and  differences  in activity  patterns  within  the  groups  (Fig.  3B;  Table  2A).  CTRL  displayed  decreased  activity  in  the  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC; cluster  size:  kE  =  248)  and  increased  activity  in  the  superior  parietal  cortex  (sPar).  By  comparison,  similar  activity  patterns  were observed  in  heavy  drinkers  but  were  larger  in  number,  magnitude and  spatial  extent.  For  example,  decreased  activity  in  the  PCC  of A-ND  and  A-D  occurred  in  clusters  sized  kE  =  5155  and  kE  =  4588, respectively.  Decreased  activity  was  also  observed  in  the  medial prefrontal  cortex  (mPFC)  within  A-ND  and  A-D,  but  not  CTRL.  Lastly, increased  activity  was  observed  in  bilateral  DLPFC  within  A-ND  and A-D,  but  not  CTRL.  Suprathreshold  clusters  did  not  survive  between group  testing  criteria  (Table  2B).  3.6.  Accuracy  and  brain  activity  associated  with  transition  to high  demand  Behavior  and  brain  activity  associated  with  the  transition  from Low  Demand  to  High  Demand  (1-Back  to  2-Back)  is  shown  in Fig.  4.  Groups  signiﬁcantly  differed  in  accuracy  change  scores  associated  with  the  transition  from  Low  Demand  to  High  Demand (Fig.  4A;  F2,35  =  4.59,  p  <  0.02).  Post  hoc  analysis  revealed  that the  percentage  accuracy  difference  between  1-Back  and  2-Back in  A-D  (−0.28±0.05),  relative  to was  signiﬁcantly  decreased  CTRL  (−0.10±0.03).  The  percentage  accuracy  difference  in  A-ND (−0.16±0.06)  fell  between  that  of  CTRL  and  A-D  and  did  not  significantly  differ  from  either  group.  Within  group  brain  activity  associated  with  the  transition  from Low  Demand  to  High  Demand  is  displayed  in  Fig.  4B  and  Table  3A. Increased  activity  was  observed  in  CTRL  in  the  dorsal  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC),  precuneus  (prCun),  bilateral  sPar  and  the right  DLPFC.  Decreased  activity  was  observed  in  the  ventral  medial prefrontal  cortex  (vmPFC)  of  CTRL.  Note  that  the  mPFC  effects observed  in  CTRL  are  more  ventral  than  those  observed  in  A-D during  the  transition  to  Low  Demand  (0-Back  vs.  1-Back).  A-ND did  not  show  additional  decreased  activity  during  the  transition  to High  Demand,  but  displayed  large  clusters  of  increased  activity  in the  dmPFC,  prCun,  bilateral  sPar  and  bilateral  DLPFC.  A-D  displayed minimal  increased  activity  in  bilateral  sPar,  dmPFC  and  right  DLPFC. Analysis  of  between-group  differences  in  brain  activity  associated  with  the  transition  from  Low  Demand  to  High  Demand revealed  signiﬁcant  differences  between  CTRL  and  A-D  as  well  as A-ND  and  A-D,  but  not  CTRL  and  A-ND  (Fig.  5;  Table  3B).  Speciﬁcally,  the  increased  activity  in  the  left  sPar  of  A-ND  was  signiﬁcantly greater  than  sPAR  activity  observed  in  A-D.  Additionally,  there was  a  signiﬁcantly  larger  decrease  in  mPFC  activity  observed  in CTRL  compared  to  A-D,  indicating  that  the  greater  mPFC  activity  observed  in  A-D  compared  to  CTRL  from  the  typical  0-Back versus  2-Back  analysis  was  at  least  partially  driven  by  the  significant  hypoactive  responses  in  ventral  portions  of  mPFC  in  CTRL associated  with  the  transition  from  1-Back  to  2-Back.  4.  Discussion  Reduced  working  memory  performance,  as  assessed  by  the  NBack  task,  has  been  demonstrated  in  individuals  diagnosed  with  a range  of  mental  health  conditions,  including  alcohol  dependence (Pitel  et  al.,  2007,  2009).  Consistent  with  those  prior  results,  the present  study  revealed  that  individuals  in  the  alcohol-dependent (A-D)  group  were  less  accurate  on  the  2-Back  condition  of  the  task than  participants  in  the  nondependent  heavy  drinker  (A-ND)  and control  (CTRL)  groups.  The  majority  of  the  neurophysiological  changes  (i.e.,  energy expenditure  as  reﬂected  by  oxygen  utilization  and  detected  with  fMRI)  observed  in  the  current  study  are  consistent  with  previous  ﬁndings  from  studies  that  used  neuroimaging  techniques to  determine  the  neural  correlates  of  working  memory.  Typical within-group  analyses  comparing  brain  activity  during  the  zero and  high  load  conditions  of  the  task  (0-Back  vs.  2-Back;  see  Supplementary  data)  revealed  that  all  three  groups  independently  utilized brain  regions  previously  demonstrated  to  be  involved  in  attention and  working  memory  processes,  including  the  bilateral  dorsal  lateral  prefrontal  cortex  (DLPFC),  superior  parietal  cortex  (sPar)  and dorsal  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC).  All  groups  also  independently  displayed  decreased  activity  in  default-mode  network  brain areas,  including  portions  of  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (mPFC) and  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC).  That  imposing  task  demands results  in  decreased  activity  in  default-mode  related  brain  areas  and increased  activity  in  attention  and  cognitive  control  brain  areas  is a  ﬁnding  consistent  across  neuroimaging  studies  using  a  variety of  tasks  to  measure  cognitive  performance.  Group  comparisons  of brain  activity  during  the  high  working  memory  load  condition  (0Back  vs.  2-Back)  revealed  that  A-D  subjects  had  greater  activity  in both  the  mPFC  and  bilateral  DLPFC  compared  to  CTRL.  Thus,  A-D subjects  displayed  greater  activity  in  portions  of  both  default  and  attention/cognitive  control  networks  during  high  working  memory  demand,  suggesting  that  their impaired  task  performance  might  be  related  to  an  inability  to  suppress  mPFC  activity  despite  compensatory  increases  in  the  DLPFC to  meet  greater  task  demand.  However,  a  limitation  of  that  analytic approach  and  subsequent  interpretation  is  that  the  comparison  of 0-Back  to  2-Back  also  includes  physiological  changes  attributable  to the  low  demand  condition  of  the  task  (1-Back).  Therefore,  to  better  understand  the  relationship  between  the  increasing  demand placed  neurophysiological  resources  and  its  relationship  to  problematic  drinking,  we   initiated  a  step-wise  analysis  examining changes  in  behavior  and  brain  activity  associated  with  transitioning  to  a  Low  Demand  state  (e.g.,  0-Back  to  1-Back)  and  further  to  a High  Demand  state  (e.g.,  1-Back  to  2-Back).  The  transition  to  Low  Demand  did  not  differentially  impact  task performance  across  groups,  whereas  the  transition  to  High  Demand resulted  in  impaired  accuracy  in  A-D  relative  to  CTRL.  In  general,  the results  from  the  within-group  analyses  were  suggestive  of  greater overall  functional  engagement  at  earlier  demand  in  heavy  drinkers relative  to  controls  (compare  within-  group  images  in  Figs.  2  B–3 B).  However,  between-group  comparisons  only  revealed  signiﬁcant differences  in  regional  brain  activity  associated  with  the  transition  to  the  High  Demand,  which  parallels  the  behavioral  results. The  results  from  those  analyses  indicated  that  A-  ND  had  signiﬁcantly  greater  activity  in  the  sPar  compared  to  A-D,  and  that  mPFC activity  was   decreased  to  a  greater  degree  in  CTRL  relative  to  A-D, during  the  transition  to  High  Demand.  The  sPar  is  part  of  a  dorsal processing  stream  that  is  related  to  attention  and  associated  with performance  on  experimental  tasks  measuring  various  cognitive domains,  including  attention  and  memory  (Kumfor  et  al.,  2015; Rosen  et  al.,  2015).  For  example,  the  sPar  was   found  to  mediate visuospatial  attention  in  a  recent  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  study  (Wu   et  al.,  2016).  The  mPFC,  on  the  other  hand,  is  part  of the  default-mode  network  and  decreased  activity  in  that  network is  consistent  with  a  shift  to  a  more  attention-focused  brain  state (Raichle  and  Snyder,  2007;  Wang  and  Li,  2013).  As  noted  above,  a common  interpretation  is  that  activity  in  default-  mode  networks must  decrease  (Koshino  et  al.,  2014)  and/or  desynchronize  (Gao et  al.,  2013)  as  neurophysiological  resources  are  reallocated  to  meet experimental  task  demands.  Inability  to  deactivate  or  disengage the  mPFC  has  been  associated  with  lapses  in  attention  (Weissman et  al.,  2006)  and  increased  errors  on  executive  functioning  tasks (Li  et  al.,  2007),  and  damage  to  the  mPFC  was  shown  to  impair performance  on  the  N-Back  task  (Tsuchida  and  Fellows,  2009). Together,  these  data  suggest  that  limited  engagement  of  the  sPar  BA   9   9   6  7  19  40   10   8   46   7  47  40  47   7  10  6  46   Precuneus   Middle  Frontal  Gyrus (DLPFC) Medial  Frontal  Gyrus (dmPFC) sFrontal  Gyrus  i/sParietal  Lobule  Middle  Occipital  Gyrus  i/sParietal  Lobule   Medial  Frontal  Gyrus (vmPFC)  sFrontal  Gyrus  (dmPFC)   Middle  Frontal  Gyrus (DLPFC) i/sParietal  Lobule  Insula  i/sParietal  Lobule Inferior  Frontal  Gyrus (Insula) Precuneus  Middle  Frontal  Gyrus  Superior  Frontal  Gyrus  Medial  Frontal  Gyrus (dmPFC)  no  suprathreshold cluster  Thalamus   Middle  Frontal  Gyrus (DLPFC) i/sParietal  Lobule  i/sParietal  Lobule  Medial  Frontal  Gyrus (dmPFC)  9   40  40  9   no  suprathreshold cluster  no  suprathreshold cluster  L   R    L    R   R   L   L    L   R   L    L   R   R   L    L   R   R   R    L   R    L   R   L    L   3A.

Further,  these  between-group  mPFC  ﬁndings  during  the transition  to  High  Demand  are  in  agreement  with  the  more  typical analysis  results  reported  above  and  suggest  that  the  greater  mPFC responses  in  A-D  vs.  CTRL  during  high  working  memory  load  (0 Back  vs.  2-  Back)  were  driven  at  least  in  part  by  decreasing  mPFC activity  in  CTRL  associated  with  the  transition  from  low  (1-Back)  to high  (2-Back)  demand  (conﬁrmed  by  the  within-group  results).  One  limitation  of  the  present  study  is  that  more  detailed  information  about  participants’  drinking  patterns,  in  particular  the number  of  drinks  consumed  on  the  same  occasion,  was  not  col 34   M.J.  Wesley  et  al.  /  Drug  and  Alcohol  Dependence  175  (2017)  24–35  lected  at  the  time  the  study  was  conducted.  Participants  were assigned  to  the  control  versus  heavy  drinking  groups  according  to AUDIT  scores,  with  individuals  who  scored  4  or  less  on  the  AUDIT being  considered  controls  and  individuals  who  scored  8  or  greater considered  heavy  drinkers.  However,  the  current  categorization  of heavy  drinking  by  the  United  States  National  Institute  of  Alcohol Abuse  and  Alcoholism  and  the  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Services  Health  Administration  (SAMHSA)  relies  on  information  about drinks  consumed  in  a  single  occasion.  More  speciﬁcally,  heavy drinking  is  deﬁned  as  consuming  5  or  more  drinks  on  the  same occasion  on  each  of  5  or  more  days  in  the  past  30  days  (SAMHSA, 2014).  Notwithstanding,  the  World  Health  Organization  has  used the  AUDIT  as  an  assessment  tool  for  deﬁning  alcohol  consumption  and  therefore  the  current  results  may   more  readily  translate  to international  assessments  of  alcohol  consumption.  Future  studies will  include  updated  SAMHSA  criteria  when  establishing  experimental  groups  and  will  also  focus  on  how  the  observed  effects may   relate  to  long-term  alcohol  dependent  heavy  drinkers  (e.g., >20  years)  as  well  as  individuals  who  do  not  yet  report  heavy consumption,  but  who  are  at-risk  for  alcohol  abuse  due  to  positive  family  history  of  alcoholism  (FH+).  For  example,  evidence  if FH+  subjects  showed  the  same  decreased  activation  patterns  to the  High  Demand  transition  compared  with  FH-  subjects,  those results  would  suggest  that  the  differential  behavior  and  brain  proﬁle  observed  here  is  a  precursor  to  heavy  alcohol  consumption rather  than  a  consequence.  Lastly,  because  the  current  study  did not  record  brain  activity  during  a  resting  state,  group  differences in  default-mode  network  activity  during  the  transition  into  task engagement  (i.e.,  0-Back)  could  not  be  determined.  Future  studies should  include  the  acquisition  of  resting  state  data  in  the  same  scanning  session  in  order  to  model  a  larger  range  of  neurophysiological transitions.  5.  Conclusion  In  conclusion,  the  behavioral  and  brain  changes  observed  in the  current  study  suggest  that  working  memory  deﬁcits  in  alcohol  dependent  individuals  are  associated  with  abnormal  function of  default  and  cognitive  control  brain  networks  in  response  to increasing  task  demands.  These  results  further  suggest  that  alcohol dependent  individuals  have  less  capacity  for  meeting  the  demand of  increasing  working  memory  loads.  From  a  treatment  standpoint, these  results  highlight  two  brain  areas  that  could  be  targeted  to improve  clinical  outcomes;  namely,  the  mPFC  (decreased  response  differentiating  CTRL  and  A-D)  and  left  sPar (increased  response  observed  in  A-ND  but  not  A-D).  One  strategy  is to  enhance  function  in  these  areas  through  noninvasive  brain  stimulation  or  cognitive  training  combined  with  tasks  known  to  engage them.  For  example,  working  memory  training  has  been  used  to  shift temporal  discounting  rates  in  cocaine  users  (Bickel  et  al.,  2011) and  it  has  been  hypothesized  that  this  training  increases  functional capacity  in  cognitive  control  networks  (Wesley  and  Bickel,  2014). This  approach  might  also  be  beneﬁcial  in  alcohol  dependent  individuals,  who  have  been  shown  to  devalue  future  rewards  (Bobova et  al.,  2009;  Mitchell  et  al.,  2005;  Petry,  2001).  Functional  enhancement  of  these  target  brain  areas,  resulting  in  the  ability  to  meet larger  external  demand,  may   lead  to  more  effective  treatment  outcomes  in  alcohol  use  disorder.

Introduction  The  neuropeptide  oxytocin  (OXT)  has  been  shown  to  promote a  variety  of  social  behaviors  in  humans  after  intranasal application  (Striepens  et  al.,  2011;  Bethlehem  et  al., 2013).  In  terms  of  facilitating  effects  in  the  domain  of  partner attraction,  OXT  has  been  shown  in  men  to  increase  the perceived  attractiveness  of  unfamiliar  women  (Theodoridou et  al.,  2009)  and  to  strengthen  bonds  between  existing partners,  both  by  increasing  the  perceived  attractiveness of  the  female  partner  and  the  distance  men  keep  between themselves  and  attractive  unfamiliar  women  (Scheele  et  al., 2012).  In  the  bonding  domain  OXT  has  also  been  shown  to increase  trust  and  cooperation  (Baumgartner  et  al.,  2008; Kosfeld  et  al.,  2005)  and  empathy  (Domes  et  al.,  2007; Hurlemann  et  al.,  2010).  Pioneering  work  using  animal  models  ﬁrst  established  that intracerebroventricular  OXT  promoted  the  establishment  of both  maternal-offspring  bonds  in  sheep  (Kendrick  et  al., 1987)  and  partner  bonds  in  monogamous  voles  (Williams et  al.,  1994).  Furthermore,  evidence  from  these  animal models  showed  that  OXT  could  exert  these  modulatory effects  on  both  attraction  and  bonding  by  inﬂuencing  classical  neurotransmitter  release  (Kendrick,  2000).  In  the  domain of  partner-bonds,  a  key  initial  observation  was  that  the density  of  OXT  receptors  (OXTR)  was  signiﬁcantly  greater in  the  nucleus  accumbens,  an  important  dopaminergic  (DA, dopamine)  reward  center,  of  monogamous  prairie  voles  as opposed  to  other  species  of  voles  which  were  promiscuous (Insel  and  Shapiro,  1992).  Subsequently  it  was  shown  that  the OXT-elicited  partner  preference  in  monogamous  female prairie  voles  is  blocked  by  a  DA  D2 receptor  (D2R)  antagonist. Furthermore,  microinjection  of  a  D2R  agonist  into  the nucleus  accumbens  (NAcc)  can  promote  a  partner  preference in  the  absence  of  mating,  an  effect  blocked  by  either  a  D2R  or an  OXTR  antagonist.  Thus  co-activation  of  D2R  and  OXTR  in the  striatum  may  be  important  for  pair  bond  formation  and  its maintenance  (Liu  and  Wang,  2003).  Recently  D2R—OXTR heteromers  with  facilitating  receptor—receptor  interactions have  also  been  found  in  the  striatum  (Romero-Fernandez et  al.,  2012),  further  emphasizing  the  potential  functional importance  of  interactions  between  D2R  and  OXTR.  In  humans  it  has  also  been  proposed  that  OXT  may facilitate  both  attraction  and  bonding  via  interactions  with D2R  (Zeki,  2007;  Skuse  and  Gallagher,  2009),  with  it  being proposed  that  OXT  may  enhance  the  hedonic  value  of  social interactions  by  speciﬁcally  acting  on  D2R  in  dopaminergic reward  centers.  Facilitation  of  interpersonal  trust  by  OXT (Baumgartner  et  al.,  2008;  De  Dreu  et  al.,  2010;  Kosfeld et  al.,  2005)  has  been  attributed  to  the  inhibition  of  defensive  behaviors  and  the  activation  of  dopaminergic  reward circuits  (Skuse  and  Gallagher,  2009).  Similarly,  OXT  facilitation  of  face  attraction  (Theodoridou  et  al.,  2009)  has  been  linked  with  potential  modulation  of  striatal  dopaminergic  reward  mechanisms  since  the  striatum  shows enhanced  activation  with  increasing  facial  attractiveness (Aharon  et  al.,  2001;  Cloutier  et  al.,  2008;  Liang  et  al., 2010;  Winston  et  al.,  2007).  Furthermore,  potential  interactions  between  OXT  and  dopaminergic  signaling  in  brain reward  centers  has  received  support  from  a  study  showing effects  of  OXTR  polymorphisms  on  dopaminergic  function (Love  et  al.,  2012).  In  view  of  the  growing  evidence  suggesting  that  OXT  may inﬂuence  both  attraction  and  bonding  behavior  via  a  modulation  of  DA  release  our  main  objective  in  the  current  study was  to  investigate  whether  OXT  facilitation  of  perceived attractiveness  of  unfamiliar  women  by  men  was  associated both  with  activation  of  dopaminergic  brain  reward  centers and  increased  liberation  of  DA.  We  decided  to  focus  on  OXT effects  of  attraction  ﬁrst  because  it  is  easier  to  investigate  in controlled  laboratory  conditions  than  bonding.  In  order  to  quantify  changes  in  both  neural  and  D2R activity  we  employed  positron  emission  tomography  (PET) and  the  antagonist  radioligand  [11C]raclopride  to  assess changes  in  the  D2R  binding  potential  (BPND)  providing  a sensitive  measure  of  endogenous  DA  release.  While  it  is commonly  recognized  that  striatal  regions  are  mainly  the most  reliably  measured  (Koepp  et  al.,  1998;  Laruelle,  2000) using  this  ligand,  recent  [11C]raclopride  studies  also  assessed D2R  occupancy  in  some  extra-striatal  regions  (Garraux  et  al., 2007;  Stokes  et  al.,  2010).  By  measuring  the  early  phase  of [11C]raclopride  PETwe  could  also  investigate  changes  in  brain perfusion,  thereby  allowing  us  to  quantify  neural  activation changes.  In  the  current  study  our  main  objective  was  to  establish whether  OXTeffects  in  increasing  perceived  attractiveness  of the  faces  of  unfamiliar  women  were  associated  with increased  activity  in  dopamine  reward  regions  and  in  altered D2R  binding.  We  therefore  used  a  double-blind,  placebo (PLC)-controlled,  within-subjects  design,  with  subjects  being presented  with  pictures  of  unfamiliar,  neutral  expression female  faces  during  the  sensitive  phase  of  [11C]raclopride PET scan.  An  important  consideration  in  our  study  design  was that  since  the  sensitivity  of  [11C]raclopride  PET  to  DA  changes is  lower  at  resting  state  and  comparatively  better  at  a starting  point  of  low-level  activation,  and  that  potential saturation  effects  can  occur  with  stimuli  of  maximum  reward value,  we  should  aim  to  raise  baseline  DA  levels  by  starting  to present  face  pictures  slightly  before  the  sensitive  phase  of the  PET  scan  timed  to  coincide  with  the  maximum  effect  of intranasal  OXT.  We  also  used  neutral  expression  female  faces rated  as  being  of  medium  attractiveness  to  avoid  possible problems  with  saturation  effects.  This  design  precludes  measurement  of  potential  OXT  effects  on  basal  dopaminergic activity,  but  our  main  objective  was  to  establish  changes associated  with  altered  face  attraction.  76   2.  Methods  2.1.  Participants  Eighteen  healthy,  male  volunteers  (age  range  21—36  years, mean  26.9    3.4  years)  gave  written  informed  consent  to participate  in  this  study,  in  accordance  with  the  Declaration of  Helsinki.  We  only  used  male  subjects  in  the  current  study since  including  female  ones  would  have  required  additional controls  for  potential  effects  of  menstrual  cycle  and  contraceptive  use.  The  MRI  and  PET  protocol  had  been  approved  by the  institutional  ethics  review  board  (IRB)  of  the  Medical Faculty  of  the  Heinrich  Heine  University  of  Du¨sseldorf  as  well as  the  German  Federal  Ofﬁce  of  Radiation  Protection.  All  participants  completed  a  comprehensive  neuropsychological  test  battery  to  control  for  cognitive  performance (Table  1).  2.2.  Study  design  In  this  double-blind,  randomized,  PLC-controlled,  counterbalanced  cross-over  study  we  compared  attractiveness  ratings  and  [11C]raclopride  PET  measures  of  DA  release  in  the same  human  participants  after  OXT  and  PLC  administration. Each  participant  completed  two  sessions  of  testing  separated by  at  least  4  days  (mean  13  days;  SD  16.59;  Fig.  1).  In  the  ﬁrst session  volunteers  self-administered  either  24  IU  of  intranasal  OXT  (Syntocinon  Spray,  Sigma-Tau,  Pomezia,  Italy;  3  puffs per  nostril,  each  puff  containing  4  IU  OXT)  or  PLC.  In  the second  session  they  received  the  alternate  treatment  (i.e. OXT  or  PLC).  In  both  sessions,  volunteers  completed  a  faceattraction  rating  task.  In  order  to  obtain  two  equivalent versions  of  this  task  (i.e.  one  for  each  PET  session),  we  Table  1   Demographics  and  neuropsychological  performance.

Striepens  et  al.  conducted  an  independent  pilot  experiment,  in  which  364 pictures  of  female  faces  were  rated  by  twelve  healthy  men, none  of  whom  participated  in  the  main  experiment.  These pictures  were  taken  in  house  from  female  volunteers  (aged 20—40  years)  who  gave  consent  for  study  use  but  not  for publication.  Only  pictures  rated  as  medium  attractive  were entered  into  the  ﬁnal  stimulus  pool  of  302  faces,  which  was divided  into  two  sets  (A  and  B)  of  151  faces.  These  two  sets did  not  differ  in  terms  of  attractiveness  and  trustworthiness (attractiveness:  M  =  5.36    1.22  and  M  =  5.39    1.22, p  =  0.828,  t(300)  =   0.22;  trustworthiness:  M  =  5.13    1.03 and  5.11    1.04,  p  =  0.897,  t(300)  =  0.13).  Thus,  in  the  main experiment,  both  drug  administration  and  task  performance (Set  A  or  B)  were  counterbalanced  across  subjects.  In  the  ﬁrst session  Group  1  was  treated  with  OXT,  followed  by  the behavioral  set  A  (n  =  5);  group  2  received  OXT,  followed  by set  B  (n  =  4),  group  3  received  PLC,  followed  by  set  A  (n  =  4); and  group  4  received  PLC,  followed  by  set  B  (n  =  5)  (Fig.  1).  In line  with  previous  studies,  behavioral  testing  commenced 48    16  min  after  OXT  or  PLC  was  administered  (Born  et  al., 2002;  Striepens  et  al.,  2011).  The  PET  scan  started 64    18  min  and 18    5  min  after  starting  the  attractiveness  rating  test  in order  to  allow  the  observation  of  female  faces  to  promote  a degree  of  pre-activation  of  the  dopaminergic  system.  Experiments  were  conducted  at  the  same  time  of  day  (morning)  for both  OXT  and  PLC  sessions  (actual  times  of  the  intranasal spray  application,  start  of  the  face-attraction  rating  parascan  were:  09h58    27  min; digm,  and  10h44    34  min  and  11h01    35  min,  respectively,  for  OXT and  10h26    42  min;  11h14    44  min  and  11h31    45  min, respectively,  for  PLC;  there  were  no  signiﬁcant  differences between  the  timings  in  OXT  and  PLC  sessions,  p  >  0.05  in  all cases).

Nonverbal  reasoning  IQ  was  assessed  by  the eLPS  (Leistungspru¨fsystem)  subtest  4 (maximum  possible  score  40).  Verbal  IQ  based  on  lexical  decisions  was  assessed  by  the fMWT-A  (Mehrfachwahl-Wortschatz-Intelligenz-Test, Teil  A)  (maximum  possible  score  37),  visual  attention  and  concentration  was  assesses  using  the gd2  (Aufmerksamkeits-  und  Belastungstest d2),  visual  attention  and  task-switching  was  assessed  using  the hTMT-A  and  TMT-B  (trail-making  test  A,  B)  (results  displayed  in  seconds), working  memory  performance  was  assessed  using  the  digit-span  forward  and  backward  test  (maximum  possible  score  14).  Depressive symptoms  were  assessed  by  the  self-report iBDI  (Beck’  Depression  Scale,  Version  II).  Oxytocin  enhances  attractiveness  of  unfamiliar  female  faces  independent  of  the  dopamine  reward  system   77  Study  design.  Participants  self-administered  oxytocin  (OXT)  or  placebo  (PLC)  45  min  prior  to  the  behavioral  task  and  60  min Fig.  1  prior  to  the  start  of  the  PET session.  In  the  ﬁrst  session  group  I  was  treated  with  OXT,  followed  by  the  behavioral  task  A  (n  =  5);  group  II received  OXT,  followed  by  the  behavioral  task  B  (n  =  4);  group  III  received  PLC,  followed  by  task  A  (n  =  4);  and  group  IV  received  PLC, followed  by  task  B  (n  =  5).  In  the  second  session  they  received  the  alternate  preparation  (OXTor  PLC)  and  the  alternate  task  (set  A  or  B). The  two  sessions  of  testing  were  separated  by  at  least  4  days.  60  min  and  120  min  after  OXT  or  PLC  application.  Samples were  immediately  centrifuged,  the  plasma  mixed  with 0.1  mg/ml  Aprotinin  (Sigma,  3—8  TIU/mg)  and  then  frozen and  stored  at   80  8C  prior  to  assay.  Plasma  OXT  concentrations  were  determined  by  radio-immunoassay  as  previously described  (Neumann  et  al.,  2013).  To  exclude  anatomical abnormalities  in  the  CNS  and  to  carry  out  co-registration  of the  anatomical  data  with  the  PET  results,  a  high-resolution T1-weighted  MRI  scan  was  acquired  from  each  subject  after one  of  the  PET  scan  sessions.  2.3.  Behavioral  task  Participants  were  placed  inside  the  scanner  and  allowed  to acclimate  to  it  for  at  least  10  min  (Siemens  ECAT  EXAT  HR+ scanner,  see  below)  before  performing  the  face-attraction rating  task.  In  total,  subjects  were  exposed  to  302  stimuli, i.e.  151  in  each  PET  session.  Stimuli  consisted  of  size-  and luminance-adjusted  color  pictures  of  neutral  female  faces displayed  on  a  neutral  background,  and  were  presented  in  a random  order  for  3  s  each  on  a  computer  screen  in  front  of the  subject.  Participants  were  instructed  to  ﬁxate  the stimuli  and  to  answer  the  question  ‘‘How  attractive  was this  face?’’  after  each  picture.  The  attractiveness  ratings were  obtained  on  a  9-point  Likert  scale  (1  =  unattractive; 9  =  very  attractive)  by  a  button  press  on  a  moving nine-button  device  that  started  at  point  1  or  point  9  in  a random  order.  The  inter-stimulus  intervals  (ISIs)  ranged between  8  s  and  22  s.  In  total,  the  attractiveness  task lasted  approximately  45  min.  Stimulus  presentation  and response  registration  was  controlled  using  Presentation 14.4  (Neurobehavioral  Systems,  Albany,  CA).  2.4.  Statistical  analyses  Behavioral  data  were  analyzed  using  SPSS  19  (SPSS  Inc., Chicago,  IL).  Frequency  counts  of  scores,  classiﬁcations  of faces  in  ascending  order  of  average  scores  obtained  under PLC  and  random  permutations  of  these  for  comparison  by  Tstatistics  were  generated  using  Microsoft  Excel  2003.  Behavioral  data  were  analyzed  (a)  in  a  within-subject across-faces  approach  comparing  the  frequencies  of  all  discrete  scores  (i.e.  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8  and  9)  under  OXTand  PLC, and  (b)  in  a  within-face  approach  by  classifying  the  face  images according  to  their  attractiveness  valence  and  assessing  the class-wise  individual  and  group  OXT  response  above  expectation.  In  (b)  for  each  of  the  302  faces  the  average  scores  given under  OXTand  under  PLC  were  calculated.  As  each  subject  saw each  face  only  once,  each  face  was  rated  by  9  subjects  under OXTand  9  other  subjects  under  PLC.  To  further  analyze  the  OXT effect  we  binned  the  302  faces  into  5  classes  of  60  or  61  images in  ascending  order  of  the  attractiveness  rating  given  by  the  9 subjects  under  PLC.  In  order  to  assess  the  consistency  of  the data,  for  general  comparability  and  for  the  determination  of cut-off  values  other  classes  of  faces  of  variable  sizes  and delimitations  were  also  analyzed,  e.g.  classes  comprising images  rated  below  4.5,  between  5  and  6  and  above  5  under PLC.  The  raw  difference  OXT—PLC  is  not  a  suitable  outcome measure  as  it  depends  on  the  valence  of  images,  especially  as here  the  subjects  saw  each  image  only  once  and  the  second rating  was  performed  using  different  stimulus  pictures.  In  the extreme  case,  an  image  rated  9  cannot  be  rated  better  at  the second  trial.  The  trial-re-trial  difference  of  scores  per  class  is not  zero  at  a  random  distribution  (regression  to  the  mean, RTM-effect)  but  the  expected  value  minus  the  individual  or class  value  at  the  ﬁrst  trial.  Here,  we  considered  the  average score  of  all  ratings  for  all  302  images  under  PLC  as  the  expected value.  Individual  responses  to  valence-classes  of  images  Dr were  calculated  for  a  given  subject  ‘‘a’’  and  a  face-class  ‘‘C’’  as Dr  =  (OXTa,C    PLCa,C)     (PLCGlb    PLC1—18,C),  with  OXTa,C, PLCa,C average  score  given  by  subject  ‘‘a’’  to  the  faces  of  a class  ‘‘C’’  either  under  PLC  or  under  OXT;  PLCGlb =  4.899  global average  of  all  ratings  under  PLC;  PLC1—18,C,  average  rating  of all  18  subjects  for  the  faces  of  class  ‘‘C’’.  For  the  group  average per  class  the  equation  simpliﬁes  to  Dr  =  OXT1—18,C    PLCGlb. All  reported  p-values  are  two-tailed  and  p  <  0.05  was considered  (BPND)  values obtained  by  PET  were  compared  using  paired  T-tests  for repeated  measures.  For  measures  in  subregions  the  p  threshold  was  Bonferroni-adjusted.  Power  estimates,  effect  sizes and  b  error  probabilities  were  calculated  using  G*Power  signiﬁcant.

All image  processing  steps  were  carried  out  using  PMOD  (PMOD Technologies  LTD.,  version  3.1,  Zurich,  Switzerland)  and SPM8  software  (Wellcome  Trust  Centre  for  Neuroimaging, London,  United  Kingdom;  http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/ spm)  implemented  in  Matlab  7  (The  MathWorks  Inc.,  Natick, MA).  2.5.  Positron  emission  tomography  and   speciﬁc   al.,   2008).   Injected   radioactivity   All  participants  were  placed  in  supine  position  in  a  Siemens ECAT  EXAT  HR+  scanner  with  their  head  ﬁxed  in  canthomeatal orientation  using  a  vacuum  pad.  Head  position  was  continuously  monitored  by  a  video  system  and  reference  skin  marks and  manually  corrected,  if  necessary.  The  visual  interactive paradigm  was  started  15  min  before  tracer  injection  and continued  for  30  min.  In  parallel,  for  each  of  the  two  scans, a  ten-minute  transmission  scan  using  a 68Ge/68Ga  line  source was  performed  for  attenuation  correction.  Subsequently, [11C]raclopride  was  injected  by  a  motor  syringe  over 1  min.  The  tracer  was  prepared  at  high  speciﬁc  radioactivity (>81    39  GBq  mmol 1)  as  described  previously  (Schott et  to 242    19  MBq  radioactivity was  >  42    23  GBq  mmol 1 and  >  47    26  GBq  mmol 1,  and mean  mass  was  <  2.6    1.2  mg  and  <  2.3    1.0  mg  for  the ﬁrst  and  second  scan,  respectively.  There  were  no  signiﬁcant differences  for  any  of  these  radioligand  parameters.  Dynamic PET  scanning  was  performed  for  60  min.  PET  data  were acquired  into  the  dynamic sequence  of  6    5  s,  3    10  s,  4    60  s,  2    150  s,  2    300  s and  4    600  s  (Lammertsma  and  Hume,  1996).  Individual high-resolution  MRI  scans  were  acquired  using  a  Siemens  Trio 3T  scanner  in  a  3D  T1-weighted  magnetization-prepared rapid  acquisition  gradient-echo  sequence  (192  axial  slices, voxel  TR  =  2200  ms; TE  =  3.93  ms;  ﬂip  angle  =  158;  scan  time  =  8  min)  to  exclude abnormalities  in  the  CNS  and  to  enable  co-registration  of  the anatomical  MRI  and  PET  data.  1  mm    1  mm    1  mm;   list  mode  and  reframed   248    5  MBq,   amounted   in   size   2.6.  Image  processing  and  generation  of parametric  maps  All  image  processing  steps  were  carried  out  using  PMOD  and SPM8  software  packages.  MR  images  were  manually  realigned to  the  anterior  commissure/posterior  commissure  line. Dynamic  PET  series  were  realigned  to  the  average  of  1— 10  min  p.i.  using  SPM  and  for  the  subsequent  steps  using PMOD.  The  averages  of  10—60  min  p.i.  from  the  realigned series  were  co-registered  to  the  individual  MRI.  The  calculated  transformation  was  applied  to  all  individual  frames. Parametric  maps  were  generated  from  the  series  of  dynamic 0 frames  using  the  non-invasive  Logan  model  with  ﬁxed  k2 (OXT,  0.256    0.02;  PLC,  0.253    0.02)  in PMOD  as  multilinear  reference  tissue  model  2  (MRTM2)  using the  cerebellum  as  reference  region.  Modeling  was  started  at 10  min  p.i.  The  outcome  parameter  (binding  potential,  BPND) is  deﬁned  as  ratio  of  the  speciﬁcally  bound  and  non-displaceable  radioligand  in  the  tissue  at  equilibrium.  While  BPND is essentially  derived  from  the  late  phase  of  radioligand distribution,  the  early  phase  of  a  measurement  provides  implemented   information  about  the  relative  tracer  delivery  rate  R1.  As the  uptake  of  [11C]raclopride  is  quick,  R1  is  a  good  surrogate measure  of  regional  brain  perfusion  (Stokes  et  al.,  2010). Parametric  images  of  R1,  which  is  the  ratio  of  the  inﬂux  rate constants  into  the  speciﬁc  compartment  (K1)  and  the  reference  compartment  (K10),  were  also  obtained  with  the  MRTM2 model.  Modeling  started  at  the  earliest  possible  time  point determined  individually  by  the  software  at  1.15  min  (range 0.4—2.5  min)  in  the  OXT  and  at  1.03  min  (range  0.4—1.5)  in the  PLC  scans,  respectively.  2.7.  Analysis  of  parametric  maps  Parametric  maps  of  scans  1  and  2  were  analyzed  by  a  volume of  interest  (VOI)-based  analysis  (VBA)  and  conﬁrmed  by voxel-wise  statistics  using  SPM8.  Striatal  VOIs  (Table  2)  were manually  delineated  onto  the  individual  average  images  of the  parametric  maps  of  scan  1  and  scan  2.  Other  VOIs (cortical  regions,  thalamus,  and  amygdala;  Table  3)  were delineated  onto  individual  co-registered  MRIs.  All  VOIs  were subsequently  read  out  in  the  respective  individual  map. Parametric  maps  of  BPND and  R1  were  warped  into  MNI standard  space  using  the  transformation  determined  from the  individual  MRI  (present  with  isotropic  2  mm3 voxels)  to the  Montreal  Neurological  Institute  (MNI)/International  Consortium  for  Brain  Mapping  (ICBM)  152  T1  template  as  supplied with  SPM.  Voxels  outside  the  brain  were  masked  using  the binary  entire  brain  mask  supplied  with  SPM.  The  images  were smoothed  with  a  3  mm3 Gaussian  kernel.  A  voxel  wise  T-test for  repeated  measures  was  calculated  using  the  following parameters:  proportional  scaling  to  a  mean  of  50;  masking  at an  absolute  threshold  of  0  for  BPND and  at  a  relative  threshold of  0.8  for  R1;  global  calculation  of  mean  voxel  value  within per  image  full  mean/8  masks,  without  non-sphericity  correction.  The  p  threshold  was  set  at  p  =  0.001  and  the  k  threshold at  k  =  3.  Individual  values  in  warped  space  were  read  out  from spherical  VOIs  of  3  mm  radius  centered  at  the  signiﬁcant cluster.  The  Collin  single  subject  T1  MRI  implemented  in  SPM served  for  visualization  of  signiﬁcant  clusters.  Changes  in sub-regions  identiﬁed  by  SPM  were  further  assessed  by  a conﬁrmatory  VBA  in  individual  space.  The  location  of  signiﬁcant  clusters  within  cytoarchitectonically  deﬁned  anatomical  regions  was  determined  using  the  SPM  anatomy  toolbox and  related  maps  (Eickhoff  et  al.,  2005).  3.  Results  3.1.  Oxytocin  blood  concentrations  and behavioral  task  analysis  Following  24  I.U.  of  intranasal  OXT,  plasma  concentrations were  raised  signiﬁcantly  by  a  factor  of  1.5—8.1.  Mean    SD concentrations  under  PLC  were  7.4    5.6  pg/ml  and  baseline concentrations  prior  to  OXT were  7.8    4.6  pg/ml.

Indeed,  all  18  subjects  showed  an  increased  average  attractiveness  rating  under  OXT  compared  to  PLC  (Fig.  2).  To  test for  possible  sequence  effects  of  treatment  on  attractiveness ratings,  we  conducted  a  Wilcoxon  rank  sum  test.  There  was neither  a  main  effect  of  behavioral  trial  sequence  (set  A  then B  or  set  B  then  A)  (W  =  36;  p  =  0.73)  nor  of  sequence  by  drug treatment  (OXT,  PLC)  (W  =  45;  p  =  0.73).  Furthermore,  we detected  no  habituation  effects  during  the  45  min  duration  of the  task;  neither  did  ratings  given  in  the  last  10  min  of  the task  differ  from  those  given  in  the  ﬁrst  10  min  (  p  =  0.59)  nor did  any  other  10  min  subdivisions  of  different  time  spans  yield any  signiﬁcant  differences  in  ratings.  Rating  scores  of  6,  7  and  8  were  given  signiﬁcantly  more frequently  under  OXT  vs  PLC  and  conversely  scores  of  3  and  4  less  frequently  (  p  <  0.05  in  both  cases).  Scores  of  1  and  2 were  only  given  in  10%  of  cases  under  PLC  and  scores  of  9  in only  2%.  Of  the  302  faces,  5  were  scored  in  the  range  2—3,  23  in  the range  3—4,  119  in  the  range  4—5,  139  in  the  range  5—6,  and  16 in  the  range  6—7  under  PLC  (ratings  were  available  from  9 subjects  for  282  and  231  faces,  from  8  subjects  for  20  and  60 faces  and  from  7  subjects  for  0  and  11  faces  under  OXT  and PLC,  respectively).  The  increase  in  the  overall  average  rating score  was  mostly  explained  by  a  scoring  of  more  attractive faces  above  expectation  (  p  <  0.05  for  all  classes  of  60  face stimuli  scored  better  than  4.4  under  PLC,  p  <  0.0005  above  a score  of  4.9).  The  least  attractive  faces  (PLC  scores  of  <4.4) tended  to  be  rated  worse  than  expectation  although  this  did not  achieve  signiﬁcance  (  p  >  0.05;  Fig.  2).  Oxytocin  enhances  attractiveness  of  unfamiliar  female  faces  independent  of  the  dopamine  reward  system   81  Effects  obtained  by  intranasal  application  of  24  IU  oxytocin  (OXT).  (A)  Plasma  levels  raised  signiﬁcantly  (  p  <  0.0003)  by  a Fig.  2  factor  of  1.5—8.1  vs  placebo  (PLC)  and  baseline  (BL).  (B)  and  (C)  Participants  rated  unfamiliar  female  faces  as  more  attractive.  In  (B) this  effect  is  demonstrated  by  the  frequency  of  each  rating  score  (between  1  and  9)  given  under  OXT  normalized  to  the  frequency  of  this rating  score  under  PLC.  Under  PLC  on  average  20%  of  faces  were  scored  5,  18%  4  and  6;  13%  3  and  7;  6%  2  and  8;  4%  1  and  2%  9.  Asterisks mark  scores  where  the  frequencies  differed  signiﬁcantly  (  p  <  0.05)  between  OXT  and  PLC  in  this  within-subject  comparison  across  all 302  faces.  (C)  Shows  the  analysis  of  OXT effects  across  the  range  of  rating  scores.  Faces  were  classiﬁed  in  ascending  order  of  the  mean score  obtained  from  subjects  under  PLC.  It  can  be  seen  that  only  faces  rated  more  attractive  than  4.8  under  PLC  were  rated signiﬁcantly  better  under  OXT  (*p  <  0.001  for  4.8—5.0  and  <0.000005  for  both  5.1—5.3  and  5.4—6.6).  (D)—(F)  correlations  of  the striatal  perfusion  change  (relative  tracer  delivery  rate  R1)  and  individual  rating  changes  (Dr)  above  expectation  for  classes  of  more attractive  (D,  F)  and  less  attractive  (E)  faces.  Dr  describes  the  individual  change  of  rating  of  a  class  A  of  images  above  the  change expected  for  the  group  at  random  distribution;  Dr  =  (OXTa,C    PLC a,C)     (PLCGlb    PLC1—18,C),  with  OXTa,C,  PLC a,C average  score  given by  subject  a  to,  e.g.  the  faces  of  a  class  C  either  under  PLC  or  under  OXT;  PLCGlb =  4.899  global  average  of  all  ratings  under  PLC;  PLC1— 18,C,  average  rating  of  all  18  subjects  for  the  faces  of  class  A.  Perfusional  activation  of  the  left  accumbens  (D)  was  only  signiﬁcantly positively  correlated  with  highly  attractive  faces  (scores  of  >5).  For  the  left  caudate  changes  in  perfusion  were  negatively  correlated with  altered  ratings  of  scores  considering  the  class  of  poorly  attractive  faces  (rated  <  4.5  under  PLC)  and  positively  correlated  with  in the  class  of  highly  attractive  faces  (rated  >  5).  3.2.  [11C]raclopride  binding  in  brain  reward regions  3.3.  [11C]raclopride  binding  in  other  brain regions  Subjects  showed  no  differences  in  [11C]raclopride  BPND for the  whole  striatum  or  any  functional  striatal  subdivision between  OXT  and  PLC  treatments  (Table  2  and  Fig.  3)  There were  also  no  differences  in  pallidum  or  substantia  nigra. Relative  changes  were   0.4%  in  the  entire  striatum  and 0.5%  in  the  NAcc  (averages  of  left  and  right).  Respective standard  deviations  were  3.8%  and  4.7%  within  and  13.1%  and 15.5%  between  subjects.  Given  these  variances  in  BPND measures,  power  analysis  showed  that  the  relative  change  of  D2R BPND following  administration  of  24  IU  of  OXT  is  <2.9%  in  the entire  striatum  and  <3.6%  in  the  NAcc,  respectively,  with  a 95%  conﬁdence  level.  According  to  data  from  combined [11C]raclopride  and  DA-microdialysis  sampling  experiments (Tsukada  et  al.,  1999)  this  would  correspond  to  calculated changes  in  DA  levels  of  <290%  and  <360%,  respectively. Regional  DA  release  did  not  correlate  with  changes  of  OXT plasma  concentrations  nor  with  rating  changes  for  any  class of  faces  or  any  frequency  of  scores.  Pearson’s  r2 was  below 0.1  in  all  striatal  subregions  and  below  0.01  in  the  entire striatum.  SPM  analysis  of  BPND maps  revealed  no  decreases  after  OXT but  two  clusters  with  increases  (i.e.  less  DA  release)  in  the right  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC)  and  in  the  right superior  parietal  gyrus  (SPG)  (Table  2  and  Fig.  3).  In  contrast, perfusion  at  these  sites  was  signiﬁcantly  reduced.  This  mismatch  speaks  against  perfusion-related  artifacts  since  areas with  higher  perfusion  usually  show  increased  radioligand uptake  and  higher  apparent  BPND (Logan  et  al.,  1994).  However,  there  were  no  signiﬁcant  correlations  between  BPND in these  clusters  and  blood  concentrations  (r2 <  0.12)  or  any behavioral  measure  (r2 <  0.21).  in   the   left  dmPFC  and   0.014   for  D2R  BPND decreases  of   0.011   The  VOI-based  analysis  of  large  cortical  regions  showed ( 7,4%, trends  DR1  =   0.026)  ( 5%, DR1  =   0.009)  in  the  right  thalamus,  and  an  increase  of 0.024  (+15%,  DR1  =  0.011)  in  the  right  amygdala,  although without  reaching  signiﬁcance.  Overall  these  results  provide no  indication  of  a  local  increase  of  DA  release  under  OXT treatment  compared  with  PLC.  Moreover,  no  correlation  of changes  of  BPND in  extra-striatal  regions  and  attractiveness  82   N.  Striepens  et  al.  Results  of  [11C]raclopride  PET  imaging.

At  the  level  of  p  <  0.001  no  decrease  was  detected  and  two  clusters of  increase,  one  in  the  right  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (dmPFC)  located  within  the  supplementary  motor  cortex  (BA6)  and  another one  in  the  right  ventral  intraparietal  area  (VIP)  (Table  2).  (D)  SPM  analysis  of  R1  at  the  level  p  <  0.001  yielded  no  increase  and  two signiﬁcant  decreases  —  one  in  the  right  dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex  (BA8)  and  another  one  in  the  left  lateral  precentral  gyrus  (BA6). Shown  are  the  data  of  a  comparison  at  p  <  0.05.  Under  OXT  higher  blood  ﬂow  occurred  in  the  following  regions:  left  anterior  insula, subgenual  and  posterior  cingulum,  nucleus  accumbens,  and  fusiform  gyrus;  right  superior  parietal  gyrus  and  medial  frontal  gyrus (BA11).  Planum  temporale  showed  higher  activation  bilaterally.  Lower  perfusion  was  observed  bilaterally  in  a  large  portion  of  the dmPFC  spanning  into  the  dorsal  cingulum  and  bilaterally  into  the  inferior  frontal  gyrus,  pars  opercularis.  This  switch  is  between patterns  with  large  similarities  to  what  has  been  described  in  the  fMRI  literature  as  a  cognitive  network  (decrease,  blue)  and  a  social network  (increase,  red).

Patterns  of  perfusion  changes  (R1)  When  assessed  by  VOI-based  analysis,  changes  in  R1  did  not exceed  the  range  of   2.6%  to  1.7%  (or  DR1  =   0.026  to DR1  =  0.016)  which  was  reached  in  the  left  superior  frontal and  left  orbitofrontal  cortex  (OFC),  respectively.  In  the  right  OFC  there  was  an  increase  of  R1  of  3.9%  which  was  close  to signiﬁcance  (DR1  =  0.037;  p  =  0.06).  SPM  analysis  of  R1  maps at  a  level  of  p  <  0.001  did  not  detect  any  increase  but revealed  two  clusters  with  signiﬁcant  decreases  at  the  midline  in  the  dmPFC  (BA8,   10%,  p  =  0.0002)  and  in  the  handarm  region  of  the  left  motor  cortex  (BA6,   12%,  p  =  0.00003) (Table  2  and  Fig.  3).  At  these  sites  BPND was  also  signiﬁcantly reduced,  albeit  to  a  lower  extent.  In  order  to  make  a  wider assessment  of  activation  patterns  we  also  used  SPM  to  Oxytocin  enhances  attractiveness  of  unfamiliar  female  faces  independent  of  the  dopamine  reward  system   83  compare  R1  data  at  a  level  of  p  <  0.05  (Fig.  3).  Under  OXTwe observed  a  higher  blood  ﬂow  in  the  anterior  insula  (at  the  MNI coordinates,  x  y  z,   36  14   4),  the  rostral  cingulate  (cingulate-p24/s24,   2  34   4)  extending  into  the  OFC,  the  posterior  cingulate  ( 6   44  30),  the  NAcc  ( 8  16   12),  and  the fusiform  gyrus  ( 34   30   24)  of  the  left  hemisphere  and  in the  anterior  angular  gyrus/inferior  parietal  cortex  (area  IPCPG  a/p,  46   64  44)  and  the  medial  frontal  gyrus  (BA10,  32  60 4)  of  the  right  hemisphere.  Planum  temporale  showed  higher bilateral  activations  ( 62   30   4  and  50   18   14).  Lower perfusion  was  observed  bilaterally  in  a  large  portion  of  the dmPFC  (BA8,  4  40  38)  extending  into  the  dorsal  cingulate (cingulate-320  2  34  42)  and  the  inferior  frontal  gyrus,  pars opercularis  (OP4,   56   10  10  and  OP4,  56  2  6),  as  well  as  in the  left  frontal  pole  (FP1,   22  64  10)  and  the  right  caudal inferior  temporal  lobe  (54   54  0  and  54   50   16).  Changes  in  brain  perfusion  (R1)  and  OXT  levels  correlated inversely  in  the  left  insula  (r  =  0.66,  p  <  0.003),  bilaterally  in the  ACC,  right  parietal,  left  temporo-lateral  and  in  the  left amygdala  (all  r  =  0.50,  p  <  0.04).  The  above  expected increase  in  ratings  of  the  more  attractive  faces  —  for  those 159  of  302  faces  with  scores  larger  than  5  under  PLC  — correlated  positively  with  the  overall  change  of  R1  in  all 2    6  striatal  regions  (r  =  0.51—0.73;  p  <  0.03—<0.0007) with  left  accumbens (r  =  0.74,  p  <  0.0005,  Fig.  2)  and  left  caudate  (r  =  0.70, p  <  0.002,  Fig.  2).  However,  there  was  no  positive  correlation for  the  right  caudate  or  the  left  anterior  putamen.  On  the other  hand,  rating  changes  for  the  less  attractive  faces  —  the set  of  73  of  302  faces  with  scores  lower  than  4.5  under  PLC  — correlated  negatively  with  R1  in  the  left  caudate  (Fig.  2).  No other  signiﬁcant  correlations  between  attractiveness  ratings and  regional  BPND or  R1  were  observed.  signiﬁcant  being   the  most   the   3.5.  Test-retest  reliability  of  BPND  In  order  to  compare  the  quality  and  validity  of  our  data  we assessed  measures  of  test-retest  reliability  in  striatum  and representative  cortical  areas.  These  data  provide  an  estimate  for  the  test—retest  reliability  —  given  as  average  of  the relative  differences,  rd  =  j(scan2/scan1)     1j.  Values  for  rd were  5.0%  (4.0%)  in  the  striatum,  7.8%  (6.8%)  in  the  NAcc, 6.9%  (5.4%)  in  the  occipital  cortex,  and  6.3%  (5.6%)  in  the temporal  cortex.  BPND values  in  the  second  scan  (retest)  were systematically  higher  in  the  striatum  (1.7%)  and  lower  in  NAcc (0.7%),  occipital  cortex  (0.1%),  and  temporal  cortex  (0.4%). In  the  left  caudate  the  increase  of  retest  BPND reached  3.4% (6.6%)  corresponding  to  a  signiﬁcance  level  of  p  =  0.04, which  was  still  above  the  Bonferroni  threshold  of  p  =  0.005 for  analysis  of  all  10  striatal  subregions.  A  further  measure  of test-retest  reliability  in  relation  to  between-subject  variability  is  the  intra-class  correlation  coefﬁcient  (ICC)  which  was 0.87  for  the  entire  striatum,  0.85  for  the  NAcc,  0.80  for  the occipital  cortex  and  0.89  for  the  temporal  cortex,  respectively.  4.  Discussion  In  this  randomized,  double-blind,  PLC-controlled,  crossover study  we  have  for  the  ﬁrst  time  directly  investigated  the potential  interaction  between  exogenous  OXT  application  and  endogenous  DA  release  in  the  human  brain  using [11C]raclopride  PET.  Our  results  show  that  neither  OXT  per se  nor  its  effect  on  attractiveness  ratings  for  unfamiliar female  faces  resulted  in  altered  DA  release  in  the  striatum of  healthy  young  male  subjects.  Similarly,  no  changes  were observed  in  other  reward-related  brain  areas  such  as  the pallidum.  Thus,  there  was  no  evidence  to  support  the  hypothesis  that  OXT-induced  increased  attractiveness  ratings  for unfamiliar  faces  in  humans  are  associated  with  increased dopaminergic  activity  in  reward-related  brain  areas  (Skuse and  Gallagher,  2009;  Theodoridou  et  al.,  2009).  On  the  other hand,  we  observed  reduced  DA  release  in  subregions  of  the dmPFC  and  SPG,  although  this  did  not  correlate  with  either plasma  OXT  concentrations  or  behavioral  attraction  ratings. The  absence  of  evidence  for  an  OXT-induced  increase  in  DA activity  in  brain  reward  systems  was  obtained  despite  intranasal  OXT  treatment  ﬁrstly  signiﬁcantly  increasing  plasma OXT  concentrations  for  the  entire  duration  of  the  PET  scan; secondly  evoking  a  robust  increase  in  perceived  attraction  of the  unfamiliar  female  face  stimuli  used,  and  thirdly  increasing  activity,  in  terms  of  brain  perfusion,  in  the  striatum (caudate  and  nucleus  accumbens)  and  many  brain  regions involved  in  face  stimulus  processing.  Some  of  these  latter activity  changes  were  also  signiﬁcantly  correlated  with plasma  OXT  concentration  and/or  behavioral  rating  changes. Overall  therefore  our  ﬁndings  strongly  support  a  conclusion that  intranasal  OXT  (at  a  24  IU  dose)  does  not  alter  DA  release in  brain  reward  regions  per  se,  and  also  that  its  facilitation  of perceived  face  attraction  can  occur  in  the  apparent  absence of  altered  DA  release  despite  increasing  striatal  activity. Thus,  while  OXT  may  still  potentially  act  on  striatal  brain reward  regions  to  facilitate  attraction  it  may  not  do  so  via interactions  with  DA.  In  the  current  study  while  OXT-induced  overall  increases in  perceived  attractiveness  of  unfamiliar  faces  in  all  18 subjects,  a  further  analysis  revealed  that  this  effect  primarily occurred  for  the  faces  of  the  subset  of  women  given  higher ratings  (>4.5)  under  PLC  treatment.  Thus  for  around  40%  of the  faces  used  OXT  had  no  measurable  effect  on  increasing perceived  attraction,  indeed  for  the  lowest  attraction  scores there  was  a  trend  toward  OXT  even  reducing  perceived attraction.  Thus  one  potential  explanation  for  the  lack  of a  signiﬁcant  OXT effect  on  striatal  DA  release  might  be  that  it did  not  increase  the  perceived  attractiveness  of  many  of  the face-stimuli  used.  However,  we  did  observe  OXT-induced changes  in  DA  activity  in  other  brain  regions  and  there  were also  perfusion  changes  in  the  striatum  itself,  so  it  is  rather unlikely  that  this  subset  of  faces  with  no  OXT  effect  is responsible  for  the  absence  of  DA  changes.  Another  possible interpretation  for  the  observed  lack  of  OXT  effects  on  the  DA reward  system  is  related  to  the  fact  that  only  faces  of unfamiliar  females  were  presented  in  this  study.  In  addition to  personal  factors  such  as  relationship  status  (Scheele  et  al., 2012,  2013)  and  situational  factors  such  as  social  threat (Grillon  et  al.,  2012;  Striepens  et  al.,  2012),  familiarity may  thus  represent  another  context-dependent  variable  that critically  inﬂuences  OXT  effects  (Bartz  et  al.,  2011).  While OXT  has  been  implicated  in  strengthening  existing  social bonds  rather  than  creating  them  de  novo  (Grillon  et  al., 2012),  the  present  data  argue  that  OXT  could  actually  play  a key  role  in  the  de  novo  formation  of  male-female  bonds  via  its modulation  of  perceived  attractiveness  of  unfamiliar  84   N.  Striepens  et  al.  females,  however,  without  engaging  the  DA  reward  system. One  intriguing  yet  underexplored  possibility  reconciling these  discrepant  views  is  that  the  DA  reward  system  is  only activated  by  OXT  in  males  if  there  is  already  an  established deep  bond  of  affection  or  romantic  love  with  the  female. Furthermore,  there  is  now  evidence  from  experiments  in mice  that  social  reward  requires  coordinated  activity  of nucleus  accumbens  oxytocin  and  serotonin  (5-HT)  (Do¨len et  al.,  2013),  suggesting  a  key  role  of  serotonergic  innervation  to  the  nucleus  accumbens  in  mediating  the  reinforcing properties  of  social  is  unclear,  though, whether  this  ﬁnding  also  translates  to  the  domain  of  human attraction.  interaction.   It   The  absence  of  OXTeffects  on  the  DA  reward  system  might also  derive  from  the  fact  that  we  tested  only  male  subjects. Research  using  voles  has  established  that  OXT  primarily inﬂuences  pair  bonding  in  females  via  the  striatal  DA  reward system  (Liu  and  Wang,  2003).  In  males,  however,  the  related neuropeptide  arginine  vasopressin  (AVP),  acting  primarily  on the  ventral  pallidum,  seems  to  be  more  important  (Lim  et  al., 2004).  There  is  a  receptor  cross-afﬁnity  between  these  two neuropeptides  whereby  the  selectivity  of  OXT  for  OXT-receptors  over  VP  receptors  (V1A,  V1B,  V2)  is  at  least  20-fold  (c.f. PDSP  Ki database).  Possibly  AVP  or  higher  doses  of  OXT  could therefore  inﬂuence  the  DA  reward  system  in  the  human  brain —  although  there  is  no  supporting  evidence  for  increased  DA activation  in  the  present  study.  It  is  still  an  unresolved question  whether  there  are  OXT  or  AVP  receptors  in reward-related  or  other  DA  regions  of  the  human  brain.  A single  mapping  study  on  the  brains  of  eight  males  and  four females  failed  to  detect  binding  of  either  OXT  or  AVP  in  the striatum  while  some  OXT  binding  was  found  in  substantia nigra  and  pallidum  (Loup  et  al.,  1991).  We  found  no  evidence of  altered  DA  release  in  the  pallidum  which  is  in  line  with previous  studies  showing  that  this  region  is  more  strongly activated  by  maternal  rather  than  by  romantic  attraction (Bartels  and  Zeki,  2004).  In  fact,  the  only  direct  evidence  for OXT  receptor  mRNA  expression  in  the  human  forebrain  has been  described  in  the  temporal  cortex  (Gregory  et  al.,  2010). It  is  therefore  not  surprising  that  we  did  not  see  any  OXTrelated  DA  changes  in  the  substantia  nigra.  The  absence  of  changes  in  DA  release  inﬂuencing  D2R binding  in  the  striatum  are  unlikely  to  be  due  to  a  lack  of sensitivity  of  [11C]raclopride  PET.  Individual  levels  of  the radioligand  binding  were  in  accordance  with  well-established standard  values  for  [11C]raclopride  binding  and  were  highly reproducible.  While  our  task-design  precluded  an  assessment of  resting-state  radioligand  binding,  which  would  have  permitted  conﬁrmation  that  exposure  to  the  face  stimuli  did evoke  striatal  DA  release,  mean  overall  striatal  BPND values (1.94)  were  lower  than  those  reported  by  other  studies  during resting-state  conditions  (Koepp  et  al.,  1998  —  2.36;  Garraux et  al.,  2007  —  2.7)  and  also  lower  than  those  found  in  one  of our  previous  studies  in  similar  aged-subjects  using  neutral valence  visual  stimuli  (a  furnished  room)  (Schott  et  al.,  2008 —  2.00).  Thus  is  seems  likely  that  the  face  stimuli  per  se  in  the present  study  did  evoke  striatal  DA  release  under  PLC  and that  OXT  did  not  inﬂuence  this.  Theoretically,  the  exposure to  task-related  faces  by  itself  might  have  increased  DA release  up  to  a  saturation  point  which  would  render  it impossible  to  detect  any  further  enhancement  by  OXT.  However,  binding  potentials  were  in  the  medium  range  following  the  face-attraction  task  suggesting  that  neither  dose  ceiling nor  threshold  effects  in  the  DA  D2R  system  occurred.  Further, the  faces  used  in  our  study  were  deliberately  chosen  to  be  of medium  attractiveness  and  with  neutral  emotional  expression  and  therefore  any  induced  DA  release  would  have  been substantially  lower  than  that  reported  in  previous  studies using  highly  arousing  stimuli  (Garraux  et  al.,  2007;  Koepp et  al.,  1998).  The  sample  size  of  the  present  study  (n  =  18)  is  in  accordance  with  former  pharmacological  challenges  using [11C]raclopride  PET.  It  was  powered  to  reliably  detect  a 2.9%  difference  in  [11C]raclopride  binding  in  the  striatum. Smaller  effects  are  questionable  in  biological  terms.  The calculated  test-retest  reliability  of  5.0%  is  in  the  range  of previous  reports  (Hirvonen  et  al.,  2003;  Wang  et  al.,  1999; Yoder  et  al.,  2011),  supporting  the  view  that  technical standards  and  sample  size  were  suitable  to  detect  a  signiﬁcant  DA  release  in  the  striatum.  Cortical  test-retest  reliabilities  on  a  per-subject  basis have  not  been  reported  so  far,  although  Stokes  et  al. (2010)  reported  differences  of  group  averages  in  the  range of  0.020,  corresponding  to  about  20%.  While  [11C]raclopride is  widely  used  as  a  striatal  tracer,  some  authors  also  consider it  suitable  for  quantifying  D2R  availability  in  other  brain areas.  Stokes  et  al.  (2010),  for  example,  detected  a  decrease of  BPND in  three  frontal  and  temporal  clusters  under  tetrahydrocannabinol  and  Garraux  et  al.  (2007)  reported  a  decline of  BPND from  0.19  to  0.16  in  the  premotor  cortex  following  a cognitive  learning  task.  Furthermore,  Sawamoto  et  al.  (2008) showed  preserved  anterior  cingulate  DA  release  during  a spatial  working  memory  task  in  early  Parkinson’s  disease (PD)  with  decrease  from  0.28  (negative  control  task)  to 0.21  (target  task).  Nevertheless,  the  preferred  way  for investigating  cortical  DA  would  be  using  another  ligand  of equal  sensitivity  for  endogenous  DA  but  with  greater  sensitivity  to  extra-striatal  regions,  such  as  [18F]fallypride  (Grunder  et  al.,  2006;  Kessler  et  al.,  2005;  Mukherjee  et  al.,  1995). Although  we  failed  to  ﬁnd  evidence  for  OXT-induced  DA release  in  the  current  study,  our  secondary  outcome  measures  of  correlations  between  face  attractiveness  ratings  and brain  perfusional  activation  (R1)  did  reveal  evidence  for changes  in  both  striatal  reward  and  face-processing  regions. The  perfusion  changes  observed  under  OXT  involved  deactivations  in  the  dorsomedial  and  dorsolateral  PFC  and  activations  in  the  ACC,  the  OFC  and  left  insula,  left  accumbens,  left caudatus  and  right  putamen.  These  perfusion  changes  were also  correlated  with  plasma  OXT  concentrations  and/or  with increased  attractiveness  ratings  of  the  faces.  The  ﬁnding  of increased  its  correlation  with enhanced  ratings  of  attractive  faces  under  OXT,  even  in the  apparent  absence  of  a  DA  response,  potentially  suggests that  a  non-dopaminergic  reinforcing  mechanism  might  be involved,  although  we  cannot  entirely  rule  out  the  possibility that  small  amounts  of  DA  below  the  limit  of  detection  were released.  However,  since  we  found  no  evidence  for  DA release  perhaps  a  more  likely  possibility  is  that  OXT  may have  inﬂuenced  opioid  release  and  m-opioid  receptors  which have  also  been  shown  to  be  important  for  pair-bonding  in monogamous  voles  (Burkett  et  al.,  2011).  Interestingly, another  recent  study  has  also  reported  an  increase  in  activity in  the  left  caudate  associated  with  OXT  facilitation  of  mutual cooperation  in  the  Prisoner’s  dilemma  task  (Rilling  et  al.,  striatal  activation  and   Oxytocin  enhances  attractiveness  of  unfamiliar  female  faces  independent  of  the  dopamine  reward  system   85  2012).  Thus  OXT  facilitation  of  perceived  attraction  and social  cooperation  may  share  a  common  mechanism.  In  addition,  there  is  now  evidence  to  suggest  interactions  between nucleus  accumbens  oxytocin  and  serotonin  in  mediating social  reward  (Do¨len et  al.,  2013).  Our  ﬁndings  showing  OXT-induced  increased  perfusion correlated  with  face  attractiveness  ratings  show  broad overlap  with  brain  regions  involved  in  social  aspects  of  face recognition  (Todorov  et  al.,  2011),  including  the  subgenual, perigenual  and  posterior  cingulum  ( 3   48  29),  left  anterior  insula,  pars  triangularis  of  the  inferior  frontal  gyrus (BA44/45),  and  right  inferior  parietal  cortex  (50   62  38). Previous  reports  have  shown  correlations  with  facial  attractiveness  ratings  in  the  right  OFC  and  anterior  insula  (Tsukiura  and  Cabeza,  2011)  and  in  the  rostral  cingulum extending  into  the  OFC  and  left  anterior  insula  (Bray  and O’Doherty,  2007).  A  previous  study  has  reported  that  OXT increased  insula  and  decreased  IFG  activation  in  response to  emotional  vs  neutral  expression  faces  in  women  (Domes et  al.,  2010).  Together  these  ﬁndings  support  the  view  that OXT  may  be  increasing  attraction  toward  female  strangers both  through  reducing  cognitive  appraisal  and  negative emotional  responses  toward  faces  and  also  by  promoting their  social  relevance.  The  increased  plasma  OXT  concentrations  we  found  following  intranasal  OXT  administration  in  men  are  similar  to those  reported  in  another  study  on  female  subjects  (Domes et  al.,  2010).  A  number  of  regions  we  found  with  reduced perfusions  were  negatively  correlated  with  OXT-concentrations.  These  regions  included  the  bilateral  ACC,  left  insula, right  parietal,  left  temporo-lateral  region  and  the  left  amygdala.  A  number  of  previous  studies  have  reported  reduced amygdala  activity  in  response  to  OXT  treatment  (Bethlehem et  al.,  2013;  Gamer  et  al.,  2010;  Striepens  et  al.,  2011). Deactivations  in  the  right  mPFC  and  right  superior  parietal gyrus  were  also  associated  with  increased  [11C]raclopride binding  suggesting  reduced  DA  release  and  D2R  activity. Interestingly,  deactivations  in  right  medial  prefrontal  and parietal  regions  were  reported  by  Bartels  and  Zeki  (2000, 2004)  in  the  context  of  men  and  women  viewing  pictures  of their  romantic  partners  or  —  in  a  second  study  —  of  women viewing  their  babies.  These  regions  are  involved  in  cognitive aspects  of  face  recognition  (Fusar-Poli  et  al.,  2009;  Katanoda et  al.,  2000;  Todorov,  2012),  responses  to  negative  emotional information  (Goldin  et  al.,  2008),  and  moral  judgments (Greene  and  Haidt,  2002).  It  has  been  supposed  that  individuals  experience  reduced  negative  emotion  and  judgmental responses  toward  their  loved  ones  (Bartels  and  Zeki,  2004; Greene  and  Haidt,  2002).  Thus,  OXT  may  be  reducing  negative  emotional/judgmental  responses  toward  the  viewed  unfamiliar  female  faces  by reducing  frontal  and  parietal  activation  and  corresponding DA  release.  This  would  suggest  that  OXT  is  increasing  attractiveness  ratings  by  reducing  cognitive  appraisal  of  and  negative  emotional  and  judgmental  responses  toward  the  female faces,  rather  than  enhancing  their  reward  value  per  se.  At this  point  however  our  evidence  for  reduced  DA  release  and D2R  binding  following  OXT  administration  should  be  considered  preliminary  and  await  conﬁrmation  using  another  ligand with  greater  sensitivity  for  measuring  DA  release  in  extrastriatal  regions,  such  as  [18F]fallypride  (Grunder  et  al.,  2006; Kessler  et  al.,  2005;  Mukherjee  et  al.,  1995).  Most  of  the  human  studies  showing  behavioral  and  brain effects  of  OXT  have  applied  a  single  24  IU  OXT  dose  followed by  measurements  starting  45  min  later  (MacDonald  et  al., 2011;  Striepens  et  al.,  2011;  Yamasue  et  al.,  2012).  The present  study  followed  these  protocols  giving  a  single  dose of  24  IU  OXT  45  min  prior  to  the  behavioral  task  and  60  min prior  to  the  PET  measurement.  Future  studies  should  evaluate  whether  higher  doses  or  repeated  OXT  administrations or  different  delays  between  OXT  treatment,  task  performance  and  PET  scans  might  be  necessary  to  yield  an  OXTinduced  DA  release  in  the  striatum.  However,  the  application scheme  used  in  the  present  study  is  obviously  sufﬁcient  to induce  a  signiﬁcant  facilitating  effect  on  face  attractiveness and  to  evoke  activity  changes  in  a  number  of  other  brain regions.  In  conclusion,  the  present  study  shows  that  the  neuropeptide  OXT  has  no  signiﬁcant  effect  on  [11C]raclopride binding  in  DA  reward  regions  in  men  despite  promoting  an increase  in  the  attractiveness  ratings  for  unfamiliar  female faces  and  in  striatal  activity.  Striatal  activity  changes  were also  correlated  with  attractiveness  ratings.  Thus  OXT  may be  facilitating  the  attractiveness  of  unfamiliar  female faces  by  acting  on  DA-independent  striatal  reward  systems and/or  via  extra-striatal  effects.  Indeed,  our  preliminary evidence  for  OXT-induced  decreased  DA  release  and  perfusion  in  the  right  dmPFC  and  the  right  SPG,  suggests  that increased  ratings  may  be  partly mediated  by  a  DA-related  reduction  in  cognitive  appraisal, negative  emotion  and  judgmental  responses  in  cortical brain  areas.  However,  DA-independent  activity  changes which  correlated  with  increased  attractiveness  ratings  also occurred  in  a  number  of  other  frontal,  parietal  and  temporal  regions  associated  with  face  recognition  and  cognitive  and  emotional  processing.  face  attractiveness   Role  of  the  funding  source  The  authors  report  no  competing  role  of  the  funding  source with  the  content  of  this  manuscript.

Deﬁcits in this process are related to social abnormalities, impulsiveness, and a number of psychiatric disorders. A range of neural regions play a role in this process, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, determining the speciﬁc functional contribution of each region has proved difﬁcult, in part because reversal learning involves multiple cognitive subprocesses such as error detection, inhibiting responding to formerly rewarded stimuli, and overcoming avoidance of previously punished stimuli. We used fMRI and an experimental task adapted from a recent neurochemical study in marmosets to parse neural responding to subprocesses of reversal learning during choice and feedback trial components. Error-feedback processing was associated with increased activity in dmPFC, dlPFC, and IFG whether participants were overcoming avoidance, inhibiting responding, or performing classic response reversal. Reduced activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was associated with error-feedback processing for response inhibition but not overcoming avoidance. Conversely, there was signiﬁcantly greater activity in anterior dmPFC during error-feedback processing in overcoming avoidance compared to response inhibition. A conjunction analysis conﬁrmed that a striking overlap in activity was observed across the three conditions in IFG, dlPFC, and dmPFC. The results are consistent with conceptualizations of IFG function that emphasize modulating stimulus–response maps rather than purely response inhibition. The approach has implications for models of prefrontal function and neurocognitive perspectives on a range of behavioural abnormalities associated with impairments in decision making.  © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Reversal learning is a critical component of decision making by which behavioural alterations are made when the reinforcement value of available response options change. Difﬁculties with reversal learning, as occurs following lesions to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), are associated with behavioural abnormalities including impulsiveness, disinhibition, and social impropriety (Hornak et al., 2004; Rolls et al., 1994). Reversal learning deﬁcits are also associated with reactive aggression (Mitchell et al., 2006), and a range of psychiatric disorders featuring social impairment including psychopathy (Budhani et al., 2006; Mitchell et al., 2002), severe conduct disorder  ⁎ Corresponding author.

Lesion studies from both human and non-human primates suggest OFC is critical for reversal learning (Dias et al., 1996; Fellows and Farah, 2005; Izquierdo and Murray, 2004; O'Doherty, 2007; Roberts, 2006; Rolls et al., 1994). However, functional neuroimaging studies implicate multiple areas of prefrontal cortex in this process including OFC (O'Doherty et al., 2001), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; Cools et al., 2002; Nagahama et al., 2001), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC; Budhani et al., 2007; Mitchell et al., 2009), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; Mitchell et al., 2009; Remijnse et al., 2005), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; Budhani et al., 2007; O'Doherty et al., 2003a). Studies have also implicated posterior parietal cortex (Glascher et al., 2009; Hampshire and Owen, 2006), and subcortical structures including the amygdala (Budhani et al., 2007; Elliott et al., 2004), and striatum (Hampton and O'Doherty, 2007; Mitchell et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2008) in reversal learning. Although a number of neural regions have been implicated, the speciﬁc functional contribution of each in this context remains unclear.  S.G. Greening et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1432–1441  1433  One reason for this lack of functional speciﬁcity is that reversal learning likely involves multiple components including error detection, inhibiting a response to a previously rewarding stimulus, and overcoming avoidance of a previously punished stimulus. Additionally, in the majority of reversal learning studies to date, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response during response selection and feedback processing have been confounded, making it difﬁcult to distinguish response control processes from contingencychange detection or stimulus–response mapping reconﬁguration. Recently, two components of reversal learning have been dissociated on a neuropharmacological level. In an elegant operant learning experiment, Clarke et al. (2007) found that depleting prefrontal levels of serotonin in marmosets selectively disrupted the capacity to inhibit responding to a previously rewarded response. The manipulation left intact the ability to overcome avoidance of a previously punished stimulus. In the same study, depleting prefrontal levels of dopamine had no effect on either facet of reversal learning. The study was the ﬁrst to fractionate these key reversal components in the same task; however, diffusion of the pharmacological agent made it difﬁcult to determine the relative contribution of lateral and medial regions of prefrontal cortex in this context. This raises the intriguing possibility that hitherto confounded processes in reversal learning (response inhibition versus overcoming avoidance) may map onto distinct subregions of prefrontal cortex. Fractionating these processes in humans with neuroimaging may have important implications not only for reﬁning models of prefrontal cortex function, but also for improving our understanding of the neurocognitive basis for the range of disorders associated with reversal learning deﬁcits.  In the present study we used a variant of Clarke et al.'s (2007) object discrimination task in conjunction with fMRI to delineate the functional neuroanatomy of two neurochemically distinct subprocesses of reversal learning. Speciﬁcally, we sought to uncover neural activity associated with two distinct components of reversal learning: 1) inhibiting responding to a previously rewarded stimulus in favour of a novel one (IR); and 2) overcoming avoidance of a previously punished stimulus to obtain reward (OA). In addition, we designed the experimental trial structure in a manner that enabled us to distinguish the BOLD response to the choice interval (i.e., response selection) from that associated with the feedback interval. This allowed us to address two speciﬁc questions. First, do the conditions of IR and OA engage distinct regions of prefrontal cortex during the choice phase of decision making before feedback is received? Second, do distinct regions of prefrontal cortex reconﬁgure inappropriate stimulus–response mappings across conditions in reaction to negative feedback that precedes response change (cf. Mitchell et al., 2009; Nagahama et al., 2001; O'Doherty et al., 2003a)?  Methods  Subjects  Twenty-ﬁve healthy adults participated in the study. Three participants were excluded from the analysis due to technical difﬁculties (user-interface or computer malfunction). One participant did not perform above chance during the task and was excluded from the analysis, leaving data from 21 participants (10 women, age range 20– 32, mean age 24.5, SD=2.8). All subjects granted informed consent, were in good health, and had no past history of psychiatric problems, neurological disease or head injury as determined by screening and interview using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (First et al., 1997). All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and were right-handed as determined by the Edinburgh handedness inventory (Oldﬁeld, 1971). The study was approved by the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board at the University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.  Experimental task  We adapted an object discrimination reversal learning task used in a recent neuropharmacological lesion study (Clarke et al., 2007) and incorporated design features applied in our previous neuroimaging studies (Mitchell et al., 2009; 2008). On each trial, participants were asked to select one object (fractal image) from a pair displayed against a white computer screen (see Fig. 1). Participants were explicitly told that within each of the object pairs one was associated with positive reinforcement (“You WIN 100 points!”), and the other with negative reinforcement (“You LOSE 100 points!”). Participants were also told that at some point during the task, the object associated with positive reinforcement could change, and that they should change their response accordingly. Each trial consisted of four sequential intervals (Fig. 1) beginning with a ﬁxation interval (250, 550, or 850 ms), followed by a choice interval depicting a pair of objects (1200, 1500, or 1800 ms), a blank screen (500, 800, or 1100 ms), and ﬁnally, a feedback interval (750, 1050, or 1350 ms). The duration of each interval was pseudo-randomized so that all durations were equally represented within each run. Additionally, sixteen “jitter” ﬁxation-only trials (8 x2000 ms and 8 x3000 ms) were presented randomly throughout each run to serve as baseline. The use of variable duration trial elements and jitter trials is an effective means for distinguishing between events that occur within a trial (Grinband et al., 2008; Serences, 2004), and similar designs have been used effectively in decision making research (Hampshire et al., 2009; Hester et al., 2007; Tobler et al., 2009). Participants responded by making a left (index ﬁnger) or right (middle ﬁnger) button press using the right hand. Within each object pair, the relative position was counterbalanced so that they appeared equally on the left and right side of the screen. The task was programmed in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, 2002).  During each run, four distinct object pairs were used corresponding to the four experimental conditions. Following an acquisition phase that varied between 6 and 10 trials (mean of 8), three of the four pairs underwent a value reversal (relearning stage), forming three experimental conditions (varying between 6 and 10 trials per pair per run). The number of relearning trials and the onset time of the reversal for each pair varied across runs for each condition (i.e., within a run, pairs underwent reversals at different times) in a counterbalanced fashion. This manipulation was used to pre-empt the anticipation of speciﬁc contingency changes across runs. In the “classic response reversal” (RR) condition, the value of each object in a pair reversed (i.e., the object associated with 100 points was associated with a loss of 100 points and vice versa). In the “inhibit responding” (IR) condition, the value of the previously rewarded stimulus was reversed (i.e., the object associated with 100 points became associated with losing 100 points) and a novel rewarded object was introduced (associated with winning 100 points) to replace the previously punishing stimulus. In the “overcoming avoidance” (OA) condition, the value of the punished object was reversed so that it became associated with winning 100 points; at the same time, a novel punishing object was introduced, which replaced the previously rewarding stimulus. The fourth experimental condition was a control (CTL) in which the object associations remained unchanged. The trial structure and sample conditions are presented in Fig. 1. Subjects completed six runs that were each 5 min and 18 s in duration. Each run involved new stimuli to insure that participants had to learn new object–reward contingencies. Consequently, participants received 48 acquisition phase and 48 relearning phase trials for each condition. Multiple versions of the same task were produced so that the object pairs that represented each relearning condition were counterbalanced across participants.  MRI data acquisition  Subjects were scanned during task performance using a 3 T Siemens MRI scanner with a 32 channel head coil. Each session began with a  1434  S.G.

Participants were instructed to select one object from a pair as quickly and as accurately as they could. They subsequently received positive feedback (“you WIN 100 points”) or negative feedback (“you LOSE 100 points”). The bottom panels depict the object-reward contingency changes for each pair when switching from the acquisition phase to the relearning phase in a single trial (“+” represents the rewarded object; “−” represents the punished object).  high resolution, T1 weighted, anatomical scan covering the whole brain (repetition time=2300 ms, echo time=4.25 ms; FOV=25.6 cm; 192 axial slices; voxel size=1 mm isovoxels; 256 X 256 matrix). Next, six functional MRI runs were completed in which BOLD changes were measured. The fMRI images were taken with a T2*-gradient echo-planar imaging sequence (repetition time=3000 ms; echo time=30 ms; 120x120 matrix; FOV=24 cm). Complete brain coverage was obtained with 45 slices of 2 X 2 mm in plane with a slice thickness of 2.5 mm, which formed voxels of 2 X 2 X 2.5 mm. Slices were acquired in an interleaved fashion.  fMRI analysis  Individual and group analyses were conducted using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages software (AFNI; Cox, 1996). The ﬁrst four “dummy” volumes of each of the six runs were discarded in order to insure that magnetization equilibrium was reached. Motion correction was completed by registering all BOLD data in each run of the task to the ﬁrst volume of the ﬁrst experimental run, which immediately followed the anatomical image. The dataset for each subject was spatially smoothed (using an isotropic 4 mm Gaussian kernel) and the time series data were normalized by dividing the signal intensity of a voxel at each time point by the mean signal intensity of that voxel for each run and multiplying the result by 100. The resultant regression coefﬁcients represented the percent signal change from the mean activity. To account for voxel-wise correlated drifting, a baseline plus linear drift and quadratic trend were modelled to the time series of each voxel. This produced a beta coefﬁcient and t-value for each voxel and regressor. To perform the group analyses, each individual's data was transformed into the standard space of Talairach and Tournoux. This individual subject analysis was followed by the group analyses described below.  Two separate analyses were conducted for the choice interval and the feedback interval (described below). However, in order to ﬁrst demonstrate that our experimental manipulation successfully dissociated the BOLD response during the choice interval from the BOLD response during the feedback intervals, we performed a 4 (Condition) by 2 (Trial Interval: Choice, Feedback) ANOVA using the BOLD data of the early relearning stage. We examined the effect of trial phase  across conditions in the precentral gyrus using an anatomical region of interest mask. If our manipulation to separate the BOLD response during responding versus feedback was effective, robust activity in the precentral gyrus should be observed during the choice interval compared to the feedback interval across conditions.  Separate regressor models for choice and feedback intervals were developed in order to address our hypothesis regarding IR and OA. Resulting regressors were convolved with a gamma-variate basis function to account for the slow hemodynamic response. The BOLD response was then ﬁt to each of the regressors to perform linear regression modeling.  Choice interval analysis  For the choice interval, regressors were created to capture the “decision making” process for the RR, IR, OA, and CTL conditions, which began with the onset of the object pair choice screen and ended once an object selection was made via button press. Correct responses and errors were modelled separately. Correct responses were separated into early and late trials of the relearning stage for each experimental condition. We were particularly interested in examining early relearning trials given evidence that greater demands are placed on neural systems involved in associative learning and response control during early compared to late exposures to new contingencies (Finger et al., 2008b; Marschner et al., 2008; Milad et al., 2007; Phelps et al., 2004). This resulted in eight regressors being modelled using a variable duration (response time locked) epoch design (Grinband et al., 2008). The early relearning phase included the ﬁrst 4 correct choices that the participant made in each run (24 total, representing half of the mean number of total relearning stage trials), and the late relearning stage was comprised of the remaining correct relearning stage trials. All acquisition trials were modelled separately as regressors of no interest. This allowed us to ﬁrst perform a 4 (condition: RR, IR, OA, CTL) by 2 (Relearning Stage: early, late) ANOVA on the regression coefﬁcients during the choice interval. Follow-up analyses using paired t-tests were performed to delineate the nature of the main effects and interaction. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using AlphaSim with 1000 Monte Carlo iterations on a whole brain EPI matrix to p b0.05 (Ward, 2000). We  S.G. Greening et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1432–1441  1435  signiﬁcant difference in accuracy between OA and IR (p N0.8). In addition, a 4 (Condition: IR, OA, RR, CTL) X 2 (Relearning Stage: Early vs. Late) ANOVA was performed to examine the impact of the experimental conditions on response latency during early and late stage correct trials. This revealed a main effect of condition (F(3,60)=4.02; p b0.05). Collapsing across relearning stage, participants were significantly slower to make their response on the OA condition compared to the CTL (p b0.01) condition. There were no signiﬁcant differences between any of the other conditions. There was also a main effect of relearning stage (F(1,20)=73.94; p b0.001). Pairwise comparisons revealed that participants were signiﬁcantly slower to respond in the early stage of reversal learning compared to the late stage for all conditions (p b0.001). A signiﬁcant condition by relearning stage interaction was also present (F(3,60)=3.22; p b0.05). During the early relearning stage participants responded signiﬁcantly slower in the OA condition compared to the IR (p b0.001), RR (p b0.05), and CTL (p b0.001) conditions. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the response latencies across any of the other conditions during the early stages of reversal. There were also no signiﬁcant differences in response latency across any of the conditions during the late reversal relearning stage.  fMRI results  We examined the main effect of interval (choice versus feedback processing) as a positive control to insure that our manipulation distinguished BOLD responding associated with motor responding versus feedback processing. In line with our expected effect, we observed signiﬁcantly greater activity in the precentral gyrus during  also performed an anatomically derived small volume correction (SVC) for multiple comparisons using AlphaSim with 1000 Monte Carlo iterations on a bilateral amygdala and a bilateral orbitofrontal cortex EPI matrix to p b0.05.  Feedback interval analysis  During the feedback interval, we modelled the BOLD response during both correct and error-feedback across all four conditions in the relearning stage. Speciﬁcally, we modelled only those errorfeedback events that were followed by response change the next time that particular object pair was encountered. Error trials in which participants did not change their response on subsequent trials, or error trials that occurred following the performance of a correct reversal trial occurred infrequently and so were modelled as regressors of no interest. This resulted in eight regressors of interest modeling the feedback interval for each condition using a variable duration epoch design (i.e., the duration of the feedback screen). These regressors of interest were then used to perform key contrasts for the feedback interval. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using AlphaSim with 1000 Monte Carlo iterations on a whole brain EPI matrix to p b0.05 (Ward, 2000).  The current experimental design enabled us to dissociate the feedback interval from the choice interval, and also the response inhibition from overcoming avoidance components of decision making. In order to determine the impact of feedback on distinct regions of prefrontal cortex previously implicated in reversal learning, we followed previous reversal learning studies in contrasting the BOLD response to our error trials versus correct trials (cf. Budhani et al., 2007; Kringelbach and Rolls, 2003; Mitchell et al., 2009; O'Doherty et al., 2001). To address the question of whether distinct regions of prefrontal cortex reconﬁgure stimulus–response mappings in reaction to negative feedback, we contrasted the BOLD response to errorfeedback for each condition with the BOLD response to correct-feedback during the same condition. Thus, four contrasts were performed: 1) an IR error-feedback versus IR correct-feedback contrast; 2) an OA errorfeedback versus OA correct-feedback contrast; 3) an IR error-feedback versus OA error-feedback contrast; and 4) an RR error-feedback versus RR correct-feedback contrast. All four contrasts were thresholded at p b0.005 and corrected to p b0.05 for multiple comparisons. Additionally, we used the erode function in AFNI to break up small “bridges” of active voxels that were connecting disparate regions of the cortex to facilitate interpretation of the results.  Conjunction analysis  We performed a conjunction analyses to determine the extent to which the brain regions sensitive to error-feedback in the IR, OA, and RR conditions were overlapping and distinct. This involved constructing a composite map representing areas that were commonly and uniquely activated in the IR, OA, and RR error-feedback contrasts (threshold at p b0.005). Speciﬁcally, we investigated four combinations of conjunction, IR+OA+RR, IR+ OA, IR+ RR, and OA+RR.  Results  Behavioural results  We performed a repeated-measures ANOVA comparing response accuracy across the four conditions of the relearning stage. This revealed a main effect of condition (F(3,60)=44.12, p b0.001). Followup pairwise comparisons showed that response accuracy was signiﬁcantly higher in the control condition (M=93.8%) relative to all other conditions (p b0.001). Participants were also signiﬁcantly more accurate in the OA (M=81.1%) and IR (M=81.5%) conditions relative to the RR condition (M=75.6%; p b0.005). There was no  Fig. 2.

BOLD changes during the choice interval  In order to determine the impact of condition (RR, IR, OA, and CTL) on the brain's response, we performed a 4 (Condition: RR, IR, OA, CTL) by 2 (Relearning Stage: Early versus Late) ANOVA on the whole brain BOLD data from the choice interval, thresholded at p b0.005 and corrected for multiple comparisons to p b0.05. This revealed a main effect of relearning stage as well as the two results of interest, a main effect of condition and a condition-by-relearning-stage interaction (see Table 1). Follow-up pairwise comparisons were performed to determine the nature of the main effect and interaction (p-values for pairwise comparisons are displayed throughout this section in parentheses).  A signiﬁcant main effect of condition was observed in regions previously implicated in reversal learning including OFC, inferior parietal cortex, and amygdala (OFC and amygdala were small volume corrected p b0.05). Follow-up paired t-tests revealed greater activity for the RR, OA, and CTL conditions compared to the IR condition in the right frontal pole (BA 10; p b0.05; Fig. 2a) and right mOFC (BA 10/13; p b0.001; Fig. 2b). Additionally, greater activity was observed in the left inferior parietal lobe during OA relative to the RR, IR, and the CTL conditions (p b0.01). Consistent with its role in encoding stimulus values (Paton et al., 2006), enhanced activity in the amygdala was observed during all conditions that featured a change in stimulus value relative to the control condition (RR, IR, and OA NCTL condition;  p b0.05; Fig. 2c), and there were no signiﬁcant differences between the three conditions that underwent reversal.  A signiﬁcant condition by relearning stage interaction was observed only in dlPFC (Fig. 3). Within this region of dlPFC, signiﬁcantly enhanced activity was observed to early versus late trials during RR and IR (early Nlate; p b0.05), but not during OA (p N0.4) or CTL conditions (p N0.09). Interestingly, the condition that elicited greatest activity in dlPFC during early trials (RR), showed the least amount of activity in late trials. Indeed, activity elicited in dlPFC to the late stage of RR was signiﬁcantly less than late-stage activity in any other condition (RRlate bIRlate, p b0.05; RRlate bOAlate, p b0.001; RRlate b CTLlate, p b0.05).  BOLD changes during feedback interval  To determine the impact of  feedback across conditions we examined brain activity associated with the processing of errorfeedback on the ﬁnal trial before a correct reversal within a given condition as per previous studies (Cools et al., 2002; O'Doherty et al., 2003a; Remijnse et al., 2005). First, we examined error-related activity during the IR condition (IR error-feedback versus IR correctfeedback; thresholded at p b0.005, corrected to p b0.05; Fig. 4a and Supplemental Table S1). Notably, this contrast revealed increased activity during error-feedback in neural regions associated with response inhibition and control (Aron et al., 2003; Casey et al., 2001), including bilateral IFG. In addition, signiﬁcant activity during errorfeedback was observed in regions implicated in resolving decisional and perceptual conﬂict (Botvinick et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2009), including bilateral dmPFC, bilateral dlPFC, and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (BA 39). There was also enhanced activity bilaterally in the frontal pole (BA 10) in response to error-feedback. Conversely, there was reduced activity in a region of ventromedial PFC (Fig. 5a) implicated in the representation of stimulus-outcome associations during error-feedback relative to correct-feedback (Budhani et al., 2007; Finger et al., 2008a), and the bilateral inferior parietal lobe (BA 40) (Fig. 5b). Second, we examined error-related activity during the OA condition (OA error-feedback versus OA correct-feedback; thresholded at p b0.005, corrected to p b0.05; Fig. 4b and Supplemental Table S1), which also revealed enhanced activity in bilateral dmPFC, bilateral dlPFC, bilateral inferior parietal lobe (BA 39), and the bilateral IFG. In addition, there was signiﬁcantly greater activity in the bilateral frontal pole (BA 10). Conversely, the left hippocampus displayed signiﬁcantly reduced activity during error-relative to correct-feedback. Last, we contrasted the brain activity associated with processing error-related feedback between the two subprocesses of reversal learning (IR error-feedback versus OA error-feedback, thresholded at p b0.005, corrected to p b0.05). This contrast revealed enhanced activity in a region of the left anterior dmPFC and left  Fig. 3. Interaction reveals an effect of relearning stage and condition on dlPFC activity during the choice interval. The condition x relearning stage interaction (threshold p b0.005, corrected to p b0.05) demonstrated differential activity in dorsolateral PFC. Follow-up paired t-tests revealed signiﬁcantly enhanced activity in early versus late trials during RR and IR (p b0.05), and signiﬁcantly less activity in this area during late trials of RR compared to all other conditions. Mean percent change of the BOLD signal within the entire cluster is represented along the y-axis; error bars depict the SEM between subjects.  S.G.

Of note, the conjunction of IR+OA+RR revealed enhanced activity within the bilateral dmPFC (7856 mm3), bilateral dlPFC (right = 9536 mm3, left = 4232 mm3), bilateral frontal pole (right=3200 mm3, left=784 mm3), bilateral IFG (right=536 mm3, left=1784 mm3), and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (right=5504 mm3, left=5496 mm3). Similarly, the conjunction of IR+OA revealed enhanced activity within the bilateral dmPFC (8456 mm3), bilateral dlPFC (right=12,360 mm3, left=5592 mm3), bilateral frontal pole (right= 3880 mm3, left = 1136 mm3), bilateral IFG (right = 584 mm3, left = 1792 mm3), and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (right=10,256 mm3, left=6224 mm3). Overlapping activity during IR+RR was observed within the bilateral dmPFC (10,672 mm3), bilateral dlPFC (right= 11,400 mm3, left=4952 mm3), bilateral frontal pole (right=4136 mm3, left=784 mm3), bilateral IFG (right=1560 mm3, left=2368 mm3), and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (right=6760 mm3, left=5624 mm3). In addition, the conjunction of OA+RR revealed enhanced activity within the bilateral dmPFC (10,360 mm3), bilateral dlPFC (right= 14,968 mm3, left=9416 mm3), bilateral frontal pole (right=5616 mm3, left= 3408 mm3), bilateral IFG (right=1296 mm3, left=3432 mm3), and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (right=7776 mm3, left=19,576 mm3, this cluster spans to include the precuneus).  We then performed a conjunction analysis on regions that displayed a decrease in activity during error-feedback relative to correct Fig. 4.

Conjunction analysis  In order to further determine the extent to which the IR, OA, and RR components of reversal learning activate similar neural regions, we conducted a conjunction analysis in which we quantiﬁed contiguous volumes of activity generated from the error-feedback contrasts (error-feedback versus correct-feedback). Thus we have reported cluster volumes for four conjunctions below: IR+OA+RR, IR+ OA,  Fig. 5.

The contrast involving IR errorfeedback versus IR correct-feedback (threshold p b0.005, corrected to p b0.05) revealed signiﬁcantly reduced activity during error-feedback relative to correct-feedback processing in mPFC (a) and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (b). The contrast involving OA error-feedback versus IR error-feedback (threshold p b0.005, corrected to p b0.05) revealed greater activity during OA in anterior dmPFC (c) and angular gyrus (d).  Fig. 6.

Notably, we observed overlapping activity in only the IR+ RR combination, in a region of mPFC (BA 10/32; 400 mm3).  Discussion  Recently, it has been demonstrated that two subprocesses of reversal learning are dissociable at the neurochemical level (Clarke et al., 2007). Marmosets with selective depletions of prefrontal levels of serotonin showed an impaired ability to inhibit responding to a previously rewarded stimulus. In contrast, the same animals retained the ability to overcome avoidance to a formerly punishing stimulus. This neurochemical manipulation likely inﬂuenced both medial and lateral regions of prefrontal cortex. A remaining question therefore was whether two subprocesses of reversal learning, inhibition of responding (IR) and overcoming avoidance (OA), are neuroanatomically dissociable processes in humans. In the current study, we adapted a similar behavioural manipulation for use fMRI to address this unknown during the choice and feedback intervals of decision making. During the choice interval, differential effects of IR versus OA were observed. Relative to early response inhibition trials, early successful attempts to overcome avoidance were associated with signiﬁcantly enhanced activity in right medial OFC, right frontal pole, cuneus, cerebellum, and inferior parietal cortex. Consistent with its role in encoding stimulus values, enhanced activity during the relearning phase was observed in left amygdala to all stimuli that underwent a contingency change relative to the control condition. Conjunction analysis was performed to quantify the extent of overlap in signiﬁcantly active voxels across conditions. This conﬁrmed that during the feedback interval, similar patterns of activity were observed across trials featuring classic reversals, response inhibition, and overcoming avoidance in dmPFC, dlPFC, IFG, frontal pole, and inferior parietal cortex. Conversely, the contrast of error-feedback versus correct-feedback displayed reduced activity during errorfeedback in the mPFC during the IR and not the OA condition. A ﬁnal contrast uncovered enhanced activity in anterior dmPFC and angular gyrus during OA compared to IR error-feedback processing. The results indicate that overlapping regions of dmPFC, dlPFC, IFG, frontal pole, and parietal cortex are involved in both overcoming avoidance  and response inhibition. However, they indicate that during the choice phase mOFC and lateral frontal pole may play a greater role in overcoming the avoidance of a previously punishing stimulus than in inhibiting a response to a formerly rewarding object.  Neuroimaging studies implicate multiple areas of prefrontal cortex in reversal learning including OFC (O'Doherty et al., 2001), IFG (Cools et al., 2002), dmPFC (Budhani et al., 2007; Mitchell et al., 2009), and dlPFC (Mitchell et al., 2009; Remijnse et al., 2005). Although it is increasingly apparent that these regions play some role in rewardrelated decision making, dissociating the function of each has proved difﬁcult, particularly because even a relatively conﬁned and controlled experimental task such as reversal learning includes several dissociable cognitive functions (Fellows, 2007).  Perhaps the region of prefrontal cortex with the clearest link to reversal learning is OFC. Lesion data from human (Berlin et al., 2004; Fellows and Farah, 2003; Hornak et al., 2004; Rolls et al., 1994) and non-human (Dias et al., 1996) primates are consistent with suggestions that OFC plays a critical role in reversal learning. The OFC is thought to contribute to reversal learning and decision making more broadly by representing expected reward values or behavioural outcomes (O'Doherty, 2007), and updating the incentive value of stimuli when they change (Izquierdo et al., 2004; Rudebeck and Murray, 2008). A recent neuroimaging study has implicated OFC in modulating both approach and avoidant operant learning as a function of reinforcement change (Finger et al., 2008b). In the current study, we observed greater activity in a similar area of mOFC (BA 10/ 32) during the choice interval of the OA condition relative to the IR condition. Deactivation in mOFC in response to unexpected feedback has been interpreted in some cases as evidence of prediction error signaling, when expected reinforcement is not received (Budhani et al., 2007; Finger et al., 2008b; Tobler et al., 2006). However, in the current study, the effect concerns the choice phase of responses before feedback was obtained. One interpretation of this result is that the activity in the choice phase reﬂects the neuronal representation of the expected reward (Schoenbaum and Roesch, 2005; Tanaka et al., 2008). This is consistent with prediction error studies demonstrating a temporal shift in neuronal reward-related ﬁring during learning from the feedback phase to the time that the cue associated with  S.G. Greening et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1432–1441  1439  reward is presented (O'Doherty et al., 2003b; Schultz et al., 2000). One might predict that such an outcome expectancy shift from feedback to cue would be least pronounced for the IR condition, which is the only condition that involves selecting a novel stimulus (i.e., novel stimuli have the least reward history and are therefore least likely to generate a strong outcome expectancy).  In addition to activity in mOFC during choice trials, and in line with previous studies of reversal learning (Budhani et al., 2007; Finger et al., 2008b), we observed signiﬁcantly reduced activity in the mPFC (BA 32/10) in response to error-feedback compared to correct-feedback in the IR and RR conditions. The conjunction of the error-related contrast tests revealed that this effect was overlapping and signiﬁcant only for error-feedback in the IR and RR conditions (Table 3). Consistent with a prediction error conceptualization, these are the only conditions involving errors to stimuli that were previously associated with reward (i.e., the conditions for which an expected reward was not obtained). Future work involving formal prediction error modeling will be required to determine the relative contribution of mPFC to inhibiting responding to previously rewarding stimuli versus overcoming avoidance to previously punishing stimuli.  We also observed activity in superior–lateral regions of frontal pole (BA 10). Although similar regions have been implicated in response change in previous studies (Finger et al., 2008b; Mitchell et al., 2009; 2008; O'Doherty et al., 2003a), this area of frontal pole has received less consideration than other regions of prefrontal cortex. Based on anatomical data, it has been noted that the frontal pole, with connections to dlPFC and sensory regions of temporal lobe, is well positioned to be involved in multi-tasking and complex planning (cf. Petrides, 2005). Functional studies have implicated similar or adjacent areas in exploration behaviour (Daw et al., 2006), monitoring or appraising feedback (Tsujimoto et al., 2010), and representing future alternative choices on the basis of past experience (Boorman et al., 2009). In this study, enhanced activity was revealed in the frontal pole during the RR and OA relative to IR conditions, particularly during the choice interval. In contrast to IR trials, which involve selecting a novel stimulus (i.e., one without a signiﬁcant reward history), the RR, OA and CTL conditions all feature correct responses to stimuli with an established record of reinforcement values. Perhaps choices involving previously encountered stimuli with a signiﬁcant reinforcement history involve greater participation from a system that evaluates the long-term evidence collected in favour of adapting future behaviour (cf. Boorman et al., 2009). In addition, we also observed enhanced activity to error-feedback in anterior dmPFC and angular gyrus during overcoming avoidance relative to response inhibition trials. Activity in these areas of prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex has been given less consideration in reversal learning. The region of dmPFC is anterior to that typically seen in decision making studies, but it has been observed when making decisions during a reward-related gambling task (Rogers et al., 2004). It is also noteworthy that areas of parietal cortex have been implicated in response change in other studies (Hampshire and Owen, 2006). The current study raises the possibility that these regions may play a particular role in processing feedback that signiﬁes the need to overcome avoidance of a particular stimulus. Further study will be required to evaluate this possibility.  Neuroimaging studies have also consistently linked IFG to reversal learning (Budhani et al., 2007; Cools et al., 2002; Mitchell et al., 2009; 2008; Nagahama et al., 2001). However, there are little data concerning the impact of focal lesions to this region on components of decision making, and so the relative importance and precise functional role of IFG in this context is less clear. Aron and his colleagues present compelling lesion data linking right IFG with deﬁcits inhibiting a motor response on a go/no-go task (Aron et al., 2003). Nevertheless, IFG function has not only been conceptualized in terms of motor response inhibition (Aron et al., 2003; Casey et al., 2001), but  also in selecting among competing response options (Budhani et al., 2007; Hampshire et al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 2009; Nagahama et al., 2001; Rushworth et al., 2005), and processing punishment information (O'Doherty et al., 2001). In the current study, there was enhanced IFG activity bilaterally to correct selections during the choice interval across early relearning stage trials. We also observed enhanced IFG activity following a sub-optimal response (i.e., during error-feedback) in both the IR and OA condition, as well as the classic response reversal condition. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that the IFG is involved in modulating the competitive weights of different stimulus response-mappings, rather than being involved in response inhibition or punishment processing per se (Hampshire et al., 2010; Mitchell et al., 2009; 2008; Nagahama et al., 2001). Indeed, such a conceptualization of function would account for results involving not only the current data, but also data gleaned from the stop signal task, reversal learning paradigms, and experiments examining punishment processing.  Imaging studies also consistently implicate dorsal regions of the PFC, notably dmPFC and dlPFC, in reversal learning. Although lesions to these dorsal regions of prefrontal cortex do not affect reversal learning (Fellows and Farah, 2003), they do disrupt more complex, but related, forms of reward-related decision making such as risk aversion learning (Fellows and Farah, 2005; Manes et al., 2002). Recently, it has been shown that activity in overlapping areas of dlPFC and dmPFC are modulated by both reversal errors, and when correct selections are made between two response options of similar as opposed to widely differing values (Mitchell et al., 2009). These data are consistent with the idea that dorsal regions of prefrontal cortex may help resolve conﬂict whether it is perceptual conﬂict driven by opposing stimulus features (cf. Botvinick et al., 2004; Carter et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2006), or decision conﬂict generated by a similarity of reward values among competing response options (Blair et al., 2006; Mitchell et al., 2009; Pochon et al., 2008). In the current study, we observed enhanced activity in the dlPFC and dmPFC in response to early response conﬂict at the start of the relearning phase (i.e., during the choice interval) and to errorfeedback (i.e., during the feedback interval). A signiﬁcant interaction revealed that, within dlPFC, this activity was greatest during the early stages of the RR condition, and least to the same condition during late trials relative to all other conditions. The results are consistent with the idea that activation in this area early on during periods of high decision conﬂict not only facilitates the resolution of conﬂict during early trials, but also that it does so in a manner that may lead to enhanced learning of contingencies, and greater ease of decision making in later trials. It is important to note that if this were the case, it could be predicted that the effect of stage (early versus late) would be greater on the RT to the RR condition relative to the other conditions. Although participants were signiﬁcantly slower to respond correctly during the early versus late trials across conditions, the effect was not any greater for the RR condition. As a consequence, this potential interpretation concerning the impact of dlPFC activity on contingency learning remains speculative pending additional empirical consideration.  Finally, in the context of reversal learning, the amygdala is thought to represent the learned incentive value of a reward and bias behaviour accordingly (Elliott et al., 2004; Izquierdo and Murray, 2007; Rudebeck and Murray, 2008). In line with this, an electrophysiology experiment involving rhesus monkeys revealed that cellular activity within the amygdala following stimulus-reward contingency change predicted subsequent behavioural change (Paton et al., 2006). Furthermore, Blair and colleagues (Budhani et al., 2007) observed enhanced amygdala activity to correct-feedback during reversal learning in a recent neuroimaging study. In line with these results, we observed enhanced amygdala activity during the early stages of relearning when reinforcement contingencies changed. This effect of reinforcement change was not modulated by whether the decision  1440  S.G. Greening et al. / NeuroImage 54 (2011) 1432–1441  involved having the participant perform a classic reversal, overcome avoidance, or inhibit a response to a previously rewarding stimulus.  Conclusions  Although it has been recently demonstrated that two key subprocesses of reversal learning (response inhibition and overcoming avoidance) are dissociable on a neurochemical level in marmosets, locus of the effect within prefrontal cortex, the precise neural In the current study, particularly in humans, remained unclear. previously confounded processes within reversal learning were distinguished. Relative to response inhibition trials, overcoming avoidance differentially recruited areas of mOFC and superior–lateral frontal pole. In addition anterior dmPFC and angular gyrus showed greater error-feedback related activity during overcoming avoidance relative to response inhibition trials. The striking overlap in activity within IFG during both overcoming avoidance and response inhibition does not support functional conceptualizations of this region that speciﬁcally emphasize motor response inhibition. Instead, the results support theoretical formulations that argue for a role of IFG in modulating the competitive weights of available response options to facilitate optimal choice behaviour. Lastly, we observed activity in dlPFC that was highest during the early stages of correct classic reversal learning, and least during later trials of this condition. On the basis of these and previous data (Mitchell et al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 2008),we propose a supportive role for dlPFC in enhanced contingency learning, perhaps by way of an attentional mechanism that augments the representation of stimuli and stimulus-reinforcement information. This attentional mechanism would result in enhanced learning and greater ease of decision making (i.e., reduced decision conﬂict) during later trials — a contribution that may prove more crucial in complex decision making tasks.  Future work fractionating reversal learning processes in humans with neuroimaging have important implications for models of prefrontal function, and for the range of psychiatric disorders associated with reversal learning deﬁcits, from major depression (Murphy et al., 2003) and bipolar disorder (Dickstein et al., 2009), to psychopathy (Mitchell et al., 2002). The current fMRI study was guided by prior neurochemical work performed in marmosets (Clarke et al., 2007). Further work that is informed by neuropharmacological (e.g., Chamberlain et al., 2006; Clarke et al., 2004, 2005; Dodds et al., 2008; Rogers et al., 2003) and genetic approaches (Finger et al., 2007; Hariri et al., 2005) may be particularly promising for the development and evaluation of therapeutic interventions for a host of behavioural and emotional abnormalities that feature similar, though as yet underspeciﬁed, decision making deﬁcits.

Two case reports of late-stage AD showed that this loss of self-face recognition was temporally graded: photographs from the remote past were recognized more easily than more recent photographs. Little is known about the neural correlates of own face recognition abilities in AD patients, while neuroimaging studies in healthy adults have related these abilities to a bilateral fronto-parieto-occipital network. In this study, two behavioral experiments (experiments 1 and 2) and one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment (second part of experiment 2) were conducted to compare mild AD patients (experiment 1) and moderate AD patients (experiment 2) with healthy older participants in a recognition task involving self and familiar faces from different decades of the participants' life. In moderate AD patients, variable performance allowed us to examine correlations between scores and resting-state fMRI in order to link behavioral data to cerebral activity. At the behavioral level, the results revealed that, in mild AD, self and familiar face recognition was preserved. Moreover, mild AD patients and healthy older participants showed an inverse temporal gradient, with faster recognition of self and familiar recent photographs than self and familiar remote photographs. However, in moderate AD, both self and familiar face recognition were affected. fMRI results showed that the higher the connectivity between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and the right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG), the lower the self and familiar face recognition scores in moderate AD patients. Given that previous studies have related the superior frontal region to control processes rather than face recognition processes, these results might reﬂect less segregation and more interference between brain networks in AD. In other words, impaired face recognition in AD may be related to functional dedifferentiation of speciﬁc brain regions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.  * Corresponding author.

Introduction  Episodic memory deﬁcits are early signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the disease progresses, semantic memory decline also appears. These deﬁcits are strongly related with problems affecting activities of daily living (Perry & Hodges, 2000), including face recognition. For example, substantial impairments in the identiﬁcation and naming of famous faces have been observed even early in the course of the disease (e.g., Greene & Hodges, 1996; Hodges & Greene, 1998). At later stages of the disease, these difﬁculties seem to extend to aspects of perceptual self-knowledge such as self-face recognition (e.g., Biringer & Anderson, 1992; Hehman, German, & Klein, 2005). To investigate self-face recognition in AD patients, some authors have used mirror recognition techniques (e.g., Biringer & Anderson, 1992; Bologna & Camp, 1995, 1997; Grewal, 1994), while others used recognition of one's own face from photographs. Fazio and Mitchell (2009) reported that participants in mild to moderate stages of AD were able to identify their own picture among a group of ﬁve photographs. However, three patients in the moderate stage (3/26 ¼ 12%) could not tell who was in the picture when it was presented alone. Another study reported that a majority of patients in the moderate to severe stages of AD (6/9 ¼ 67%) were still able to recognize their own photographs among fellow residents' photographs (Gross et al., 2004). However, they were unable to point at photographs of other residents when they were given their names. In severe stages of AD, difﬁculties with self-face recognition affect even more patients (Biringer & Anderson, 1992). Indeed, only 7 out of 29 participants (24%) in Biringer and Anderson's study were able to recognize themselves and a familiar person in a video. Moreover, among the 22 participants who were unable to recognize themselves, seven were also unable to recognize the familiar person. Together, these studies suggest that selfface recognition is preserved in the mild stages of AD but, for more advanced stages, this ability decreases and more patients manifest a deﬁcit.  However, these previous studies suffer from some methodological limitations. For example, in the study by Fazio and Mitchell (2009), the photographs were taken only a few minutes before the test. Although the authors noted that none of the participants mentioned remembering the photographs, the context could have played a role during recognition. Some of the participants' comments about the clothes worn in the pictures seem to suggest this possibility. In addition, there was no control condition involving a familiar face, so it cannot be ruled out that the performance obtained for self faces is due to their familiarity and not to their self-relevance. Although this control condition was included in the study by Gross et al. (2004), the familiar persons were fellow residents, and thus persons who the participants had certainly met after the onset of the disease. As anterograde memory and face-name association learning are impaired even in the earliest stages of AD (Irish, Lawlor, Coen, & O'Mara, 2011), the inability to recognize fellow residents' faces based on their names is not surprising. Consequently, one aim of the present study was to examine self- and familiar-face recognition in persons with AD using a well-controlled methodology.  There is some evidence suggesting that semantic memory loss is temporally graded in early AD (e.g., Greene & Hodges, 1996; Hodges, Salmon, & Butters, 1993; Westmacott, Freedman, Black, Stokes, & Moscovitch, 2004): knowledge from the remote past is relatively better preserved than more recently acquired knowledge. Moreover, this temporal gradient also seems to be present in self-face recognition. Hehman et al. (2005) reported the case of a woman in the late stages of AD who was unable to recognize herself in recent photographs but who had no difﬁculty recognizing her face in photographs taken during the ﬁrst two decades of her adult life. Similarly, EF, a woman with late-stage AD, was unable to recognize herself in the mirror but she could recognize herself from photographs, with greater ease for old photographs (Phillips, Howard, & David, 1996). These two case studies indicate that the difﬁculties with self-face recognition observed in severe AD seem to affect mainly the recognition of recent photographs. The patients' perceptual representations of their own faces may be outdated because of a lack of information updating. However, the descriptions found in just two case studies might be seen as anecdotal. So, the second aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of temporally graded loss of self-face knowledge in a large sample of patients.  Currently, it is not known how changes to self-recognition in AD relate to cerebral changes. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, only one study to date has investigated the neural correlates of personally familiar faces in AD (Donix et al., 2013) and none has examined the neural correlates of self-face recognition in this population. Thus, the third aim of the present study was to investigate the link between self- and familiar-face recognition and cerebral activity, by using resting-state fMRI in moderate AD patients.  In healthy subjects, studies have shown that different cerebral regions are activated depending on the type of face (self, familiar, or unknown) to be recognized. Gobbini and Haxby (2007) proposed a revised model of the neural systems for face perception with an emphasis on processes associated with the recognition of personally familiar faces (family members and friends). In their model, a core system composed of the inferior occipital and fusiform gyri and the superior temporal sulcus is responsible for encoding the visual appearance of a familiar face. Recognition of familiar faces also involves areas whose primary functions relate to knowledge of persons and emotions (Gobbini & Haxby, 2007). Theory of mind areas such as the posterior temporal sulcus/ temporo-parietal junction and anterior paracingulate cortex contribute to the retrieval of the personality traits, intentions, attitudes and mental states of familiar persons, whereas activation in the anterior insula and amygdala may be linked to the emotional response when seeing a familiar face. Finally, activation of the anterior temporal cortex probably reﬂects its role in the retrieval of biographical or autobiographical information (D'Argembeau et al., 2005), while the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) are involved in the retrieval of episodic memories and familiarity processing (Donix et al., 2010).  Activations in most regions described for personally familiar faces are also observed for the self face, but neuroimaging studies suggest that one's own face is processed differently and elicits additional activation during recognition  c o r t e x 6 7 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 5 9 e7 3  61  compared to recognition of others' faces (Devue & Bredart, 2011; Platek, Wathne, Tierney, & Thomson, 2008). When selfrecognition is contrasted to recognition of faces varying in familiarity, a mainly right-lateralized network including mostly frontal and parietal regions is found to be associated with self-face recognition (for recent reviews, see Devue & Bredart, 2011; Platek et al., 2008). Within the prefrontal cortex, which may be a necessary substrate to engage in selfprocessing (Fossati et al., 2003; Uddin, Kaplan, MolnarSzakacs, Zaidel, & Iacoboni, 2005), activation in the inferior frontal gyrus has been reported in most studies contrasting the recognition of self faces to familiar faces, either on the right side, the left side or bilaterally. Activation in this region (Devue et al., 2007; Platek et al., 2008; Uddin et al., 2005) and in the middle and medial frontal regions is thought to be involved in more complex forms of discrimination between the self and others (Devue et al., 2007; Platek & Kemp, 2009). Activations of the inferior parietal lobule and the supramarginal gyrus have been reported and could be linked to the representation of the self face as part of one's own body (Platek et al., 2008); thus, they may be implicated in spatial representation of oneself (Devue & Bredart, 2011). During selfrecognition, direct connections between parietal and frontal cortices exist and, according to Uddin, Iacoboni, Lange, and Keenan (2007), this network overlaps with regions containing mirror neurons, in which the self-related information is processed using a network that compares the self to others. Finally, the precuneus is activated during recognition of the self face (Devue & Bredart, 2011; Platek et al., 2008) but also the partner's face (Taylor et al., 2009). Like other regions belonging to the cortical midline structures, and particularly the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) (D'Argembeau et al., 2005) and the anterior part of the cingulate gyrus (Northoff & Bermpohl, 2004), the precuneus is involved in integrative processing of information related to the self.  thoughts  It is notable that brain regions related to the recognition of one's own or a familiar face overlap with regions of some resting-state networks, especially the default mode network (DMN). Indeed e and this is relevant to self-face recognition e the DMN has been linked to self-related and internal processes, such as monitoring of the mental self (Lou et al., 2004), (McKiernan, D'Angelo, stimulus-independent Kaufman, & Binder, 2006), episodic and autobiographical memory (Buckner et al., 2005), mind-wandering (Mason et al., 2007), and social cognition (Schilbach, Eickhoff, RotarskaJagiela, Fink, & Vogeley, 2008). This network encompasses the MPFC, posterior cingulate cortex/retrosplenial cortex (PCC/RSP), inferior parietal lobule, lateral temporal cortex, and formation (Buckner, Andrews-Hanna, & hippocampal Schacter, 2008). The main hubs of the DMN are within the MPFC and along the posterior midline structures including the PCC (Brewer, Garrison, & Whitﬁrld-Gabrieli, 2013; D'Argembeau et al., 2005; Gusnard, Akbudak, Shulman, & Raichle, 2001; Johnson et al., 2002). More speciﬁcally, the ventral part of the MPFC seems to be activated when participants make selfreferential judgments and engage in other forms of selfrelevant exploration (D'Argembeau et al., 2005; Northoff & Bermpohl, 2004). The role of this region is thought to represent stable (semantic) knowledge with a degree of valence in relation to the self (own personality traits or attitudes).  The dorsal MPFC may represent or evaluate current states of the self and others and may represent current and more transient states of both the self and others with a degree of certainty (Frith & Frith, 2003; Gusnard & Raichle, 2001).  Previous studies of AD patients reported disruption in the DMN. In addition to an often-reported hypometabolism in some brain regions overlapping with DMN areas, particularly the posterior ones (Buckner et al., 2005), and the fact that pathology tends to accumulate in areas of the DMN even before the appearance of clinical symptoms (Klunk et al., 2004), some studies have reported functional disruptions, illustrated by a lack of deactivation of this network during a task (Lustig et al., 2003) and reduced intra-network functional connectivity (Agosta et al., 2012; Brier et al. 2012; Greicius, Srivastava, Reiss, & Menon, 2004; Rombouts, Barkhof, Goekoop, Stam, & Scheltens, 2005; Wang et al., 2007).  The only study that investigated the neural correlates of face recognition in AD reported reduced activity in bilateral superior frontal and right middle orbital areas associated with the perception of personally familiar faces (Donix et al., 2013), a result that the authors interpreted as a failure in monitoring self-associated consequences in a social context. Considering that self- and familiar-face recognition is altered in AD, and that the DMN is disrupted in this pathology, and given the importance of these brain areas for self-related processing, familiarity, and social cognition more generally, we hypothesized that there should be a relationship between the DMN and self- and familiar-face recognition abilities in AD patients. Thus, in the present study, two behavioral experiments (experiments 1 and 2) and one fMRI experiment (second part of experiment 2) were conducted to compare mild AD patients (experiment 1) and moderate AD patients (experiment 2) with healthy older participants in a recognition task involving self and familiar faces from different decades of the participants' life. In the moderate AD patients, variability in their performance allowed us to examine the neural correlates of face recognition by means of resting-state fMRI. These experiments allowed us to evaluate (1) whether self- and familiarface recognition is compromised in AD; (2) whether the pattern of performance differs as a function of disease severity; (3) whether a temporally graded loss of self-face recognition exists; and (4) whether the capacity to recognize one's own face or a highly familiar face is related to the functional connectivity of the DMN.  2.  Experiment 1  Previous studies had reported no difﬁculty with self-face recognition in mild AD patients (Fazio & Mitchell, 2009). However, because of the above-mentioned methodological limitations of earlier work, we re-examined this issue with a well-controlled methodology. Additionally, given that recognition accuracy may show a ceiling effect, reaction times were used as a more sensitive index of recognition capacities, considering that longer reaction times would signal greater difﬁculty in recognizing faces.  This experiment also examined whether there is a temporal gradient in self-face recognition in mild AD patients, as has been observed in the severe stages of AD (Hehman et al.,  62  c o r t e x 6 7 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 5 9 e7 3  2005; Phillips et al., 1996). Given that semantic memory loss is temporally graded even in early AD, this might also extend to aspects of perceptual self-knowledge. If these patients already had minor updating impairments of the self-face representation, then their reaction times should be longer for recent photographs than for photographs from the more remote past. Moreover, it may be that this temporal gradient is not speciﬁc to self faces but is also present in familiar-face recognition.  Finally, the last objective of this experiment was to examine healthy older adults' performance. The majority of self-face recognition studies have focused on the performance of young adults (e.g., Keenan et al., 1999; Keyes & Brady, 2010). They reported that young adults processed their own faces faster than other familiar faces. Moreover, the recognition of familiar faces was faster than the recognition of strangers' faces. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined self-face recognition in older adults. We therefore investigated whether older adults would have the same pattern of results in self-face recognition as young adults. If so, they should be faster at recognizing their own faces than familiar faces, and faster at recognizing familiar faces than unknown ones.  2.1.  Method  Participants  2.1.1. Twenty-one patients (6 women) diagnosed with probable AD according to the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association criteria (McKhann et al., 2011) participated in this study. Patients were referred by neurologists working at the Memory Clinic of the University Hospital of Liege (Belgium). Diagnosis was based on a clinical interview with the patient and a caregiver and on general neurological and neuropsychological examinations. Hippocampal atrophy detected on a structural magnetic resonance image was taken as biomarker. Patients were in the mild stage of the disease, as indicated by a Mini Mental State (MMSE) score above 20 (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975).  Twenty-one healthy older controls were recruited from seniors' organizations and among acquaintances of the experimenters' relatives and friends. The healthy controls had no history of neurological or psychiatric impairment. They were selected to match AD patients according to their age [t(40) ¼  .14, p ¼ .89], number of years of education [t(40) ¼  .44, p ¼ .66] and gender. The AD patients had lower than their matched controls scores on the MMSE [t(40) ¼  6.44, p < .01]. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Liege and each participant (and a close relative for probable AD patients) gave informed consent to participate in the study in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. The demographic characteristics of the AD and control groups are presented in Table 1.  Procedure and materials  2.1.2. 2.1.2.1. SELF-FACE RECOGNITION  2.1.2.1.1. STIMULI. Each participant was presented with a total of 30 photographs including 10 self, 10 familiar (spouse) and 10 unknown faces from four life periods: 20e30 years, 35e45 years, 50e60 years and 65 years and over. All participants already knew their spouses at the time these photographs were taken. There were two photographs from each  Table 1 e Demographic characteristics of AD and control groups.

The unknown faces included equal numbers of females and males in each life period. Photographs were obtained digitally (JPEGs) or by scanner. Each photograph was manipulated in Gimp 2.8.4. Context and clothing in the head and neck area were neutralized. Faces were seen from a frontal view as much as possible. Each photograph was resized to 149  223 pixels and converted to grayscale and BMP format. Some examples of pictures are presented in Fig. 1.  2.1.2.1.2. PROCEDURE. Participants were tested individually at their homes or in a lab at the Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Liege, Belgium. Faces were presented on a computer in pseudo-random order using E-prime 1. Two self faces or two familiar faces could not appear consecutively. The screen was placed at a viewing distance of 60 cm. Each trial started with a ﬁxation cross that appeared for 1000 ms followed by the face to be evaluated, which remained on screen until the participant responded. The 30 photographs were presented twice without a break between the two presentation blocks. Participants were informed that they were going to see their own, familiar and unknown faces belonging to different life periods. They were instructed to press one of three keys to indicate which of the three face types (self, familiar, or unfamiliar) was presented. They were told that the accuracy of their response as well as their reaction times were being recorded so that they were aware that they needed to complete the task as quickly as possible but make the fewest possible errors.  Before the experiment started, participants engaged in a practice session involving 12 faces (3 self, 3 familiar and 6 unknown) that were different from the ones used in the experimental task. This session allowed participants to familiarize themselves with the experiment. In order to verify that they had understood the instructions, participants were asked to give their responses orally as well, so we could verify their consistency with the button press responses. All participants understood the instructions and pressed the correct buttons.  2.1.2.2. UNFAMILIAR FACE PROCESSING. After the face recognition task, the more general ability to process unfamiliar faces was assessed with the short form of the Benton Facial Recognition Test (Benton, Hamsher, Varney, & Spreen, 1983). This test consists of 13 items in which a target face is presented and participants are requested to match it to one face or several faces within an array of six photographs. Three matching  c o r t e x 6 7 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 5 9 e7 3  63  Fig. 1 e Sample photographs of a participant taken across four age periods of her life.  conditions are presented: photographs may be identical frontal-view faces or they may be taken from different angles or under different lighting conditions. Scores were converted into long-form scores according to Benton et al.'s (1983) table; the maximum possible score was 54.  because of one patient that is particularly poor in familiar face recognition (55% of correct responses vs 90% and more for all other patients). Without this patient, no signiﬁcant difference between the two groups was revealed for familiar face recognition (see Fig. 2).  2.1.2.3. STATISTICAL PROCEDURES. Two scores were collected for each participant: (a) the percentage of correct responses; and (b) the median reaction time for correct responses (median reaction times (RTs) were preferred over mean RTs because they are not inﬂuenced by extreme values).  For each dependent variable, two analyses were carried out. First, we considered the effects of the faces' identity regardless of life period. A mixed design was used, with one between-participants factor (Group, two levels: mild-AD and control) and one within-participants factor (Identity of faces, three levels: self, familiar and unknown). Next, we considered the effects of life period for self and familiar faces. Unknown faces were excluded from this analysis because the impact of life period was irrelevant for this category of faces. A mixed design was used, with one between-participants factor (Group, two levels: mild-AD and control) and two within-participants factors (Identity of faces, two levels: self and familiar; Age of faces, four levels: 20e30, 35e45, 50e60 and 65 and above).  Because several conditions of application of parametric analysis of variance (ANOVAs) were not respected (i.e., normality of the distribution, the homogeneity of variances and the sphericity), non-parametric analyses were carried out on the percentage of correct responses. KruskaleWallis tests and ManneWhitney tests were used for the inter-group comparisons. Friedman tests and Wilcoxon tests were used for the intra-group comparisons. Post-hoc tests were interpreted using the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.  2.2.  Results  Self-face recognition task  2.2.1. 2.2.1.1. ACCURACY. As expected, performance was close to ceiling level in both groups. Therefore, we will not describe these analyses in detail. Note that ManneWhitney tests revealed a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups for familiar face recognition, U ¼ 140, zadj ¼  2.41, padj ¼ .016. AD patients recognized familiar faces less accurately than their matched controls did. However, this difference is signiﬁcant  2.2.1.2. REACTION TIMES  2.2.1.2.1. IDENTITY OF FACES. A 2 (Group)  3 (Identity of faces) ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor was carried out on reaction times. The analysis revealed a signiﬁcant main effect of Group, F(1,39) ¼ 11.38, p ¼ .001, p ¼ .23. Reaction times were longer in AD patients h2 (M ¼ 1446.51, SD ¼ 544.64) than in the control group (M ¼ 1061.59, SD ¼ 330.76). Moreover, a signiﬁcant main effect p ¼ .12. of Identity of faces was found, F(2,78) ¼ 5.60, p ¼ .005, h2 Planned comparisons showed that all participants identiﬁed unknown faces (M ¼ 1379.74, SD ¼ 676.30) more slowly than both self-faces (M ¼ 11178.28, SD ¼ 301.84) and familiar faces (M ¼ 1190.05, SD ¼ 382.39). Finally, this ANOVA revealed no signiﬁcant interaction between the two factors, F(2,78) ¼ 1.01, p ¼ .37 (see Fig. 3).  2.2.1.2.2. AGE OF FACES.

Moreover, Spearman's correlation between performance on the Benton Facial Recognition Test and MMSE score was not signiﬁcant in the AD group (rs ¼ .27, p ¼ .24).  2.3.  Discussion  As expected, self- and familiar-face recognition performance, as measured by percentage of correct responses, showed a ceiling effect, with means higher than 90% for both groups. Although one patient had a particularly poor performance in familiar face recognition, this experiment revealed, in general, a preservation of self- and familiar face recognition in mild AD patients. These ﬁndings are consistent with Fazio and Mitchell (2009) study that reported also no problem with self-face recognition in the mild stages of AD. However, mild AD patients were slower than controls for all faces recognition.  Regarding the occurrence of a temporal gradient in selfface recognition, the measurement of accuracy percentages revealed no difference according to the age of the faces in the photographs. However, this absence of difference could be due to the ceiling effect. Indeed, reaction time results showed that AD patients were faster at recognizing recent photographs of themselves and familiar people than photographs from more remote periods. So it appears that the temporal gradient is actually opposite to our expectation. However, this temporal gradient is also observed in healthy older adults. Two hypotheses could explain this result. First, faces from the remote past might cause a “surprise” reaction that increases the time needed to respond. A second possibility is that access to one's own or familiar faces from the remote past might be more difﬁcult for seniors than access to such faces from the recent past; this decreased accessibility might increase reaction times. Indeed, older couples, particularly if they are both retired, spend most of their time together (unless as in other decades of life) and therefore, self and familiar faces from the recent past could be more easily processed.  Young adults are better at self-face recognition than familiar-face and unknown-face recognition (Keenan et al., 1999; Keyes & Brady, 2010). In this experiment, AD patients and their healthy older adults were faster at recognizing self and familiar faces than unknown faces. However, their performance did not differ according to the familiarity of faces. This absence of superiority of self-face recognition in comparison with familiar face recognition could be explained by the fact that the familiar faces used in this experiment were their spouses' faces. All participants had known their spouses since their youth. Over time, spouses' faces may become as relevant as self faces. Future studies that directly compare young and older adults at self-face recognition are necessary to ﬁnd out whether this result is speciﬁc to older adults or is an artifact linked to the use of faces from different life periods.  3.  Experiment 2  In this experiment, self-face recognition was examined in the moderate stages of AD. Previous studies had reported that difﬁculties with self-face recognition were infrequent in moderate AD (Fazio & Mitchell, 2009; Gross et al., 2004).  Fig. 3 e Mean reaction time according to identity of faces and group. Error bars represent SEM.  factors was carried out on reaction times. The analysis revealed a signiﬁcant main effect of Group, F(1,39) ¼ 11.28, p ¼ .22. In addition, a signiﬁcant main effect of Age p ¼ .002, h2 p ¼ .16. Planned of faces was found, F(3,117) ¼ 7.30, p < .001, h2 comparisons showed that all participants recognized recent photographs faster than photos taken at other ages. They also recognized photographs of faces aged 50e60 years faster than photographs taken at 35e45 years and 20e30 years (see Fig. 4). Finally, the interaction between Identity of faces and Age of faces was marginally signiﬁcant, F(3,117) ¼ 2.57, p ¼ .058. Planned comparisons showed that participants were faster at recognizing familiar faces aged 20e30 years than their own faces aged 20e30 years. Moreover, the main effect of Age of faces was observed chieﬂy (and unexpectedly) in the recognition of self faces. For familiar faces, reaction times were faster for recent photographs than for photographs taken at 20e30 years and 35e45 years. However, no main effect of Identity of faces was found, F(1,39) ¼ .11, p ¼ .74. Finally, this ANOVA revealed no signiﬁfaces and Group, cant F(1,39) ¼ .15, p ¼ .70, between Age of faces and Group, F(3,117) ¼ 1.95, p ¼ .12 and between Identity of faces, Age of faces and Group, F(3,117) ¼ .77, p ¼ .51.  interaction between Identity of  Benton Facial Recognition Test  2.2.2. An independent sample t-test was carried out on the Benton test scores. The analysis revealed no signiﬁcant difference  Fig. 4 e Mean reaction time according to age of faces and group. Error bars represent SEM.  c o r t e x 6 7 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 5 9 e7 3  65  However, some methodological limitations applied, as noted in section 1. Therefore, we would expect poorer self-face recognition performance in moderate AD patients than in matched controls. Moreover, previous studies (Hehman et al., 2005; Phillips et al., 1996) showed a temporally graded loss of self-face recognition in severe AD patients. Therefore, we would expect less accurate recognition of recent selfphotographs than of remote self-photographs in the moderate stages of AD.  In addition, to examine the neural correlates of face recognition in AD, resting-state fMRI was acquired in the moderate AD group. More speciﬁcally, we tested the correlation between the functional connectivity of key regions of the DMN [dorsal MPFC (dMPFC) and PCC], as assessed with resting-state fMRI, and face recognition scores (either familiar, self, or recent self faces) in AD patients. Considering that, in previous studies (Ries et al., 2012), attenuated functional connectivity between DMN regions was associated with less accurate self-appraisal scores in AD patients, our hypothesis was that a higher level of connectivity between DMN seed regions (dMPFC, PCC) and other DMN regions (intranetwork connectivity) would be associated with better selfand familiar-face recognition scores. Alternatively, higher connectivity levels between the DMN seeds and regions belonging to other resting-state networks (inter-network connectivity) might be linked to worse recognition scores, as AD patients have been shown to lose network segregation (Brier et al., 2012) and may be less efﬁcient at recruiting the appropriate networks.  Previous studies of aging had shown that upregulated activity in the prefrontal cortices was associated with poorer performance in word-retrieval tasks (Meinzer, Lindenberg, Antonenko, Flaisch, & Fl€oel, 2013) or language processing (Antonenko, Meinzer, Lindenberg, Witte, & Fl€oel, 2012). For the sake of completeness, we also analyzed connectivity in the occipito-temporal (ventral) pathway, which is involved in face processing per se, but we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant correlation with self and spouse face processing in our AD population, so this will not be reported in the results section.  3.1.  Method  Participants  3.1.1. Patients and healthy older controls were recruited with the same criteria as in experiment 1. Twenty-ﬁve patients (15 women) in the moderate stage of AD, as indicated by an MMSE score between 10 and 21 (Folstein et al., 1975), participated in this study. Twenty-ﬁve healthy older controls (15 women) were selected to match the AD patients according to their age [t(48) ¼ 1.07, p ¼ .29], number of years of education [t(48) ¼  1.42, p ¼ .16] and gender. The AD patients had lower MMSE scores than the matched controls [t(48) ¼  22.77, p < .01]. Moreover, MMSE scores of AD patients in this experiment was lower than those of AD patients in experiment 1 [t(44) ¼ 13.17, p < .01]. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Liege and each participant (and a close relative for AD patients) gave informed consent to participate in the study in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. The demographic characteristics of the AD and control groups are presented in Table 2.  Table 2 e Demographic characteristics of AD and control groups. Standard deviations are presented within parentheses.

SELF-FACE RECOGNITION. This task was the same as in experiment 1 except that no reaction times were recorded. Indeed, AD patients found it difﬁcult to press buttons to provide their answers and a time pressure was likely to induce errors due to a mix-up of buttons, so oral responses were preferred. Therefore, participants responded orally at their own pace and the experimenter pressed the appropriate response button.  3.1.2.2. UNFAMILIAR FACE PROCESSING. As in experiment 1, after the face recognition task was done, unfamiliar face processing was assessed with the short form of the Benton Facial Recognition Test (Benton et al., 1983).  3.1.2.3. IMAGING PROCEDURE. Twenty out of the 25 AD patients also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session. Two patients refused to take part in an MRI session, one patient's clinical condition (metal devices) was not compatible with MRI and two subjects were discarded because of movement artifacts. Structural and resting-state fMRI data were therefore available for 20 AD patients (13 women, mean age¼ 74.9 ± 5.4; years of education¼ 10.25 ± 4.49). The AD group in the MRI analysis did not differ from the AD cohort as a whole on measures listed in Table 3 (p > .40 for all comparisons).  All imaging data were collected on a 3-Tesla head-only Siemens Allegra scanner (Siemens, Allegra, Erlangen, Germany) with the standard transmit-receive quadrature head coil. T2*-weighted functional images were acquired using a gradient-echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with repetition time (TR) ¼ 2040 ms, echo time (TE) ¼ 30 ms, ﬂip angle ¼ 90  , ﬁeld of view (FoV) ¼ 192  192 mm2, matrix size ¼ 64  64, voxel size ¼ 3  3  3 mm3. Thirty-four 3-mm thick transverse slices were acquired, with an interslice gap of 25%,  Table 3 e Comparison between AD group in the MRI analysis and entire AD cohort on age, years of education and three behavioral measures (% of accuracy) used in MRI analysis.

During the resting-state acquisition (250 volumes, approximately 8 min), participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed and remain awake. The ﬁrst three volumes were discarded from analyses to allow for magnetization equilibrium. Gradient-recalled sequences were applied directly after the functional sequences to acquire two complex images with different echo times (TE ¼ 4.92 and 7.38 ms respectively) and generate ﬁeld maps for distortion correction of the EPI images. A high-resolution T1-weighted image was acquired for each participant with the T1weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence with TE ¼ 4.35 ms, TR ¼ 1960 ms, TI ¼ 1100 ms, ﬁeld of view ¼ 230  173 mm2, resolution ¼ 256  192  176, voxel size ¼ .9  .9  .9 mm3. Head movement was minimized by restraining the subject's head using foam pads.  3.1.2.4. IMAGE ANALYSIS  3.1.2.4.1. PREPROCESSING. Imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, http//www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) implemented in MATLAB 7.12 (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA). For each subject, EPI time series were corrected for motion and distortion using Realign and Unwarp (Andersson, Hutton, Ashburner, Turner, & Friston, 2001) together with the FieldMap toolbox (Hutton et al., 2002) in SPM8. Functional scans were realigned using rigid body transformations, iteratively optimized to minimize the residual sum of squares between the ﬁrst and each subsequent image separately and a mean realigned functional image was then calculated by averaging all the realigned functional scans. This mean functional image was coregistered to the structural T1-image using a rigid body transformation optimized to maximize the normalized mutual information between the two images. The resulting coregistration parameters were then applied to the realigned functional images. The mapping from subject to Montreal neurologic institute (MNI) space was estimated from the structural image using the “uniﬁed segmentation” approach (Ashburner & Friston, 2005). The warping parameters were then separately applied to the functional and structural images to produce normalized images with resolutions of 2  2  2 mm3 and 1  1  1 mm3, respectively. Finally, the warped functional images were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM). Artifact reduction software (ART; http://www.nitrc. org/projects/artifact_detect) was also used to account for motion artifact. Outliers in the global mean signal intensity and motion were subsequently included as nuisance parameters during the functional analysis.  3.1.2.4.2. FUNCTIONAL ANALYSES. Group functional connectivity maps in AD patients were created using the NetBrainWork toolbox (http://sites.google.com/site.netbrainwork). As implemented in the toolbox, functional networks were detected at the group level using NEDICA (Network Detection using independent component analysis (ICA); Perlbarg et al., 2008), which consists in detecting the functional networks at the individual level using spatial independent component analysis and then checking their reproducibility across subjects to provide a consistent map across subjects. In order to perform seedto-voxel analyses, regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen from  the literature on AD patients (Brier et al., 2012). These ROIs were chosen based on their involvement in the DMN and their identiﬁcation in the literature as critical regions for self- and familiar-face recognition. Two seed regions (a sphere with a radius of 8 mm around the coordinates) were selected: the dMPFC (MNI: 0, 61, 22) and the PCC (MNI: 0, e51, 29). We ensured with a visual inspection that the ROIs found in the literature overlapped with regions of the DMN map identiﬁed by NEDICA. Seed-to-voxel analyses were performed to measure the connectivity between seed regions and all brain voxels using the fMRI functional connectivity toolbox Conn (http://www.nitric. org/projects/conn). The resulting connectivity maps were entered into correlation analyses in SPM8: the independent variable was connectivity maps, and behavioral recognition scores were entered as covariate of interest. Three correlation analyses were performed with three different recognition scores: recognition of self face (independently of the life period), recognition of self face for the most recent period, and recognition of the familiar face (independently of the life period).  3.1.2.5. STATISTICAL PROCEDURES. Given that reaction times were not recorded, in this experiment, the dependent measure was only the percentage of correct responses. As in the experiment 1, we ﬁrst considered the effects of the faces' identity regardless of life period. A mixed design was used, with one betweenparticipants factor (Group, two levels: moderate-AD and control) and one within-participants factor (Identity of faces, three levels: self, familiar and unknown). Next, we considered the effects of life period for self and familiar faces. Unknown faces were excluded from this analysis because the impact of life period was irrelevant for this category of faces. A mixed design was used, with one between-participants factor (Group, two levels: moderate-AD and control) and two within-participants factors (Identity of faces, two levels: self and familiar; Age of faces, four levels: 20e30, 35e45, 50e60 and 65 and above).  Because several conditions of application of parametric ANOVAs were not respected (i.e., normality of the distribution, the homogeneity of variances and the sphericity), nonparametric analyses were carried out on the percentage of correct responses. KruskaleWallis tests and ManneWhitney tests were used for the inter-group comparisons. Friedman tests and Wilcoxon tests were used for the intra-group comparisons. Post-hoc tests were interpreted using the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.  Finally, we examined the relationship between self-face and familiar face recognition in calculating Spearman's correlation between self-face recognition and familiar-face recognition in the AD and control groups.  3.2.

For ManneWhitney tests, a Bonferroni correction was applied on the statistical signiﬁcance level; p < .017 was considered as signiﬁcant. Fig. 5 shows the accuracy percentages for AD patients and their matched controls according to the identity of the faces.  ManneWhitney tests were used to compare the two groups' performance based on the identity of faces. AD patients  c o r t e x 6 7 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 5 9 e7 3  67  familiar-face recognition was signiﬁcant for the AD group (rs ¼ .58, p < .01), but not the control group (rs ¼ .20, p ¼ .34).  Benton Facial Recognition Test  3.2.2. An independent samples t-test was carried out on the Benton test scores. The analysis revealed a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups, t(48) ¼  5.27, p < .001. AD patients (M ¼ 42.24, SD ¼ 6.36) were less accurate at face processing than controls (M ¼ 49.52, SD ¼ 2.69). Moreover, Spearman's correlation between performance on the Benton Facial Recognition Test and MMSE score was signiﬁcant in the AD group (rs ¼ .48, p ¼ .01).  3.2.3. Correlations To assess whether the AD group's poorer face recognition was related to dementia severity, Spearman's correlations were calculated in the AD group between self-face and familiar-face recognition performance on the one hand and MMSE scores on the other hand. None of these correlations were signiﬁcant; details are presented in Table 6.  To assess whether the AD group's poorer face recognition was related to poorer face processing, Spearman's correlations were computed between self-face and familiar-face recognition performance and the Benton facial recognition score. As shown in Table 6, self-face recognition was signiﬁcantly correlated with the Benton facial recognition score, indicating poorer self-face recognition in participants with poorer face processing. However, no signiﬁcant correlation was found between familiar-face recognition and face processing.  fMRI results  3.2.4. The cluster's level of statistical signiﬁcance was set at a familywise-error-corrected p-value of < .05. SPM analyses revealed signiﬁcant negative correlations between the connectivity level of the dMPFC seed and a region in the right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG) on the one hand, and the behavioral self-face recognition score (rSFG; cluster size: 261, Z-value ¼ 5.08; 4.25, p-corrected value ¼ .002), the recent selfface recognition score (rSFG; cluster size: 151, Z-value ¼ 4.22; 3.51, p-corrected value ¼ .037), and the familiar face recognition score (rSFG; cluster size: 277, Z-value ¼ 5.44, p-corrected value ¼ .002) on the other hand. To check whether the negative correlation between self- and familiar-face recognition and cerebral connectivity is driven by dementia severity, the MMSE score was introduced as a covariate. We again found a signiﬁcant negative correlation between the dMPFC seed and rSFG connectivity level and the self-face recognition score (rSFG; cluster size: 235, Z-value ¼ 4.79; 4.08, p-corrected value ¼ .004), and the familiar-face recognition score (rSFG;  Fig. 5 e Accuracy percentages for moderate AD patients and matched controls according to identity of faces.

However, no signiﬁcant difference was found between the two groups for unknown face recognition, U ¼ 276, zadj ¼  1.16, padj ¼ .25. Friedman tests revealed no effect of the identity of faces in the control group, c2 (2) ¼ .5, p ¼ .78, or in AD patients, c2 (2) ¼ 5.48, p ¼ .06, although it was marginally signiﬁcant for the latter group.  3.2.1.1.2. AGE OF FACES. For ManneWhitney tests, a Bonferroni correction was applied on the statistical signiﬁcance level; p < .00625 was considered as signiﬁcant.  ManneWhitney tests were used to compare the two groups' performance according to the identity and age of the faces in the photographs, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. The only signiﬁcant difference between the two groups concerned selfface recognition from recent photos, U ¼ 196.5, zadj ¼  3.09, padj ¼ .002; the AD group (M ¼ 87, SD ¼ 22.09) was less accurate than the control group (M ¼ 99.5, SD ¼ 2.50). All other analyses were non-signiﬁcant (all ps > .01).  Friedman tests revealed no signiﬁcant effect of the age of faces when considering each group and the identity of faces separately (all ps > .10), as shown in Tables 4 and 5.  3.2.1.2.

These results indicate that higher connectivity between the dMPFC and the rSFG is associated with worse recognition scores. There was no signiﬁcant correlation between recognition scores (self, recent self, relative) and the connectivity maps of the PCC seed, a region that also belongs to the DMN.  The overlap between the rSFG and the connectivity maps identiﬁed by NEDICA indicated that this region is likely to belong to the central executive network (CEN) (see Table 7 and Fig. 6).  In order to assess the speciﬁcity of the correlation to the recognition of familiar (own or relative's) faces, we examined whether general face processing abilities, as indexed by Benton facial recognition scores, were also negatively correlated with dMPFC functional connectivity, but no such negative correlation was found in our study.  3.3.  Discussion  This experiment examined self- and familiar-face recognition in the moderate stages of AD and showed a deﬁcit affecting self-face and familiar-face recognition in our sample of moderate AD patients, along with a preserved capacity to identify unknown faces. Interestingly, the AD patients' performance was highly variable and not all patients had this deﬁcit. Indeed, 52% of the AD patients (13/25) obtained a perfect score for self-face recognition, 56% (14/25) obtained a perfect score for familiar face recognition, and 40% (10/25) recognized both self and familiar faces perfectly. Moreover, as a group, the AD patients had problems with general face processing, which was correlated with poorer self-face recognition. Therefore, from a clinical viewpoint, one cannot rule out the possibility that the impairment in self- (and familiar-) face recognition may be at least partly due to impaired face processing abilities. Nevertheless, such an impairment was not conﬁrmed by the clinical and cerebral connectivity correlation. And it is noteworthy that the MMSE score was not related to performance on self- and familiarface recognition.  A second objective of the experiment was to examine the occurrence of a temporally graded loss of self-face recognition in moderate AD patients. No temporal gradient seems to occur  Table 6 e Spearman's correlations between face recognition, disease severity and face processing.  Self face Familiar face  MMSE  .28 (p ¼ .17) .15 (p ¼ .48)  Benton Facial Recognition Test  .53 (p ¼ .006) .30 (p ¼ .14)  in self-face recognition since no effect of the age of faces was observed in the AD patients. However, only 60% of AD patients achieved a perfect score for self-face recognition in recent photographs whereas 84% of them scored perfectly for selfface recognition in photographs taken at the age of 20e30. The difference between these two proportions was marginally signiﬁcant (p ¼ .058). Moreover, in comparison to healthy older adults, AD patients performed worse for recent self-face photographs, but no difference between the two groups was found for older self-face photographs. Taken together, these data suggest that self-face recognition from the recent past might possibly be more affected in AD than self-face recognition from the remote past.  Resting-state fMRI data enabled us to examine the neural correlates of the impairments detected for own- and familiarface recognition in AD, with a particular emphasis on DMN connectivity, in light of the DMN region's involvement in familiar-face recognition and the vulnerability of this network to AD pathology. The results showed a signiﬁcant negative correlation between the dMPFC and rSFG connectivity level and different familiar-face recognition scores (self, recent self and relatives). These results remained signiﬁcant when controlling for the severity of dementia (MMSE) in moderate AD. Moreover, they appear to be speciﬁc to self- and familiar-face recognition as there was no correlation with scores indexing the general ability to process faces. In other words, the results showed that the greater the connectivity between the dMPFC and rSFG, the lower the behavioral recognition scores. We hypothesized that the relationship between face recognition and DMN connectivity could take one of two forms: either higher functional connectivity within the DMN being associated with better recognition scores, or greater inter-network (DMN vs other networks) connectivity being related to worse recognition performance. In support of the former hypothesis, Damoiseaux et al. (2008) showed that in healthy older people, decreased connectivity within an anterior resting-state network was associated with cognitive decline. Furthermore, better connectivity between DMN regions has been associated with higher self-appraisal scores (Ries et al., 2012). The current ﬁndings, however, supported the latter hypothesis: poorer self- and familiar-face recognition is related to greater functional connectivity between two regions belonging respectively to the DMN and CEN.  Accordingly, increased connectivity, reﬂecting functional dedifferentiation of speciﬁc brain regions, is associated with poorer recognition scores. In other words, it could be that AD patients, in a poorly controlled attempt to compensate for difﬁculties, activate an rSFG region together with the dMPFC and, in doing so, are adopting a strategy that is deleterious to their performance. A general interpretation of these results could be that less segregation between networks in AD leads  c o r t e x 6 7 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 5 9 e7 3  69  Table 7 e Clusters in the rSFG connected to the dMPFC seed, where connectivity level is negatively correlated with recognition scores.

In the current study, it could thus be argued that, given the dMPFC's importance in selfrelated processes, information related to the self (self face or familiar faces) might be processed automatically by regions of the DMN, but the recruitment of another brain region belonging to another (executive) network involved in attentional control could affect this automatic processing. In other words, networks that are not intended to work together do so because they are less segregated as a result of AD.  Support for the idea of reduced segregation comes from recent studies (Brier et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2007) showing that AD patients demonstrate a decrease in the typical anticorrelation between resting-state networks (Fox et al., 2005). Anti-correlated networks consist of regions that normally exhibit task-related activations (e.g., the executive or frontoparietal control network) and regions that normally exhibit task-related deactivations (e.g., the DMN). Inter-network connectivity (connectivity between regions belonging to different resting state networks) is in our study characterized  by deleterious increase of correlation between regions belonging to the task positive and task negative networks.  Consistent with the reductions in these anti-correlations shown in AD patients (Brier et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2007), we propose that less segregation between the DMN and the executive network leads to interference between those networks (i.e., an increase in neural noise). This lower segregation is associated with reduced efﬁciency of the processes supported by the DMN, which in this study would correspond to recognition of self or familiar faces. In the current study, this interpretation suggests that interference in DMN functioning is associated with a decreased capacity to recognize one's own and familiar faces. Future studies should examine whether other processes related to the DMN are also disturbed by interference from other networks.  The present fMRI study has several limitations. The ﬁrst one is the choice of a priori ROIs based on the literature. Even if the method is appropriate as the ROIs come from independent data sets, it may not be the optimal procedure. A better procedure would perhaps have been to use, as seed regions,  Fig. 6 e Connectivity (red line) between the dorsomedial prefrontal seed (above) and the right superior frontal gyrus (represented in its three axes). In the right superior corner, graph of the negative correlation of the dMPFC/rSFG connectivity level and familiar face recognition scores.  70  c o r t e x 6 7 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 5 9 e7 3  areas activated during an fMRI familiar face recognition task within the target population. It is however quite challenging to carry out such tasks with AD patients. In addition, in order to demonstrate the speciﬁcity of these signiﬁcant results by choosing one particular ROI (dMPFC), we showed that correlation analyses performed with a few other regions belonging either to the DMN (PCC) or other resting-state networks, notably the salience networks (right and left insula e data not shown) or ventral visual pathway regions (fusiform gyrus and anterior ventral temporal pole e data not shown), did not provide any signiﬁcant results. A second limitation is the absence of correlation analyses in a healthy older control group. Indeed, without such a group, we cannot (and do not) claim that the result we found in our study is speciﬁc to the AD patient population in general. Another drawback is the fact that we used correlations between scores and resting-state data, thus examining an indirect link between scores and neural or cortical activation. To get around this problem, future work could examine this issue with task-related fMRI studies examining self- and familiar-face recognition. One would however need to overcome some difﬁculties. Indeed, given that, in our study, we were particularly interested in the processing of self-recognition from photographs taken at different periods of life, it would have been particularly difﬁcult for each patient to collect enough photographs representing the different periods of his/her life to meet the requirements of fMRI methodology. Furthermore, fMRI taskrelated approaches are constraining and difﬁcult to realize with AD patients, given their cognitive and behavioral difﬁculties, especially at more advanced stages of the disease.  4.  General discussion  This study revealed that impairment in self- and familiar face recognition occurred in the moderate stages of AD. However, the severity of the disease was not linearly related to face recognition performance. Moreover, there is heterogeneity among patients with AD. Indeed, one mild AD patient scored poorly for familiar face recognition. Inversely, 40% of moderate AD patients obtained a perfect score on both self and familiar face recognition task. Therefore, these ﬁndings indicated that, in the mild AD stages, impairment in self or familiar face recognition accuracy is infrequent, while they are globally slower than controls for providing answers. However, in the moderate AD stages, the probability to develop impairment in self- and familiar face recognition is increased. Such variability in face recognition performance appeared to be related to variability in cerebral functional connectivity. Furthermore, although mild AD patients had no difﬁculty with face processing in general, moderate AD patients showed impaired performance on Benton's face processing task, which was related to self-face recognition.  Our study also examined the occurrence of a temporally graded loss of self-face recognition. In mild AD patients and their healthy controls, an inverse temporal gradient was observed for RTs, with faster recognition of recent photographs than remote photographs, regardless of the identity of the faces. Two hypotheses were proposed to explain these unexpectedly result. First, faces from the remote past might  cause a “surprise” reaction that increases reaction time. In support of this, some of the participants did comment about seeing themselves or their spouses at a younger age. The second explanation is that access to self or familiar faces from the remote past might be more difﬁcult than access to such faces from the recent past; this decrease in accessibility might increase reaction times. In the moderate stages of AD, although no temporal gradient was observed, recognition of self faces from the remote past was slightly better preserved than recognition of self faces from the recent past.  The face is the most distinctive feature of our physical appearance and is critical to a sense of self (Heatherton, Macrae, & Kelley, 2004; Tsakiris, 2008). In social interactions, distinguishing between oneself and other people is essential (Van Veluw & Chance, 2014). Self-face recognition is also considered to be a cue of self-awareness (Gallup, 1982; Van Veluw & Chance, 2014). The persistence of the sense of self in AD is currently a matter of debate in the literature (Cadell & Clare, 2010). The self has been subdivided into different functionally isolable components, such as episodic memories of one's life events, semantic summary representations of one's personality traits, semantic knowledge of facts about one's life, sense of personal agency and ownership, ability to self-reﬂect, and physical self (Klein & Gangi, 2010). The present study revealed that the sense of the physical self may be impaired in moderate AD. It adds to the growing body of data demonstrating that some components of the self can be spared while others are impaired (Klein, Cosmides, & Costabile, 2003; Klein & Gangi, 2010). However, in this study, it appears that it is mainly the sense of the recent physical self that is impaired in moderate AD patients, whereas memory of the premorbid physical appearance seems to be intact.  In the behavioral study, recognition scores for self and familiar faces were highly correlated. Furthermore, with the resting-state fMRI data, we obtained the same result for each recognition score: self, recent self and relative recognition. This result may suggest that the same mechanism is operating for self- and personally familiar-face recognition in our AD patients. The ﬁnding that the same areas could be involved in both kinds of recognition is not new. Indeed, both self and personally familiar faces elicit activation in cortical midline structures (Gobbini & Haxby, 2007), which are also involved in theory of mind and mental state attribution. More speciﬁcally, the dMPFC has been implicated in a wide range of studies that require subjects to think or to infer other people's mental states (Frith & Frith, 2001; Mitchell, Banaji, & Macrae, 2005). During face recognition in healthy subjects, activity in this region has been linked to more complex forms of discrimination between the self and others (Platek & Kemp, 2009; Uddin et al., 2005). Thus, recruitment of brain areas associated with theory of mind could explain why similar mechanisms were operating and may have led to similar results for AD patients' recognition of their own faces and personally familiar faces.  Finally, our fMRI results suggest that the impaired recognition of familiar faces in moderate AD is associated with modiﬁed functional connectivity between different restingstate networks. Future studies should examine whether the modiﬁed connectivity found in our AD subjects is also present in earlier or prodromal stages of the disease (mild cognitive impairment) and healthy older controls.  c o r t e x 6 7 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 5 9 e7 3  71  Acknowledgments  This work was supported by the SAO-FRA grant S#12005, ARC 12/17-01 REST, Inter-University Attraction Pole P7/11, the F.R.S.-FNRS, and the University of Liege.  r e f e r e n c e s  Agosta, F., Pievani, M., Geroldi, C., Copetti, M., Frisoni, G.

However, its effects on intrinsic low-frequency connectivity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) and its related anti-correlated network (ACN) have not been well characterized. We investigated the effect of SD on functional connectivity within the DMN, and on DMN-ACN anti-correlation, both during the resting state and during performance of a visual attention task (VAT). 26 healthy participants underwent fMRI twice: once after a normal night of sleep in rested wakefulness (RW) and once following approximately 24 h of total SD. A seed-based approach was used to examine pairwise correlations of lowfrequency fMRI signal across different nodes in each state. SD was associated with signiﬁcant selective reductions in DMN functional connectivity and DMN-ACN anti-correlation. This was congruent across resting state and VAT analyses, suggesting that SD induces a robust alteration in the intrinsic connectivity within and between these networks.  © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  A single night of total sleep deprivation (SD) can result in behavioral deﬁcits with accompanying alterations in neural activation patterns (Chee and Chuah, 2008; Goel et al., 2009). To date, the focus of most research has been on delineating the regional effects of SD on attention (Chee et al., 2008; Lim and Dinges, 2008; Tomasi et al., 2009), short-term memory (Chee and Chuah, 2007) and executive function (Nilsson et al., 2005). In contrast, far less is known about the effect of sleep deprivation on intrinsic low-frequency connectivity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) and its anti-correlated network (ACN).  The DMN is a network of brain regions that consistently deactivates in response to externally oriented tasks (Raichle et al., 2001; Shulman et al., 1997) and activates in response to numerous tasks involving internally oriented cognition (Bar, 2007; Binder et al., 2009; D'Argembeau et al., 2005; Hassabis and Maguire, 2007). The main DMN nodes—the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus and retrosplenial cortex, the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), lateral temporal cortex (LTC), and hippocampal formation (Buckner et al., 2008)—show correlated low-frequency BOLD signal ﬂuctuations, suggesting functional connectivity (Greicius et al., 2003).  ⁎ Corresponding author at: Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, 8 College Road, Level 6, Singapore 169857, Singapore.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.08.026  Interestingly, these low-frequency signals are anti-correlated with several regions normally activated as a group by externally oriented tasks (Fox et al., 2005). This anti-correlated network (ACN) includes the frontal eye ﬁelds (FEF), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), middle temporal region (MT), supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior parietal lobule (also referred to as the temporoparietal junction (TPJ; Corbetta and Shulman, 2002), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and Insula (Fox et al., 2005). Switching between externally and internally oriented cognition is thought to be mediated via a competitive relationship between the ACN and DMN (Fox and Raichle, 2007; Fox et al., 2005).  Relevant to the current work, DMN connectivity and anticorrelation is diminished in many neurological and psychiatric disorders (Broyd et al., 2009; Buckner et al., 2008). Functional connectivity within the DMN is also diminished when healthy persons enter deep sleep (Horovitz et al., 2009). Both DMN functional connectivity and anti-correlation are reduced subsequent to general anesthesia (Boveroux et al., 2010; Deshpande et al., 2010), leading to the notion that diminished DMN connectivity and anti-correlation can index disrupted brain function in a variety of contexts. This motivated us to investigate if DMN connectivity and anti-correlation is altered in healthy persons undergoing a night of total SD, given the association of this state with aforementioned alterations in cognitive function.  Several SD studies evaluating short-term memory (Chee and Choo, 2004; Chee and Chuah, 2007; Choo et al., 2005) have revealed reduction in task-related deactivation across several nodes of the DMN. However, a recent study evaluating working memory reported reduced deactivation in the MPFC along with increased precuneus  1746  J.A. De Havas et al. / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 1745–1751  deactivation (Gujar et al., 2010), suggesting altered functional connectivity between DMN nodes during SD. Indeed, recent work involving partial SD reported such reductions in DMN functional connectivity, along with reduced anti-correlation between the DMN and ACN (Sämann et al., 2010).  Functional connectivity involving the DMN has typically been evaluated using resting state data, but data acquired while participants perform tasks has also been used (Fair et al., 2007; Fransson, 2006; Greicius et al., 2003; Greicius and Menon, 2004). One approach is to regress out task-related activity before evaluating DMN functional connectivity (Fair et al., 2007). Although some studies suggest that this approach generates results comparable to those obtained from resting state data (Arfanakis et al., 2000; Fair et al., 2007), others suggest otherwise (Esposito et al., 2006, 2009; Fransson, 2006).  In the present study, we evaluated the effect of SD on functional connectivity within the DMN and anti-correlation between the DMN and ACN, both during resting state and while volunteers performed a visual attention task (VAT). This comparison is important in SD studies because sleepiness increases in the supine position (Caldwell et al., 2003) and is expected to be accentuated following sleep deprivation, particularly in the absence of task performance. As such, it might be useful to assess changes in network connectivity while a person is engaged in a task to reduce the likelihood of volunteers falling asleep.  Materials and methods  Participants  Twenty-six healthy right-handed volunteers (11 male, 22.5± 2.0 years) participated in the experiment after giving informed consent. Participants were selected from respondents to a web-based questionnaire. They had to: (1) be right-handed, (2) be between 18 and 35 years of age, (3) have habitual good sleeping habits (sleeping no less than 6.5 h each night for the past one month), (4) not be of extreme morning or evening chronotype (score no greater than 22 on a modiﬁed Morningness–Eveningness scale; Horne and Ostberg, 1976), (5) not be on any long-term medications, (6) have no symptoms associated with sleep disorders, and (7) have no history of any psychiatric or neurologic disorders.  The sleeping habits of all participants were monitored throughout the two-week duration of the study, and only those whose actigraphy data indicated habitual good sleep (i.e., slept no later than 0100 h and woke no later than 0900 h) were recruited for the study.  Study procedure  Participants visited the laboratory three times. First, they attended a brieﬁng session during which they were informed about the study protocol and practiced on the experimental task. At the end of this session, every participant was given a wrist actigraph to wear throughout the study. The second and third visits involved participating in the actual fMRI experiment. The ﬁrst scanning session took place approximately one week after the initial visit. The order of the two sessions: rested wakefulness (RW) and sleep deprivation (SD), was counterbalanced across all the participants and separated by one week. This was to minimize the possibility of residual effects of sleep deprivation on cognition in participants whose sleep-deprivation session preceded their rested wakefulness session. The RW session took place at 0800 h. During the SD session, participants were monitored in the lab from 1900 h onward and scanning took place the next day at approximately 0500 h. During the SD session, participants were allowed to engage in non-strenuous activities such as reading and watching videos. Vigorous physical activity prior to the scans was not permitted. All participants indicated that they did  not smoke or consume any medications, stimulants, caffeine or alcohol for at least 24 h prior to scanning.  Experimental task  The VAT stimuli (Fig. 1) were single large, global letters (H or S; letters (H or S; 3.3° × 2.1°) composed of several, smaller local 0.6°×0.4°) (Navon, 1977). The global letter and the local letters were either congruent (i.e., a global H made up of local Hs and global S made up of local Ss) or incongruent (i.e., a global H made up of local Ss and global Ss made up of local Hs). In each trial, a single stimulus was presented centrally for 200 ms, and participants identiﬁed either the smaller, local letters or the larger, global letters by pressing one of two buttons. At the start of each run participants were told whether they would be responding to the global or local letters. For example, during a local run they were told to respond only to the local letters for the entire duration of the run. Participants performed 3 runs of the global task and 3 runs of the local task. There were 96 trials in each run, with equal numbers of congruent stimuli and incongruent stimuli. The trials were presented in a counterbalanced order that was predetermined for each participant such that there was an equal likelihood of a trial type appearing after every trial type in the design. The inter-trial interval (ITI) ranged from 3.0 to 9.0 s (mean ITI=4.2 s) following an exponential distribution that favored short ITIs. This distribution has been shown by simulation to be efﬁcient in uncovering differences in signal strength elicited by various experimental conditions (Hagberg et al., 2001).  Stimuli were presented with MR-compatible LCD goggles (Resonance Technology, Los Angeles, USA), and participants responded using a button box held in the right hand.  Fig. 1. Stimulus layout for VAT. Stimuli were single large, global letters made up of smaller local letters. Global and local letters were either congruent (i.e., a global H made up of local Hs) or incongruent (i.e., a global H made up of local Ss). During each trial, a single stimulus was presented centrally. Participants identiﬁed either the local or global letters by pressing one of two buttons.  J.A. De Havas et al. / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 1745–1751  1747  Resting state run  Following the VAT, participants completed a resting state run, during which they were instructed to lie still with their eyes focused on the central ﬁxation cross for 8 min. Participants were told to avoid head movements and swallowing.  Imaging procedure and analysis  Images were acquired on a 3T TIM Trio system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). A gradient echo-planar imaging sequence was used with TR of 1500 ms, ﬁeld of view of 192×192 mm and a 64×64 mm pixel matrix. Twenty-eight oblique axial slices (4 mm thick with a 0.4 mm inter-slice gap) parallel to the AC–PC line were acquired. Highresolution coplanar T1 images (0.75 × 0.75 × 4.4 mm) were also obtained to facilitate coregistration. A further high-resolution anatomical reference image was acquired using a 3D-MPRAGE sequence for the purpose of Talairach normalization.  The functional images were processed using Brain Voyager QX version 1.10.3 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, Netherlands). To correct for motion across runs, all functional images were aligned using rigid body transformation to the ﬁrst image of the functional run acquired immediately before the coplanar T1-weighted image. Inter-slice timing differences attributable to slice acquisition order were adjusted using cubic spline interpolation. Gaussian ﬁltering was applied in the spatial domain using a smoothing kernel of 8 mm FWHM for group level analyses. The functional data was coregistered to the high-resolution anatomical image using the T1 coplanar image, before being resampled to 3 mm isovoxel resolution in Talairach space using afﬁne transformation (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988).  The main analysis involving the VAT used a single run of the task, which was truncated to have the same number of time points as the resting state analysis (318 time points). Run 3 of the VAT was selected, to minimize potential confounds such as time on task effects (Lim et al., 2010).  A band pass ﬁlter (0.009–0.09 Hz) was applied to reduce the effect of high frequency noise and very low-frequency drifts (AndrewsHanna et al., 2007; Lowe et al., 1998; Sämann et al., 2010). For each data set, a separate general linear model (GLM) analysis was then performed including the following parameters: 1) the global brain signal (including signal from ventricular CSF), and 2) the six motion correction parameters. In addition, for the VAT data, task-related activity was modeled with ﬁnite impulse response function predictors (14 timepoints, covering 21 s). The residuals were then obtained by subtracting the estimated GLM model from the time series, and used for connectivity analyses. Previous studies have found that spontaneous synchronized activity in the DMN identiﬁed after regressing out task-related activity can yield similar results to resting state data (Fair et al., 2007).  Functional connectivity was determined in the same manner for the resting state and VAT analyses. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected independently for resting state and VAT based on RW wholebrain correlation maps with an a priori deﬁned PCC seed (9×9 ×9 mm cube) taken from the literature (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2007). Despite independent selection, node locations were highly consistent across VAT and resting state analyses (Fig. 2; Suppl Tables 1 and 2).  Six additional DMN ROI whose time series showed maximum positive correlation with the PCC seed were selected: dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortices (dMPFC, vMPFC), bilateral inferior parietal lobules (LIPL, RIPL) and bilateral lateral temporal cortices (LLTC, RLTC).  Six ACN nodes were also selected based on voxels showing maximal anti-correlation with the PCC seed: bilateral insula (L Insula, R Insula), bilateral intraparietal sulcus (LIPS, RIPS) and bilateral temporoparietal junction (LTPJ, RTPJ). These speciﬁc nodes were chosen based on reports that they belong to putative sub-networks of  the ACN: the insula is implicated in a salience network (Seeley et al., 2007; Sridharan et al., 2008); the IPS in the dorsal attention network; and the TPJ in the ventral attention network (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Fox et al., 2006a).  For RW and SD, functional connectivity during resting state and VAT analyses was assessed by computing pairwise correlations across the 7 DMN nodes and between the 7 DMN nodes and 6 ACN nodes (time series averaged across a cube of size 9 ×9×9 mm). The r values were Fisher-transformed (z’) before further parametric statistical analyses to ensure that the data approximated a normal distribution. To determine the effect of SD on functional connectivity and anticorrelation, 2×2 repeated measures ANOVA were performed on the z′ values obtained from each node pairing (data type; resting state vs. VAT×state; RW vs. SD). All statistics were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons.  An additional analysis to investigate functional connectivity changes within the DMN across state was carried out using all 6 runs of the VAT. Here, preprocessing and analysis was the same as the above VAT analysis. However, the 6 DMN ROI were picked independently for each run. Pearson's r values for each of the node pairings in RW and SD were then averaged across the 6 runs. These averaged r values were then Fisher-transformed, before two-tailed, repeated measures t-tests between RW and SD (Bonferroni corrected) were performed on the z’ values obtained from each node pairing.  Behavioral analysis  Response time was determined using only trials with correct responses (correct RT), excluding lapse trials (no response or RT N3000 ms). The intra-individual coefﬁcient of variation was calculated for each participant by dividing the standard deviation of correct RT by the mean correct RT. This value was then averaged across participants for each state.  Behavioral accuracy was measured using corrected recognition (Hits–False Alarms). Behavioral deﬁcits related to SD were evaluated using paired one-tailed t-tests. SD-related functional connectivity reduction and SD-related declines in behavioral performance were then correlated to examine the functional consequences of changes in DMN connectivity and behavior.  Results  Behavioral ﬁndings  Sleep deprivation resulted in a decline in response accuracy (RW mean accuracy 89.4%, SD mean accuracy 77.8%; t25=5.15, p b0.0001; Table 1). The number of behavioral lapses increased during SD relative to RW (12.5% vs. 2.8%; t25 =5.65, p b0.0001). SD resulted in slower responses (RTcorrect 687 ms vs. RTcorrect 632 ms; t25 =3.38, p b0.01) and increased intra-individual variability in response time (0.29 vs. 0.22; t25 =4.78, p b0.0001).  Reduced functional connectivity within DMN nodes: observed in both VAT and resting state analyses  Within the DMN, there was a main effect of state on the functional connectivity of 3 node pairs: dMPFC and LIPL; vMPFC and LIPL; PCC and LIPL (Fig. 3; Suppl. Table 3).  Reduced anti-correlation between DMN and ACN nodes: observed in both VAT and resting state analyses  A main effect of state was found on the anti-correlation between 20 DMN-ACN node pairs. The effect was mostly present between lateral nodes of the DMN, particularly IPL, and much of the ACN (Fig. 4; Suppl. Table 4).  1748  J.A. De Havas et al. / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 1745–1751  Fig. 2. DMN and ACN node location in Rest and VAT. Correlation maps between an a priori selected PCC seed (9× 9×9 mm cube) and all other voxels in the brain. All other nodes were selected based on the r values (9 ×9×9 mm cube centered on peak voxel), 6 from the DMN (positive r, yellow labels), and 6 from the ACN (negative r, blue labels). The nodes were deﬁned separately for the resting state and VAT data, but show a high degree of spatial overlap (Suppl. Tables 1 and 2). Black squares depict actual voxels selected for each node.  Effects of data type or interaction between data type and state  Discussion  Within the DMN, no signiﬁcant effects of data type, or interactions between data type and state, were found (Suppl. Table 3). Between the DMN and ACN, a single signiﬁcant data type by state interaction was found between LLTC and LTPJ (F1,25=21.00, p b0.001).  The effect of utilizing additional VAT runs  Analysis was also conducted using the average of all 6 VAT runs. Within the DMN, 14 node pairings showed a signiﬁcant negative effect of SD on functional connectivity (Fig. 5).  We found SD to be associated with reduced functional connectivity within the DMN and reduced anti-correlation between the DMN and ACN. This was true for both resting state and VAT analyses. Declines in DMN connectivity and anti-correlation consistently affected the IPL nodes. Despite inherent differences between resting state and VAT time series, there was no signiﬁcant effect of data type or interaction between data type and state when comparing data of equivalent duration. However, analyzing the data using multiple VAT runs uncovered more extensive declines in DMN functional connectivity. Finally, despite the unequivocal state changes in connectivity and  Absence of brain-behavior correlation  The observed decline (RW-SD) in functional connectivity between 3 DMN node pairings during the resting state did not signiﬁcantly correlate with any of the behavioral measures derived from the VAT (RW-SD; corrected accuracy, RTcorrected, RT variability and behavioral lapses; Suppl. Table 5). This was also true of the decline in functional connectivity within the DMN during VAT (Suppl. Table 6) and of the SD-related reduced anti-correlation, both during resting state and VAT (Suppl. Tables 5 and 6).

Fig. 3. Main effect of state on DMN functional connectivity. A signiﬁcant main effect of state on DMN functional connectivity was found between 3 node pairs; LIPL and dMPFC, LIPL and vMPFC, and LIPL and PCC (Bonferroni corrected p b0.05/21 =0.002).  J.A. De Havas et al. / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 1745–1751  1749  also been demonstrated after Propofol-induced loss of consciousness (Boveroux et al., 2010). Moreover, these within and between network decouplings appear to be graded, with deeper anesthesia being associated with more widespread losses of connectivity (Boveroux et al., 2010; Deshpande et al., 2010).  We found that SD-related alterations in connectivity and anticorrelation most consistently involved the IPL nodes. Previous work has found SD-related reduced IPL deactivation during a visual shortterm memory task (Chee and Chuah, 2007), while resting state analysis has revealed reductions in IPL-MPFC functional connectivity during sleep (Horovitz et al., 2009) and after partial SD (Sämann et al., 2010). The IPL region is implicated in diverse cognitive operations (Laird et al., 2009), including bodily awareness (Felician et al., 2009), generating a sense of personal responsibility (Schaich Borg et al., 2006), and moral decision-making (Raine and Yang, 2006). These functions correspond to behaviors negatively affected by SD. Bodily connection (Giesbrecht et al., 2007), blame acceptance (Kahn-Greene et al., 2006), and responding to personal moral dilemmas (Killgore et al., 2007) are all impaired following SD. Further work is needed to explore whether this cluster of deﬁcits maps onto SD-related reduced IPL functional connectivity and anti-correlation.  Fig. 4. Main effect of state on DMN-ACN anti-correlation. A signiﬁcant main effect of state on anti-correlation was found between 20 DMN-ACN node pairs (Bonferroni corrected p b0.05/42 =0.001).  anti-correlation, there was no signiﬁcant correlation between these alterations and behavioral changes induced by sleep deprivation.  Task data compliments resting state  SD is associated with reductions in DMN functional connectivity and anti-correlation  Reduced responsiveness to the environment is associated with declines in functional connectivity within and between brain networks. Reduced functional connectivity between anterior and posterior midline nodes of the DMN was observed during the transition into slow-wave sleep (Horovitz et al., 2009; Sämann et al., 2011). Slow-wave sleep has also been associated with reduced anti-correlation between the DMN and nodes of the ACN, such as the insula (Sämann et al., 2011). Such ﬁndings are not limited to deep sleep. They have been demonstrated during light sleep (Sämann et al., 2011) and after partial sleep deprivation (Sämann et al., 2010). Indeed, when responsiveness to the external environment is pharmacologically suppressed, connectivity between the PCC and other DMN nodes was similarly reduced (Greicius et al., 2008). Reduced anti-correlation between the DMN and parts of the ACN has  Fig. 5. Effect of state on DMN functional connectivity: average of 6 VAT runs. An analysis using an average of 6 VAT runs found extensive functional connectivity declines within the DMN after SD. t-tests showed signiﬁcant effects of SD in 14 of 21 node pairings (RW NSD, Bonferroni corrected p b0.05/21 =0.002).  We explored whether the effects of SD on the DMN and ACN would be detectable in the underlying BOLD signal after regressing out taskrelated activity. As we sought to reduce the effect of sleep intrusions on the data, we originally anticipated this data type to be less sensitive to connectivity alterations than the resting state data. This is because performance of the VAT ensured participants maintained a higher degree of wakefulness. However, we found only a single signiﬁcant interaction between data type and state, and no main effects of data type, both within the DMN, and between the DMN and ACN.  While in broad agreement with previous work comparing resting state connectivity inferred from task-related and resting state data (Fair et al., 2007), these present results differ from ICA-based studies. These latter studies have reported changes in the spatial extent of functional connectivity within the DMN with increased working memory load relative to resting state data (Esposito et al., 2006, 2009). The absence of such changes in the current study may stem from a difference in the measure of interest. Rather than focus on spatial extent, the seed-based approach used here compared correlations between spatially bounded nodes.  We found reduced DMN functional connectivity and anti-correlation during the VAT. This ﬁnding concurs with studies showing SD-related reduced DMN deactivation during task performance (Chee and Choo, 2004; Chee and Chuah, 2007; Choo et al., 2005). Intrinsic low-frequency activity has been postulated to inﬂuence activity at higher-frequency bands via power modulations (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004; Leopold et al., 2003). In support of this, intrinsic activity in motor regions has been shown to account for a signiﬁcant proportion of the inter-trial variability in activity evoked by a button press task (Fox et al., 2006b), and for variance in behavioural performance (Fox et al., 2007). Thus, altered low-frequency functional connectivity within the DMN, and between the DMN and ACN, could contribute to impaired task-related DMN deactivation after SD.  Potential beneﬁts of using multi-run task data to assess DMN connectivity  We found that using multiple VAT runs uncovered more extensive alteration in DMN functional connectivity after SD. Research on underlying correlations in low-frequency activity in the DMN and ACN often involves only resting state data, because it is straightforward to acquire, and “uncontaminated” by task activity (Fransson, 2006). Comparisons across groups or states are thus typically based on a single run of 6–10 min. Acquiring more resting state data to increase  1750  J.A. De Havas et al. / NeuroImage 59 (2012) 1745–1751  the power to detect subtle alterations between groups may decrease the signal to noise ratio due to factors such as increased head motion (Fox and Greicius, 2010). Additionally, it might be difﬁcult to elicit the co-operation of volunteers with behavioral abnormalities, young children or those who are disposed to falling asleep. Using task data may circumvent some of these issues. Multiple runs are already collected, allowing an analysis based on markedly more data points. Critically, the present study demonstrates that task data can be used to show both equivalent results to resting state when the volume of data is matched, and more extensive effects when multiple task runs are used.  Absence of brain-behavior correlations  Despite unequivocal SD-related behavioral declines in VAT performance and reductions in both DMN functional connectivity and DMN-ACN anti-correlation, no signiﬁcant correlations were found between these measures at the level of individual subjects. This was unexpected, given that stop-signal errors (Li et al., 2007) and lapses of attention (Weissman et al., 2006) have been associated with a failure to deactivate the DMN. However, little is known about how intrinsic activity interacts with task-related activity, and by extension, behavioral performance (Northoff et al., 2010). Furthermore, the few studies that do report correlations between resting functional connectivity and behavioral measures (e.g. Kelly et al., 2008) have tended to use attention-demanding tasks such as the Eriksen ﬂanker task. Delineating the intrinsic network properties that correlate with less demanding tasks such as the VAT may require a ﬁne-grained approach that goes beyond examining limited DMN and ACN nodes.  Limitations  Analysis was restricted to bivariate correlations between node pairs. Consequently, only relative changes between nodes could be detected. It was not possible to determine how SD affected individual nodes, or how the nodes inﬂuenced one another across states. Techniques such as ICA and Granger causality analysis could be used in the future to explore these questions. Further, the results of our task analysis were based on a single VAT. As such, they apply primarily to visual attention and cannot be generalized to other behavioural domains.  Conclusion  SD was associated with reduced DMN functional connectivity and DMN-ACN anti-correlation. This was true in the resting state and VAT analyses. The IPL node of the DMN was consistently impaired and may represent an early marker for the effects of SD, as well as an indicator of hitherto unexplored behavioural impairments. We demonstrated that task data could be used to show equivalent results to resting state when the volume of data was matched, supporting the notion that reduced deactivation after SD may be related to intrinsic DMN impairment. Moreover, we found more extensive effects of SD when multiple task runs were used, implying that under certain conditions task data may be preferable. How functional connectivity relates to behaviour and stimulus-evoked activation and deactivation of the DMN and ACN remains to be elucidated. SD is a useful assay for such questions since it represents one of the few reversible state changes that allows participants to perform relatively demanding tasks.

However, it is not known whether there exists a particular network that becomes more active when a person is engaged in a social interaction. fMRI was used to measure brain activity in subjects as they completed a social interactive task and a non-social control task sharing many of the same features. Comparison across the two tasks revealed a network of functionally connected areas that was consistently more active in the social task. This network included default mode network areas, raising the possibility that activity previously observed in default mode regions at rest is related to social cognition. Within this network, information appears to flow from regions involved in salience detection (e.g. anterior insula) to regions involved in mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) to regions involved in executive control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). In a second experiment, subjects played the same social interactive task with alleged members of both an experimentally induced in-group and out-group. The default mode network was again active during the task, and several noteworthy differences distinguished interactions with in-group and out-group partners, providing a potential neural substrate for the human tendency to more readily identify with in-group members and more readily distrust, fear and discriminate against out-group members. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.044  Introduction  Recently, there has been a movement in cognitive neuroscience towards identifying functional networks of brain activity, as an adjunct to the standard approach of identifying maximal activations in specific brain regions. As many as 10 such networks have been identified in the resting state (Damoiseaux et al., 2006), including networks hypothesized to be involved in vision, sensorimotor processing, auditory processing, language, memory, executive control, emotional salience and self-referential processing (Beckmann et al., 2005; Biswal et al., 1995; Cordes et al., 2000; Fox et al., 2005; Fransson, 2005; Greicius et al., 2003; Lowe et al., 1998; Seeley et al., 2007). Activity in some of these networks is modulated as subjects transition from a resting state to goaldirected task engagement. As expected, some networks are amplified by tasks that engage their putative functions (De Luca et al., 2005; Fransson, 2005; Hampson et al., 2004, 2002). However, the default mode network is apparently attenuated by a wide range of goal-directed tasks, suggesting that it may be involved in resting state cognitive processes that are disrupted during goal-directed task engagement.  An important question for social neuroscience is whether a particular neural network becomes more active when a person is engaged in a social, interactive task compared to a non-social, goal-directed task. There is reason to think that the default mode network may behave in this way. The default mode network is hypothesized to relate to self-referential mental activity (Gusnard et al., 2001). However, according to simulation theory, we understand others' mental states by imagining our own thoughts, feelings or behaviors in a similar situation (Adolphs, 2002; Davies and Stone, 1995; Gallese and Goldman, 1998; Gordon, 1992; Iacoboni et al., 2005; Meltzoff and Brooks, 2001). Therefore, the default mode network may be involved in understanding other's mental states by way of simulation  1448  J.K. Rilling et al. / NeuroImage 41 (2008) 1447–1461  combined with mental self-reflection. Consistent with this hypothesis is considerable evidence suggesting that this network, or components of it, is involved in thinking about the mental states of others (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Buckner and Carroll, 2007; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Mitchell et al., 2002, 2006; Rilling et al., 2004). We therefore hypothesized that the default mode network would be more active during a social task that elicited mental perspective taking than during a non-social task. Experiment 1 was designed to test this hypothesis.  Experiment 2 was designed to evaluate whether any functional networks that are active during social interaction are modulated by the group identity of the playing partner, that is, whether the partner belongs to the subject's in-group or outgroup. There is abundant evidence from social psychology that people tend to more readily identify with in-group members and more readily distrust, fear and discriminate against out-group members (Hewstone et al., 2002). Early experiments showed that in-group, out-group biases could be elicited with surprising ease, even in the absence of conflicts of interest or a history of hostility between group members. Simply dividing subjects into groups on the basis of painting preferences or judgments of the number of dots in a cluster were sufficient to elicit these biases. These results were interpreted to suggest that group membership is internalized as a social is enhanced by distinguishing positively the in-group from the out-group (Tajfel and Turner, 1979). However, subsequent work established that discrimination in this minimal group paradigm (MGP), at least among male subjects, requires that subjects' payoffs are dependent on the actions of other in-group members. Thus, among males, discrimination in the MGP is thought to depend on a norm of reciprocity with in-group members (Gaertner and Insko, 2000).  identity that  Previous neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of social perception of in-group and out-group members, in which group status was racially defined (Eberhardt, 2005). These studies have focused on responses in the amygdala because of its role in processing threatening stimuli. Hart et al. (2000) demonstrated faster amygdala habituation to in-group compared with out-group faces and Phelps et al. (2000) showed that White subjects with the most negative implicit attitudes towards Blacks showed the largest differential amygdala response to Black as compared with White faces. Yet, amygdala responses to racial out-group faces are not inevitable. Wheeler and Fiske showed that amygdala activation to Black faces was only found when subjects were motivated to socially categorizing those faces (Wheeler and Fiske, 2005), and a study by Cunningham et al. (2004) suggested that White subjects could use prefrontal cortex to consciously regulate racial biases and dampen amygdala activation to Black faces. Nevertheless, these studies and to our knowledge all previous neuroimaging studies have only examined in-group–out-group effects on social perception, and not during dynamic social interaction. In this study, we used a minimal group paradigm to test for potential differences in functional connectivity during in-group and outgroup interactions. We experimentally induced in-group and outgroup status in each of two playing partners (see Materials and methods) and compared subjects' brain activity as they allegedly interacted with each. In actuality, to control for the behavior of the two playing partners, in-group and out-group partner choices were administered by the same pre-programmed computer algorithm (see Materials and methods).  Materials and methods  Experiment 1  Subjects  Twenty participants from the Emory University community were studied. Mean age was 20.8years (SD = 1.6). One motivation for this study was to compare results with a previous study that focused exclusively on female subjects (Rilling et al., 2002). To facilitate this comparison and improve statistical power, the present study was also restricted to females.  Behavioral procedures  Our social task is the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) Game, in which two players choose whether or not to cooperate with one another and receive a financial payoff that depends on the interaction of their two, independent choices. The payoff matrix in Fig. 1 specifies four possible outcomes of a round and their associated payoffs for both players: player A and player B cooperate (CC), player A cooperates and player B defects (CD), player A defects and player B cooperates (DC), or player A and player B defect (DD). The payoffs for the various outcomes are arranged such that DC N CC N DD N CD and CC N (CD + DC) / 2. Thus, choosing to cooperate is risky, because although it will yield a $2 payoff when the partner also cooperates, it will yield $0 if the partner defects. On the other hand, the lowest payoff for defecting is $1 (when the partner also defects).  Our non-social control task attempts to control for the frequency and amount of monetary payoffs, as well as non-social risk-taking behavior, and the proportion of risky choices that are rewarded. Subjects were asked to choose between a small but certain reward (100% chance of receiving $1) and a larger ($2) but uncertain reward, while being told only that the probability of the $2 reward was non-zero and that it fluctuated from trial to trial. In actuality, the probability was matched to the probability that cooperation was reciprocated in our earlier iterated PD study (77%) (Rilling et al., 2002). Thus, in both the PD and the Gamble tasks, subjects likely use past outcomes to calculate the wisdom of opting for a riskier, but potentially more rewarding outcome. However, PD game outcomes are dependent on the interaction of two autonomous agents, and in the PD game, subjects are likely additionally calculating how their current choices will affect the partner's future choices. Thus, the PD game is more complex than the gamble task. However, we believe this complexity results in large part from the fact that the task is social. In other words, part of what makes social tasks different from other tasks is their inherent complexity.  Subjects completed a 10-minute computer tutorial  that explained the Prisoner's Dilemma game, and were given a 2question multiple choice quiz to evaluate their understanding. If either question was answered incorrectly, study personnel explained to participants why that answer was wrong and why another answer was correct. If necessary, subjects repeated the tutorial. Study personnel continued with the experiment only after they were convinced that the subject fully comprehended the task. Subjects then completed two practice rounds of the PD game, as well as two practice rounds of the Gamble task using the response box they would be holding while in the scanner. The practice trials familiarized subjects with the feel of the game and the operation of the response box. Just prior to entering the scanner, subjects were introduced to two female confederates with whom  J.K. Rilling et al. / NeuroImage 41 (2008) 1447–1461  1449  fMRI image acquisition  Subjects lay motionless in a supine position in the scanner. Functional images were acquired on a Siemens 3T Trio scanner using an EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 25 ms, matrix = 64 × 64, FOV = 192mm, slice thickness = 3 mm, gap = 1 mm, 32 axial slices. The duration of each of the two EPI scans was 22min. These were followed by a 7min T1-weighted MPRAGE scan (TR = 2300 ms, TE = 4 ms, matrix = 256 × 256, slice thickness = 1.33 mm, gap = 0 mm).  fMRI image analysis  Image pre-processing was conducted using Brain Voyager QX (version 1.3.8) software (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Pre-processing involved image realignment using 6-parameter 3-D motion correction, slice scan time correction using linear interpolation, intensity normalization to the global mean of each image, spatial smoothing with a 10 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, and temporal smoothing using voxel-wise linear detrending and high pass filtering of frequencies below three cycles per run length. Images were subsequently normalized into Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). A separate general linear model (GLM) was defined for each subject that examined the neural response to PD game trials and Gamble trials. We defined two regressors: one spanning the entire length of each PD trial and another spanning the entire length of each Gamble trial. Each regressor was convolved with a standardized model of the hemodynamic response. The resulting general linear model was corrected for temporal autocorrelation using a first-order autoregressive model. For each subject, contrasts of parameter estimates between PD and Gamble trials were computed at every voxel of the brain. One-sample t-tests were used to identify voxels where the average contrast (PD–Gamble) for the whole group (n = 20 subjects) differed significantly from zero (i.e., a random effect analysis). The resulting map of the t statistic was thresholded at p b 0.005, with a spatial extent threshold of 5 contiguous voxels.  Functional connectivity analysis  The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) activation from the PD–Gamble contrast was defined as an ROI. The ROI was centered on the voxel of peak activity within DMPFC and included all activated voxels within 25 mm in the x, y and z directions. The time course within this ROI was extracted and standardized by removing the mean and normalizing by the standard deviation for each PD trial. Because the run consisted of Gamble trials interspersed with PD trials, PD time courses had to be isolated and spliced together to form a single non-interrupted time course that consisted of only PD trials. To accomplish this, we modeled the HRF response to PD trials and included only those volumes where the modeled HRF response was maximal. Whole brain EPI data were treated similarly, isolating and splicing together scans from PD trials. These spliced data were used for a new GLM in which the PD time course from the DMPFC ROI was included as the lone  Fig. 1. Payoff matrix used in PD game.

Each run consisted of 20 rounds of a simultaneous-choice, iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game randomly intermixed with 20 rounds of the Gamble task. Subjects were prepared to anticipate either PD or Gamble trials on each round of the game.  real human subjects (n = 19)  While in the scanner but prior to beginning each scanning run, subjects were shown a photograph of their alleged partner for the PD game in that run (actually a confederate). Subjects were told that they would play the game with their human partners, but in actuality they played against a computer strategy that was based on behavior of from our previous experiments (Rilling et al., 2002). That is, behavioral data from human subjects who played outside the scanner in a previous experiment were used to calculate the probability that a person would cooperate, as a function of the outcome of the previous two rounds of the game. A separate set of probabilities was calculated for the first and last 10 rounds, and the computer algorithm played according to these probabilities.  A timeline for a single trial is depicted in Fig. 2. On PD trials, the round number was displayed for 3s, after which subjects were shown a payoff matrix and had 6s to choose to cooperate or defect by pressing a button, which would highlight the column corresponding to their choice. This was followed 9s of a fixation cross before the partner's choice (i.e. trial outcome) was revealed and displayed for 6s. An additional 9s fixation separated the outcome from the next round.  Gamble trials began by displaying the round number for 3s. Afterwards, subjects were instructed to press one button to choose the $1 payoff or a different button to choose the risky option. They had 6s to make this choice. This was followed by 9s of a fixation cross, after which the payoff for that round was revealed and displayed for 6s. An additional 9s fixation separated the outcome from the next round. E-prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh) was used for stimulus presentation. Stimuli were projected onto a screen that subjects could view through a mirror mounted on the head coil. Subject responses were recorded using a response box. Each of the two runs lasted 22min.

This GLM identified voxels in which the time course of activation during the PD trials covaried with that of DMPFC. For each subject, beta values for this regressor were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis across the brain. One-sample t-tests were used to identify voxels where the average beta value for the whole group (n = 20 subjects) differed significantly from zero (i.e., a random effects analysis).The resulting map of the t statistic was thresholded at t N 7.0 (p b 10− 6), with a spatial extent threshold of 5 contiguous voxels. For comparison, a similar map of DMPFC connectivity was calculated for Gamble trials.  Granger causality analysis  The DMPFC ROI from the PD–Gamble contrast was selected as a reference region to map sources of influence to DMPFC and targets of influence from DMPFC across the brain. As defined by Granger Causality theory, a discrete time series X[t] is said to “Granger-cause” a discrete time series Y[t] if the past values of X improve the prediction of the current value of Y, given that all other sources of influence (at the very least Y's own past) have been taken into account (Roebroeck et al., 2005). Temporal information in the data is thus used to define the existence and direction of influence without the need to establish a model of assumed regional connectivity. The GCM plugin offered by Brain Voyager allows one to visualize difference causality maps, in which positive values indicate where influence from the reference region dominates and negative values indicate where influence to the reference region dominates.  The Granger Causality analysis was first conducted at the individual level to generate a t statistic image of the difference Granger Causality Map for each subject. For each individual granger map, bootstrapped p-values were subjected to an FDR-based correction at a q-level of 0.01 in order to correct for multiple comparisons. Individual maps are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. A group level analysis was then conducted by comparing the average of the individual t statistic maps with 0 using a one sample t statistic. The resulting group t statistic image was thresholded at p b 0.05, uncorrected for multiple comparisons (Fig. 5). A Granger analysis was conducted separately for PD and Gamble trials.  Experiment 2  Subjects  Thirty participants (15 females) from the Emory University  community were studied. Mean age was 21.2years (SD = 2.9).  Behavioral procedures  Prior to the day of the fMRI scan, subjects were asked to take a bogus personality test. The test included questions in which subjects were asked to estimate the frequency of various events (e.g., How many people travel through the Atlanta airport each day?). Whether or not answers to these questions are actually affected by personality is irrelevant to the experiment, as are the actual answers provided by subjects. When subjects arrived on the day of the experiment, they were assigned to either the red group or the black group, allegedly based on the answers they gave on the test, and were asked to wear a wristband of the respective color. In actuality, group assignment was determined by the order in which subjects were scanned, with the sequence alternating between red group and black group. Prior to entering the scanner, subjects met two confederates, one of whom was wearing a wristband of the same color and another who was wearing a wristband of a different color.

Although we included both male and female subjects, confederates were always of the same sex as the subject. It was not logistically possible to use the same two confederates for each scan, however all confederates were either undergraduate or graduate students from a similar age range (18–30years). Confederates were not necessarily of the same race as the subject. Subjects were told that their partners had also completed the personality survey and were classified as belonging to the red or black group based on their responses. Subjects were told that they would play 20 rounds of an iterated PD game with each of the two partners. The meeting between subjects and their partners consisted of a very brief introduction in which the two parties could greet one another but were not given the opportunity to engage in conversation.  As for Experiment 1, before meeting the confederates, all subjects completed a tutorial, quiz and practice trials. Finally, subjects were shown a chart depicting cumulative earnings of three fictitious subject pairs, one in which both individuals were from the red group, one in which both individuals were from the black group, and one in which one individual was from the red group and another from the black group. Subjects were told that no subject pair had yet earned the maximum amount possible. Given that group affiliation is often strongest in contexts involving competition between groups, this manipulation was included as an attempt to further differentiate feelings toward in-group and out-group partners.  J.K. Rilling et al. / NeuroImage 41 (2008) 1447–1461  1451  While being imaged with fMRI, subjects played twenty rounds of an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game in each of two sessions. The subject played with the in-group partner in one session and with the out-group partner in the other session. Prior to the start of each game, the visual display inside the scanner indicated with which partner the subject was about to play the game, as well as the group status of that partner (i.e., red group or black group). The order in which subjects faced in-group and out-group partners was counterbalanced across subjects. Subjects were told that they were playing with each of the two human partners they had met previously. However, in actuality, partner choices were administered by a computer algorithm that played a “forgiving tit for tat” strategy that defects in round 1, always reciprocates partner cooperation from the previous round, and reciprocates partner defection from the previous round 67% of the time. This forgiving aspect of the strategy helps to prevent long runs of mutual defection (Axelrod, 1984). Each trial began by showing the name of the partner and their group affiliation for 3s. Subjects were then shown a payoff matrix and had 6s to choose to cooperate or defect, which would highlight the column corresponding to their choice. Afterwards, subjects viewed a fixation cross for 9s before the partner's choice (i.e. trial outcome) was revealed and displayed for 6s. An additional 9s fixation separated the outcome from the next round. Each of the two runs lasted 11min.  At the end of the experiment, each subject was asked whether or not they felt different when interacting with the in-group vs. the out-group partner. The 12 subjects who answered in the affirmative were classified as “discriminators” for subsequent analyses, whereas the 18 who indicated that they did not feel different were classified as “non-discriminators”. Demographic characteristics of each subject are provided in Table 1. Male and female subjects were quite evenly distributed across discriminators and non-discriminators. The 12 discriminators included 5 females and 7 males, and the 18 non-discriminators included 10 females and 8 males.  fMRI image acquisition  Subjects lay motionless in a supine position in the scanner. Functional images were acquired on a Siemens 3T Trio scanner using an EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 22 ms, matrix = 64 × 64, FOV = 192 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm, gap = 1 mm, 32 axial slices. The duration of each of the two  Table 2 Activations for contrast PD–Gamble in Experiment 1  Brain region  EPI scans was 11min. These were followed by a 7min T1-weighted MPRAGE scan (TR = 2300 ms, TE = 4 ms, matrix = 256 × 256, slice thickness = 1.33 mm, gap = 0 mm).  fMRI image analysis  A separate general linear model (GLM) was defined for each subject that examined the neural response to in-group and outgroup runs in the PD game. We defined two regressors for each subject: one spanning the entire length of the run with the in-group partner and another spanning the entire length of the run with the out-group partner. Importantly, intensity values for each voxel of an image were normalized to the global mean for that image, so that regional activation relative to the global mean could be compared across sessions with in-group and out-group partners.  ROI analysis. For each of the putative theory-of-mind related activations from the PD–Gamble contrast in Experiment 1, an ROI was centered on the activation peak and included all activated voxels within 25 mm in the x, y and z directions. Within each of these ROIs, activation during the in-group run was contrasted with activation during the out-group run using the GLM specified above. Given that previous studies have reported differential activation in the amygdala and DLPFC when evaluating faces from racial in-groups vs. out-groups (Eberhardt, 2005), we additionally defined ROIs in these two structures. The DLPFC ROI was a 9 mm radius sphere centered on the peak activation coordinate reported in (Cunningham et al., 2004) for the contrast between viewing Black and White faces, and the amygdala ROI was drawn on one subject's Talairach transformed anatomical scan, with the aid of a reference atlas (Duvernoy, 1999).  To identify brain regions where connectivity with DMPFC was stronger for in-group than out-group partners, the time course within the DMPFC ROI from Experiment 1 was extracted and standardized by removing the mean and normalizing by the standard deviation for all in-group and out-group runs. In a new GLM, these in-group and out-group time courses were included as regressors and the contrast between them identified brain voxels with stronger DMPFC connectivity for in-group vs. out-group runs. For each subject, contrast values were calculated on a voxelby-voxel basis across the brain.

The resulting map of the r statistic was thresholded at r N 0.58 (p b 0.001), with a 5 voxel spatial extent threshold.  Emotion ratings  After each of the two games were completed while still in the scanner, subjects rated their emotional reaction to the four PD game outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD) using the button box. For Experiment 1, seven point Likert scales were used to rate the following emotions/feelings: angry, happy, irritated, guilty, camaraderie, trust, disappointment, and relieved. For Experiment 2, a larger number of emotions/feelings were rated: afraid, envious, angry, sad, happy, ashamed, irritated, contemptuous, jealous, guilty, camaraderie, trust, betrayed, indignant, disappointed, and relieved.  which time they were given the option to have their data deleted if they wished. None of our subjects chose to do so.  Results  Behavioral results  The difference in the number of times a subject cooperated with the in-group compared with the out-group partner (cooperation difference score) was calculated for each subject (Table 1). For the group as a whole, the average cooperation difference score (1.0) was not significantly different from zero (t(29) =1.28; p N 0.05). There was no significant difference in the cooperation difference score between self-reported “discriminators” (n= 12) and “non-discriminators” (n =18; t(28)= 0.30; p N 0.05; see Materials and methods). Nor was there a significant difference between male and female subjects (t(28) = 0.99; p N 0.05).  Post-scanning procedures and surveys  Imaging results  After being removed from the scanner, subjects provided an epithelial cell sample for subsequent genotyping analyses. In Experiment 1, subjects completed the NEO PI-R personality inventory (Costa and McCrae, 1992). In Experiment 2, subjects completed two widely used paper and pencil self-report psychopathy questionnaires (see Lilienfeld, 1998; Lilienfeld and Fowler, 2006). Results of analyses based on these questionnaires are published in a separate manuscript (Rilling et al., 2007). For both experiments, subjects completed a post-scan questionnaire that asked about strategies they employed and reactions they had to various game outcomes. Finally, all subjects were debriefed about study objectives as well as the deception used in the experiment, at  The contrast between PD trials and the non-social Gamble trials revealed activation in areas belonging to the default mode network (Table 2, Fig. 3a), including medial prefrontal and medial and lateral parietal cortices, as well as dorsolateral and rostrolateral prefrontal cortices. Although medial prefrontal activity associated with the default mode is often found both ventrally and dorsally, the medial prefrontal activation reported here had a predominantly dorsal focus, specifically in the region involved in theory-of-mind processing (Amodio and Frith, 2006). In addition to default mode areas, areas that have been linked with social cognition were activated, including bilateral anterior insula and left inferior frontal  Fig. 5.

Rilling et al. / NeuroImage 41 (2008) 1447–1461  cortex (Table 2). Deactivated areas corresponded closely with the “task-positive” network that is frequently activated during attention demanding cognitive tasks and is anticorrelated with the default mode network (Fox et al., 2005; Fransson, 2005, 2006).  To determine whether the activated regions were part of a functionally connected network that was active during the PD game, the DMPFC ROI from the contrast map was used as a seed in a functional connectivity analysis that was restricted to scans acquired during PD trials. There was widespread overlap between the resulting functional connectivity map and the contrast map (Table 3, Fig. 3b). For comparison, we also generated a map of DMPFC connectivity during the gamble task (Fig. 3c). This map looked similar to the PD DMPFC map, however the latter showed more widespread connectivity with medial parietal and hippocampal cortex (Supplementary Fig. 2).  The average time course of all activated areas from the contrast map combined, excluding visual cortical areas, is plotted in Fig. 4 where it can be seen that the difference between PD and Gamble tasks arises during the fixation period that follows the decisionmaking epoch. During this epoch, activation increases for PD trials and decreases for gamble trials, and the resulting difference in activation remains for the remainder of the trial. Visual cortical areas were excluded from the plot to diminish the potentially strong influence of the visual stimulation level on the time course response in a nonspecific manner. Separate time course plots for each of the activated regions that compose the contrast map showed that for all but two of the eleven ROIs, the difference between PD and Gamble trials arose in the fixation period following the decision-making epoch (Supplementary Fig. 3). For the medial parietal cortex, the difference arose during the decisionmaking epoch itself, whereas the difference did not arise until the outcome epoch for the left anterior insula.  A Granger causality analysis was performed to attempt to track the flow of information through this network. This analysis revealed that DMPFC activity during PD trials was influenced by activation in the anterior insula and other regions that correspond well with a previously described network hypothesized to be involved with emotional salience processing (Seeley et al., 2007) (Fig. 5a;  Supplementary Fig. 1). Additionally, DMPFC activity preceded and influenced activity in a group of regions that correspond well with the executive control network, including DLPFC and lateral parietal cortices (Seeley et al., 2007). As with the functional connectivity analysis, a Granger causality image of DMPFC connectivity during the Gamble task was similar to the corresponding image during the PD task, but with subtle and potentially interesting differences (Fig. 5b). In particular, anterior insula had greater influence over DMPFC activity during PD compared with Gamble trials.  To evaluate whether components of this network were more active when interacting with in-group compared to out-group partners, activated regions from the PD–Gamble contrast in Experiment 1 were defined as ROIs to be interrogated in Experiment 2. We specifically focused on default mode regions. Four default moderelated ROIs were defined from the contrast map in Fig. 3a: DMPFC, medial parietal cortex, right and left lateral parietal cortex (i.e., TPJ). Given that previous studies have reported differential activation in the amygdala and DLPFC when evaluating faces from racial ingroups vs. out-groups, we additionally defined ROIs in these two structures (Eberhardt, 2005).  In none of these ROIs did the BOLD response to interacting with in-group partners significantly differ from that to interacting with out-group partners. However, among the 12 self-reported “discriminators”, both right TPJ and DMPFC activation was stronger for in-group than out-group partners (paired t(11) = 2.42 and 2.56, respectively p b 0.05). No other ROI showed in-group–out-group differences among discriminators (Fig. 6). Among non-discriminators, right DLPFC activation was stronger for out-group than ingroup partners (t(17) = − 2.65, p b 0.05). No other ROI showed ingroup–out-group differences among non-discriminators (Fig. 6). Time courses for each of the ROIs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.  Another measure of subject responsiveness to the in-group–outgroup manipulation is the difference in the number of times a subject cooperated with in-group vs. out-group partners. To explore this variability, we tested for correlations across subjects between the extent to which they behaviorally discriminated  Fig. 6.

DMPFC was the only ROI exhibiting a positive correlation between the cooperation difference score and the difference in BOLD activation between in-group and out-group partners (r = 0.36, p b 0.05).  In addition to the above ROI analyses, the cooperation difference score was also used as a covariate in a whole brain, voxelby-voxel exploratory analysis of the in-group–out-group contrast. This analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between the cooperation difference score and activation in the right frontoinsular cortex (Fig. 7a, Table 4), such that subjects who defected more with out-group than in-group partners also activated this region more for out-group than in-group partners (Fig. 7b).  Finally, we were interested in whether functional connectivity with DMPFC differed for in-group and out-group partners. As for Experiment 1, DMPFC was functionally connected with medial parietal, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, and bilateral DLPFC, when in-group and out-group data were combined (Fig. 8).

Discussion  We have identified a network of functionally connected brain regions, including the default mode regions, that is more active when interacting with a human partner than when performing a non-social task that shares many of the same features. The default mode network or “task-negative” network has been implicated in intrinsic, self-oriented processes as opposed to extrinsic, world oriented processes (Golland et al., 2007, 2008; Gusnard et al., 2001). Within this network, activity increased during the fixation epoch that followed the choice epoch in the PD game (Fig. 4). Thus, as expected, activation of the default mode network increased during the trial epoch in which subjects were least engaged in the task. However, this only occurred in the PD task. As simulation theory would predict, this intrinsic, self-referential network is activated to a greater extent in a social task that involves making inferences about the mental states of others. The transient dip in activation following the revelation of the outcome in the PD task may reflect a brief interruption of intrinsic processing as the subject attends to the outcome, followed by a return to the intrinsic state shortly thereafter. In the Gamble task, there may not be sufficient time or motivation to transition from an extrinsic mode during the choice and outcome epochs into an intrinsic mode. That is, the need to engage in self-referential processing in order to understand the intentions of a social partner is absent from the gamble task.  The functional connectivity analysis showed marked similarity in the DMPFC connectivity network for PD and Gamble trials. However, despite this similarity, the magnitude of activation within the network is greater for the PD than the Gamble task (Figs. 3a and 4). The similarity in connectivity for the two tasks is not unexpected given that a previous study detected the default mode network both at rest and during a working memory task (Fransson, 2006). However, connectivity was attenuated in several regions during the working memory task, including medial parietal and parahippocampal cortex. Similarly, we found attenuated DMPFC connectivity with medial parietal and hippocampal cortex in the Gamble task relative to the PD task. Thus, during the PD game mentalizing may depend to a greater extent on structures involved in episodic memory retrieval (Buckner and Carroll, 2007; Cavanna and Trimble, 2006).  In addition to the default mode areas, the anterior insula was also part of the activated network. The anterior insula is involved in mapping physiological states of the body, including visceral sensations of autonomic arousal (Craig, 2002, 2003; Critchley, 2005).  1458  J.K. Rilling et al. / NeuroImage 41 (2008) 1447–1461  Fig. 8. Reproducibility of functional connectivity from DMPFC seed ROI. Results from Experiment 1 are in blue. Results from Experiment 2 are in orange.  The Granger causality analysis suggested that activity in the anterior insula as well as other regions in the emotional salience network preceded and caused the DMPFC activity during the PD Game. The influence of anterior insula on DMPFC activity in the Gamble task was attenuated compared with the PD task. Thus, autonomic arousal, in the context of a social interaction, may initiate an attempt to understand another person's mental state. Bilateral DLPFC was also part of the network, and the Granger analysis suggested that it followed and was caused by DMPFC activity. DLPFC is part of an executive control network (Seeley  et al., 2007). One possible interpretation of this result is that the attempt to understand another person's mental state is followed by an attempt to regulate one's emotional response to that inference and/or to use that knowledge in strategic decision-making. However, given that DLPFC is associated with many functions in addition to these, this interpretation should be considered speculative at this time.  All four of the default mode regions from our network have been implicated in theory-of-mind reasoning. These include the medial parietal cortex, bilateral lateral parietal cortex (or temporoparietal junction) and DMPFC (Mitchell et al., 2005, 2006; Saxe and Wexler, 2005). If the default mode is involved in simulating  Table 5 DMPFC connectivity with in-group – DMPFC connectivity with out-group  Brain region  BA  X  Y  Z  # voxels Peak t  47 11 11  Right inferior frontal gyrus 3.88 Right orbital gyrus 3.28 Right orbital gyrus 3.48 Right ventral striatum 4.85 Left orbital gyrus 4.34 Left cingulate gyrus -3.63 Left orbital gyrus 3.97 Left inferior frontal gyrus 3.29 Left inferior frontal gyrus 3.78 Left inferior temporal gyrus -3.44 Clusters of 5 or more voxels that survive a statistical threshold of p b 0.005 (t N 3.05).  11 32 10, 11 47 10 37  39 13 20 153 134 11 55 6 18 5  33 15 15 -21 -16 -3 -14 -30 -35 -47  29 55 20 15 11 3 44 32 46 -56  6 -2 -7 -9 -9 40 -3 -5 2 -16  Fig. 9.

Rilling et al. / NeuroImage 41 (2008) 1447–1461  1459  the mental perspective of others, we might expect it to be more active when the subject is interacting with an in-group partner who is like them and can therefore be more easily simulated, compared to an out-group partner (Mitchell et al., 2005). Looking at the subgroup of subjects who reported that the in-group–out-group manipulation was effective, this was true for two of the ROIs, DMPFC and right TPJ. In each of these ROIs, the BOLD signal increased during the fixation epoch that followed the decisionmaking epoch, after which the response to in-group partners was consistently above the response to out-group partners (Supplementary Fig. 4). Further evidence that the difference in DMPFC activation between in-group and out-group partners was more pronounced when the behavioral manipulation was more effective is provided by the positive correlation between the cooperation difference score (in-group–out-group) and the difference in DMPFC activation when playing with in-group vs. out-group partners. This was not true of right TPJ.  If DMPFC is involved in simulation, that is, understanding others through imagining our own thoughts, feelings or behaviors in a similar situation (Iacoboni et al., 2005), we would expect it to also be active when subjects are asked to reflect on their own thoughts and feelings. Indeed, this region of DMPFC is activated by tasks in which subjects indicate whether a picture makes them feel pleasant or unpleasant and when they report their own views on various personal and social issues (Gusnard et al., 2001; Mitchell et al., 2006). However, one investigation that explicitly tested simulation theory by asking people to reflect on the thoughts of similar and dissimilar others, found DMPFC to be more responsive to dissimilar compared with similar others; the exact opposite prediction of simulation theory (Mitchell et al., 2006). Yet, a slightly more ventral region of medial prefrontal cortex had the opposite response properties, in line with simulation theory. When we apply these two ROIs (10 mm cubes centered on the activation peaks in each region) to our data, there is no significant difference in the response to ingroup and out-group partners, for discriminators, non-discriminators or the group as a whole (p N 0.05). The explanation for the discrepancy between the DMPFC results reported here and those of Mitchell et al. is uncertain, however one factor to consider is the nature of the tasks used in the two experiments. In the present experiment, subjects are immersed in a dynamic social interaction in which they are likely to be continually updating predictions of their partner's future behavior based on partner feedback. On the other hand, in the study by Mitchell et al., subjects build a mental model of a person based on a written description and then use that information to estimate the subjects' views on a wide range of personal and social issues, without receiving behavioral feedback from the partner.  We also found that DMPFC exhibited stronger functional connectivity with OFC and ventral striatum when interacting with ingroup compared with out-group partners. Both the ventral striatum and OFC are involved in processing rewarding stimuli (O'Doherty, 2004). Thus, increased connectivity with these limbic regions could indicate stronger positive emotional influences for in-group interactions. Indeed, analysis of post-scan emotion ratings showed that subjects reported significantly higher levels of camaraderie in response to mutual cooperation with in-group compared with out-group partners (Two way, repeated measures F 1,26=12.6, pb 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 5). Among non-discriminators, DLPFC was more active when interacting with out-group than in-group partners. Previous studies have reported DLPFC activation when evaluating faces from racial out-groups, which has been interpreted as a neural correlate of cognitive effort to inhibit a prepotent discriminatory tendency  those subjects who exert more cognitive effort  (Eberhardt, 2005). Thus, our data could be interpreted to suggest that towards overcoming biases against out-group partners may be more successful at doing so, or at least more likely to report that they were successful.  Finally, a whole brain, voxel-by-voxel exploratory analysis revealed that subjects who defected more with out-group than ingroup partners also activated the frontoinsular cortex more for outgroup than in-group partners (Fig. 7b). Activation in this region has been observed in response to a variety of negative social interactions, from social exclusion in a cyberball task (Eisenberger et al., 2003), to receiving an unfair offer in an Ultimatum Game (Sanfey et al., 2003), to watching a loved one receive a painful stimulus (Singer et al., 2004). Thus, the correlation could indicate that subjects who defect more with out-group compared to in-group partners find their out-group interactions particularly aversive relative to their in-group interactions. However, insula activation could also be the cause rather than the effect of an aversive social interaction. Viewing pictures of out-groups that are both stereotypically hostile and stereotypically incompetent activates the anterior insula (Harris and Fiske, 2006), and the right anterior insula, in particular, is thought to be a site of interoceptive awareness that gives rise to subjective feeling states that may play a role in decisionmaking (Damasio, 1994). Thus, subjects with strong initial ingroup–out-group biases may activate anterior insula more when playing with out-group partners and this, in turn, may bias them to defect more often with out-group partners.  In summary, our social interactive task was associated with activation in a network of functionally connected brain regions. Several nodes in this network are components of the default mode network that typically deactivates to attention demanding tasks. The fact that these regions activate to an attention demanding social task suggests that the tonic, resting state activity in default mode regions may be involved in social cognition (Buckner and Carroll, 2007). This social cognitive neural network also included anterior insular cortex which appears to initiate engagement of the network. For subjects in whom the in-group–out–group manipulation was more effective, activation in DMPFC was stronger for in– group vs. out-group interactions, supporting the simulation theory of mentalizing. DMPFC also exhibited stronger connectivity with limbic, reward regions for in-group compared with out-group interactions, and subjects reported more camaraderie following CC outcomes in the former. On the other hand, subjects reporting that they did not discriminate showed stronger DLPFC activation during out-group interactions, suggesting that they may have been exerting cognitive effort to override discriminatory tendencies. Finally, subjects who behaviorally discriminated against out-group partners to a greater extent also showed stronger activation in the frontoinsular cortex during out-group interactions, implying that these interactions were particularly arousing and perhaps aversive. These differences in brain activity for in-group and out-group interactions are potential neural substrates for the human tendency to more readily identify with in-group members and more readily distrust, fear and discriminate against out-group members.

Deﬁcits in executive functioning are common in OCD and are thought to be related to dysfunctional frontalstriatal systems. One of those executive functions is cognitive ﬂexibility, deﬁned as the ability to rapidly switch response strategies following changes in task-relevant information. The temporal stability of cognitive ﬂexibility impairments in OCD has been incompletely investigated since previous studies have suggested both state and trait dependency. In this study, 16 OCD patients performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging version of a task-switching paradigm twice, intervened by a follow-up period of on average 6 months. Results show that functional abnormalities in the dorsal frontal-striatal circuit and anterior cingulate cortex at baseline normalized at follow-up. This change in the recruitment of task-related brain circuits correlated with change in disease severity. These results support the view that the imbalance between the dorsal and ventral frontal-striatal circuits is at least partly state-dependent, and is associated with a reduction in symptom severity.  & 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is, with a lifetime prevalence of around 2–3% (Ruscio et al., 2010), the fourth ranked psychiatric disorder (Fava and Kendler, 2000; El-Sayegh et al., 2003). OCD is characterized by recurrent, intrusive and persistent thoughts (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors (compulsions) which patients need to perform in order to reduce the concomitant anxiety or distress (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). These patients therefore suffer from a metaphorical itch that is not alleviated until it is scratched, while in the long run scratching enhances the itch. The disorder has a detrimental impact on daily life functioning and frequently runs a chronic, relapsing/ remitting course (Fenske and Schwenk, 2009).  Apart from the time-consuming obsessions and/or compulsions, OCD patients also show cognitive symptoms. Neuropsychological tests have revealed deﬁcits in spatial working memory, spatial recognition, and motor initiation and execution in OCD (Purcell et al., 1998). In recent years, these tests have been combined with  n Corresponding author at: Department of Psychiatry. VU University Medical  Center, PO BOX 7057, 1007 MB Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

It is thought that dysfunction of the dorsal frontal-striatal circuit underlies the executive deﬁcits in OCD patients (Remijnse et al., 2005; Friedlander and Desrocher, 2006; de Wit et al., 2012). Frontalstriatal circuits interconnect prefrontal areas with the basal ganglia and limbic areas and are, among others, involved in executive functioning, motor initiation and control, and emotion processing (Cummings, 1993; Remijnse et al., 2005; Menzies et al., 2008; van den Heuvel et al., 2010). These circuits have been implicated in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric disorders (Phillips, 2003; Phillips et al., 2003a,b; van den Heuvel et al., 2010), including OCD (Remijnse et al., 2005; Mataix-Cols and van den Heuvel, 2006; van den Heuvel et al., 2009). The dorsal ‘executive’ frontal-striatal circuit encompasses the dorsal areas of the prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the dorsal part of the caudate nucleus (Mataix-Cols and van den Heuvel, 2006). The ventral ‘affective’ circuit consists of the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral subcortical areas, such as the ventral striatum (Friedlander and Desrocher, 2006; Mataix-Cols and van den Heuvel, 2006). A current model of OCD pathophysiology postulates that key aspects of OCD, i.e. compulsive behavior and persistent focus on certain aspects of the environment (e.g. danger or hygiene) (Friedlander and Desrocher, 2006; Fibbe et al., 2012), may result  32  C. Vriend et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 213 (2013) 31–38  from an imbalance between a hyperactive ventral and a hypoactive dorsal circuit. Additional support for an imbalance between dorsal and ventral circuits in OCD comes from two recent resting-state studies that showed increased and reduced functional coupling in, respectively, the ventral (Harrison et al., 2009; Sakai et al., 2011) and dorsal circuit (Harrison et al., 2009) in patients with OCD compared with healthy controls. Although this model is overly simplistic, for instance due to the clinical heterogeneity of OCD and lack of speciﬁcity among disorders (Mataix-Cols and van den Heuvel, 2006), it provides a useful framework for investigating the complex interactions between emotional and cognitive processes underlying OCD symptoms.  The dorsal  frontal-striatal circuit  is involved in cognitive ﬂexibility, i.e. the ability to rapidly change response strategies with alterations in task-relevant information in the environment (Fineberg et al., 2010). Cognitive ﬂexibility is impaired in OCD and related disorders (Friedlander and Desrocher, 2006; Chamberlain and Menzies, 2009), which has frequently been associated with dysfunction of the dorsal frontal-striatal circuit (Remijnse et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2008; Woolley et al., 2008; Page et al., 2009). Abnormal cognitive ﬂexibility in OCD patients probably relates to their tendency to perseverate and their inability to engage in new behaviors. Cognitive ﬂexibility can be investigated with different paradigms, e.g. the reversal learning task and the switch task paradigm. In the reversal learning task, subjects have to alter their responses with changing stimulus-reinforcement contingencies, i.e. punishment and reward (Remijnse et al., 2006). The switch task has two separate task instructions which are introduced by a certain cue. After several trials the cue changes and subjects have to switch their behavior accordingly. An advantage of the taskswitching paradigm over the reversal learning task is that it is not biased by contingency learning (Robbins, 2007); i.e. subjects do not receive feedback on their responses and successful switches are therefore generated internally rather than triggered by external cues. A previous study by our group (Remijnse et al., 2012) showed that OCD patients had more accurate but slower performance than the control group, although switch cost (i.e. RT switch events minus RT repeat events) did not signiﬁcantly differ between OCD patients (n¼19) and controls (n¼29). This latter ﬁnding is in line with other studies (Gu et al., 2008; Woolley et al., 2008; Page et al., 2009). Interestingly, in the OCD group accuracy increased linearly with the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Imaging results of that study showed that OCD patients had lower taskrelated activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex during switching and increased recruitment of the dorsal ACC and putamen compared with healthy controls. Activation of the dorsal ACC and putamen correlated positively with disease severity (Remijnse et al., 2012). Furthermore, in contrast to controls, OCD subjects showed no switch-related activity in the DLPFC, an integral part of the dorsal frontal-striatal circuit. The correlation between performance accuracy and disease severity suggests that altered switching capability in OCD is state dependent. However, its stability over time has only rarely been investigated. A recent preliminary study of Han et al. (2011) on cognitive ﬂexibility in 10 OCD patients showed overall normalization of ventral frontal-striatal activity at 16-week follow-up with changes in task-related thalamic activity positively correlating with symptom improvement. Dorsal frontalstriatal dysfunction was found to persist. In contrast, in a comparison of the neural correlates of a planning task in pediatric OCD patients before and after 16 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, (Huyser et al., 2010) showed normalized activity in the DLPFC after successful treatment, suggesting state-dependency.  In the present study, we aimed to further investigate these above-mentioned questions regarding the state-dependency of dorsal and ventral frontal-striatal dysfunction in OCD. To this end, we obtained fMRI data from 18 OCD patients using a naturalistic  longitudinal approach. Based on the above-reviewed literature and theoretical models, we hypothesized that a decrease in disease severity would result in normalization of task performance and taskrelated recruitment of the dorsal frontal-striatal circuit and the ACC.  2. Methods  2.1. Subjects  Eighteen medication-free subjects diagnosed with OCD were included in this study, in follow-up of a previous study (Remijnse et al., 2012). We adopted a naturalistic follow-up design since subjects were recruited from various sources (psychiatric outpatient clinics in Amsterdam and Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and by online advertisements), hampering controlled treatment conditions. At follow-up, diagnoses of OCD and any comorbid disorders (see Table 1) were established by an experienced clinician (PR, co-author), with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I disorders (SCID-I) (First et al., 2002). Exclusion criteria were the presence of alcohol or substance abuse, or major medical or neurological disorders. Participants were free from psychotropic medication for at least 2 weeks before the ﬁrst scanning session, while medication was allowed during the second session. All participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the ethical review board of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  2.2. Questionnaires  To assess obsessive-compulsive symptom characteristics and severity, we administered the Padua Inventory-Revised (Padua-IR) (Sanavio, 1988) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (Goodman et al., 1989), respectively. To rate the presence and severity of depressive symptoms the Montgomery– ˚Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (Montgomery and ˚Asberg, 1979) was used. All questionnaires were administered at T0 (baseline session) and T1 (follow-up).  2.3. Task-switching paradigm  Subjects performed a self-paced task-switching (letter/digit) paradigm during fMRI scanning. Subjects were presented with a letter (a, e, i, u, b, c, d, f) and a digit (2, 4, 6, 8, 3, 5, 7, 9) displayed on a colored background for a maximum of 4 s. A blue background indicated that subjects had to respond to the letter (discriminate vowel or consonant), while a red background cued a digit discrimination (i.e. odd or even). Responses were given with the right index ﬁnger on an MRIcompatible button box. Two consecutive trials never contained the same letter or digit. Task switching occurred randomly after four to six trials to avoid predictability. The ﬁrst trial immediately after task switching was deﬁned as a ‘switch event’ (SE); all other trials were ‘repeat events’ (RE) (see Fig. 1). The task ended after 32 discrimination stages, i.e. after 31 task switches. E-prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Sharpsburg, PA, US) was used for the task presentation and recording of behavioral data (reaction times and accuracy).

Vriend et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 213 (2013) 31–38  33  2.4.  Imaging  Imaging data were collected using a Sonata 1.5-T MRI system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard circularly polarized head coil. Task stimuli were generated by a Pentium PC and projected on a screen behind the subject’s head at the end of the scanner table, visible through a mirror mounted on the head coil. The subject’s head was immobilized using foam pads to reduce motion artifacts.  T2*-weighted echo-planar images (EPI’s) with blood oxygenation leveldependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired in each session; repetition time (TR)¼2180 ms, echo time (TE)¼45 ms, 35 slices (3  3 mm in-plane resolution; 2.5 mm slice thickness; matrix size 64  64) per choplanar image (EPI) volume. The ﬁrst two EPI’s (dummy scans) of each scanning-session were automatically discarded by the scanner before the task started. Structural images were acquired using a 3D coronal T1-weighted sequence (TR¼2700 ms, TE¼4 ms, TI¼950 ms, voxel size 1  1  1.5 mm, 160 coronal slices).  All imaging analyses were performed in the context of the generalized linear model. At ﬁrst-level (per subject) the onsets of all accurate SE’s were modeled using delta functions convolved with the hemodynamic response function. Subjects’ movement parameters were implemented in the model as regressors of no interest. A high-pass ﬁlter (128-s cut-off period) was used to remove noise associated with low-frequency confounds. Contrast images containing parameter estimates for successful switch minus implicit baseline (IB, including all RE’s) as well as for the change in brain activity between T0 and T1 during switching ((SE IB)T1 versus (SE IB)T0) were entered in second-level (random effects) analyses. The contrast T04T1, masked by the main effect of T0 (at Po0.05) shows brain activity decreases, while the T14T0 contrast masked by the main effect of T1 (at Po0.05) indicates increases in brain activity from T0 to T1. Additionally, changes in disease severity were added as a covariate to assess changes in BOLD activity between T0 and T1 related to changes in clinical status. All ﬁndings are reported at Po0.001, uncorrected.  2.5. Data analysis  Demographic and behavioral data from T0 and T1 were analyzed using SPSS software (v15, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill., US). Changes over time in disease severity (measured by both Y-BOCS and PADUA-IR) and task performance (i.e. mean RT [in ms] on accurate SE and RE) were analyzed with t-tests. Switch costs (deﬁned as RT on SE events minus RT on RE) and error rates (in %) did not comply with the assumptions of parametric tests and were analyzed with the Wilcoxon-signed rank test. Pearson’s correlations were calculated for the changes in task performance measures and changes in disease severity. Statistical threshold was set at Po0.05, two-sided.  Imaging analysis was performed with SPM8 software (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK). Images were reoriented and realigned to the ﬁrst volume. The resulting mean image was then co-registered to the structural T1 image, and images were normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and spatially smoothed using a 6 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.  3. Results  3.1. Demographic data  Data from two subjects were excluded from the analyses, due to technical difﬁculties and non-compliance with the task instructions, respectively. Sample characteristics are provided in Table 1. In Table 2, clinical characteristics at T0 and T1 are presented, showing that subjects signiﬁcantly improved on the Y-BOCS between T0 and T1 (t(15)¼3.95, P¼0.001). There were no signiﬁcant changes on the MADRS and PADUA-IR.  3.2. Behavioral data  On average, subjects responded signiﬁcantly faster at T1 compared with T0 during RE (t(15)¼2.244, P¼0.040) and SE (t(15)¼  2.536, P¼0.023). There was no decrease in switch cost or change in the error rate during the RE (see Table 2) between the sessions, although a trend was observed for the error rate during the SE (z¼  1.912, P¼0.056). Unlike the results of our previous study (r¼  0.55, P¼0.02; Remijnse et al., 2012), at T1 there was no signiﬁcant correlation between the Y-BOCS score and error rate during the SE (r¼  0.303, P¼0.254). Lastly, there was no correlation between the change in disease severity and change in reaction time on SE (r¼0.168, P¼0.535), RE (r¼0.329, P¼0.213) or changes in switch cost (r¼  0.024, P¼0.931).  3.3.  Imaging data: Effects of time  Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the task-switching paradigm. Task instructions were inferred by the color of the background. Blue signaled a judgment based on the letter and red a judgment based on the digit. Background color and task instruction switched every 4–6 trials. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)  Main effects of the switch task (i.e. SE4IB contrast) at T0 and T1 were mainly found in the bilateral putamen, the left inferior parietal lobe and the right premotor area (see Table 3). Compared with T0, at T1 patients showed less task-related activity in the left putamen, the right dorsal ACC and the right premotor area.

There was no increase of task-related activity at T1. To assess that these results were not affected by variable length of T0–T1 between subjects, or to changes in task performance or disease severity we added the interval length, changes in switch cost and Y-BOCS as additional nuisance covariates to the analysis. This, however, did not signiﬁcantly alter the results (data not shown).  3.4.  Imaging data: Correlation with change in disease severity  Correlation analysis between the BOLD response and change in disease severity revealed a positive correlation between taskrelated activation in the left dorsal ACC (r¼0.770, Po0.001) and change in disease severity, reﬂecting increased activity with increasing disease severity (see Fig. 2a and b). Negative correlations (increased activity with reduction in disease severity) were most notable for the left DLPFC (r¼  0.811, Po0.001) (see Fig. 2c and d) and the right thalamus (r¼  0.823, Po0.001) (see Fig. 2e and f), but also found in other areas such as the anterior PFC and right DLPFC (see Table 4). Adding interval length and changes in switch cost as additional nuisance covariates to the correlation analysis did not signiﬁcantly alter these results (data not shown).  3.5. Post-hoc analysis: Responders versus non-responders  A greater than 30% decrease in Y-BOCS score is indicative of signiﬁcant clinical improvement (Tolin et al., 2005). Six subjects (henceforth responders) met this criterion. Four received cognitive behavioral therapy; one received medication (ﬂuoxetine 20 mg) and from one patient data on treatment characteristics was missing. We found no signiﬁcant differences between responders and non-responders on age, follow-up period, gender, handedness and education (all P40.1). There were no signiﬁcant differences on the initial Y-BOCS score (T0) and MADRS at T0 or T1. However, there was a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups on the Y-BOCS at T1 (responders M¼10.67 S.D.¼6.41, nonresponders M¼19.80 S.D.¼4.29; t(14)¼3.436, P¼0.004) and on the Padua-IR at both T0 (responders M¼32.50 S.D.¼19.81 nonresponders M¼64.20 S.D.¼21.06; t(12)¼2.602, P¼0.023) and T1 (responders M¼35.40 S.D.¼21.69 non-responders M¼67.10 S.D.¼19.81; t(13)¼2.836, P¼0.014). We observed a trend signiﬁcant difference of the RT (t(14)¼2.014, P¼0.064) and error percentage on the RE’s (U¼12.0, n1¼10, n2¼6, P¼0.051) during T0 in favor of the responders. There were no other signiﬁcant differences in performance. Responders showed signiﬁcantly increased task-related activation of the left dorsomedial PFC and  the right thalamus at T1, compared with T0, relative to nonresponders. Non-responders exhibited increased activation of the left orbitofrontal cortex and left putamen at T1 compared with T0 (see Table 5).  4. Discussion  The aim of the present study was to investigate the temporal stability of impaired cognitive ﬂexibility in OCD in order to understand whether this executive dysfunction and related brain activation pattern are trait or state characteristics of the disorder. Using a naturalistic follow-up design, at follow-up we observed improved speed and lowered accuracy during switch task performance and a decrease in disease severity, although these were not correlated. Furthermore, at the neural level changes in disease severity speciﬁcally correlated with increased task-related activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and thalamus, and decreased activity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).  At follow-up OCD patients showed signiﬁcant decrease in disease severity and performed signiﬁcantly faster during both switch and repeat trials. Switch cost (measure of switch ability) was comparable between sessions, although a trend-signiﬁcant increase in error rate on the SE’s was present. A previous study by our group using the same task paradigm showed that OCD subjects made slightly less errors on the switch trials than healthy controls and that this accuracy came at the expense of slower responses (Remijnse et al., 2012). Furthermore, in our previous study the error rate on SE’s correlated with the Y-BOCS score (i.e. higher accuracy with increasing disease severity). This ﬁnding ﬁts with the tendency towards perfectionism in OCD patients (Frost and Steketee, 1997), which may be related to increased error sensitivity and hyperactivity of the ACC (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005; Endrass et al., 2010; Stern et al., 2011). The observed decrease in accuracy in our study might therefore be explained as a normalization of the error monitoring system. However, we were unable to observe a signiﬁcant correlation between changes in disease severity and task performance.  Imaging results showed that task-related activity in the putamen and the premotor cortex was diminished at follow-up, which may represent a decrease in cognitive effort related to performing the task for the second time. Symptom reduction at follow-up, on the other hand, was speciﬁcally related to increased activity in the anterior PFC, DLPFC and thalamus during task switching, regardless of the duration of the follow-up period and changes in switch  C.

The anterior PFC is crucial for the integration of several separate cognitive operations in pursuit of a higher behavioral goal (Ramnani and Owen, 2004). The result of increasing taskrelated recruitment of the anterior PFC with decreasing disease severity in the present study is in line with the ﬁndings of decreased recruitment of the anterior PFC in OCD patients compared with healthy controls, most notably in the most severe OCD patients, in the previous study (Remijnse et al., 2012). The DLPFC plays a important role in executive functions (Ramnani and Owen, 2004). Decreased recruitment of the DLPFC and the interconnected brain regions of the dorsal frontal-striatal circuit has been found during various cognitive tasks in OCD (van den Heuvel  et al., 2005; Gu et al., 2008; Abramowitz et al., 2009) and this circuit is likely to be crucially involved in the pathophysiology of OCD (Remijnse et al., 2005; Mataix-Cols and van den Heuvel, 2006; van den Heuvel et al., 2009). Our result of state-dependent effects on DLPFC activity during executive functioning in OCD patients provides further empirical evidence for this. Another key structure in the frontal-striatal circuits is the thalamus. Our results revealed that an increase of thalamic activity correlates with a reduction in disease severity, suggesting restored recruitment of the thalamus following symptom improvement. An alternative explanation, however, is that the observed increase in thalamic activity at T1 is caused by normalization of the  36  C.

Since the present paradigm did not incorporate a separate baseline condition, this hypothesis remains untested.  We also observed decreased task-related activity of the ACC at T1 which correlated with a reduction in disease severity. The ACC is involved in performance and error monitoring and regulates both cognitive and emotional processing (Bush et al., 2000). Numerous studies (Ursu et al., 2003; Maltby et al., 2005; van den Heuvel et al., 2005; Viard et al., 2005; Huyser et al., 2010) have shown hyperactivation of this region in OCD patients during cognitive tasks. Our results showed attenuation of task-related activity of the ACC at T1 together with normalization of task performance (increased speed and decreased accuracy). Although we did not observe a direct correlation between behavioral changes and change in ACC activity, this might suggest a decrease in error-sensitivity upon symptom improvement. A recent study, however, showed that the heightened error monitoring was only partially affected by cognitive behavioral therapy in a sample of pediatric OCD patients (Huyser et al., 2011). Inconsistency between ﬁndings may be explained by differences in sample (pediatric versus adult) or task paradigm (interference versus switch).  Our post-hoc analysis of responders versus non-responders showed increased recruitment of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and thalamus at follow-up in responders. Conversely, non-responder showed increased recruitment of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and putamen. These results ﬁt with our previous ﬁndings of a positive correlation between activity in the putamen and disease severity in OCD patients (Remijnse et al., 2012) and the growing body of evidence suggesting hyperactivity of the OFC in OCD (Chamberlain et al., 2008). Unlike previous studies, in the present study activity in the OFC did not correlate with disease severity.  Taken together, our results are in line with the neurobiological model of OCD, suggesting an imbalance between a hyperactive ventral frontal-striatal system and a hypoactive dorsal frontalstriatal system (Mataix-Cols and van den Heuvel, 2006). Our  ﬁndings suggest that the observed dysfunction of the dorsal frontal-striatal system is state-dependent, since it normalizes on symptom reduction. Since OCD is often considered a chronic disorder with high rates of relapse (Fenske and Schwenk, 2009), it is possible that the observed normalization of neural activation is temporary and returns to its dysfunctional ‘state’ when the patient relapses. More extensive follow-up studies are needed to investigate this hypothesis.  Our results are only partially in agreement with those of Han et al. (2011) who showed normalization of activity in the ventral frontal-striatal circuit but sustained dysfunction in the dorsal frontal-striatal system. Differences may be attributed to methodological disparities (e.g., ﬁxed effects instead of random effects analyses), a shorter follow-up period in the study of Han et al., age differences (mean age of 23 yrs versus 30 yrs) and gender ratio (mostly males in Han and colleagues, mostly females in the present study). In addition, the 16-week follow-up in Han et al.’s sample resulted in only a marginally signiﬁcant reduction in Y-BOCS score (t¼2.23 P¼0.05). Another possibility is that the higher cognitive load of our switch task (color/shape naming versus letter/digit discrimination) put higher demands on the dorsal frontal-striatal circuit.  The present study was not without limitations. Our study utilized a naturalistic, rather than a controlled follow-up design and did not assign our subjects to a certain therapeutic (pharmacological or behavioral) or waiting list condition. We also included OCD patients with comorbid depressive symptoms. However, since MADRS scores did not critically change between T0 and T1 nor differed between responders and non-responders, it is unlikely that the observed changes in activation patterns can be explained by comorbid depression. Lastly, we implemented a rapid eventrelated design without null events or baseline condition conform the study of (Sohn et al., 2000) to prevent additional (confounding) switches between the task and baseline condition. This, however, precluded the direct comparison of BOLD response during SE and RE.  C. Vriend et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 213 (2013) 31–38  37  Exploration of additional contrasts (e.g., accurate SE4accurate RE and ﬁrst SE4third RE) showed, however, similar results.  In conclusion, this study examined the temporal stability of brain activation patterns related to cognitive ﬂexibility in OCD using a longitudinal naturalistic follow-up design. Our results showed that the dysfunction in the dorsal frontal-striatal circuit is at least partly state-dependent. Although our results need to be replicated by future controlled studies, this study suggests that OCD symptom reduction is associated with increased recruitment of the dorsal frontal-striatal circuits, and beneﬁts cognitive performance.

This task requires sufﬁciently similar cognitive schemas or psychological perspectives that act as ﬁlters to guide the selection, interpretation and storage of sensory information, perceptual objects and events. Here we show that when individuals adopt a similar psychological perspective during natural viewing, their brain activity becomes synchronized in speciﬁc brain regions. We measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from 33 healthy participants who viewed a 10-min movie twice, assuming once a ‘social’ (detective) and once a ‘non-social’ (interior decorator) perspective to the movie events. Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient was used to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity measures (inter-subject correlations; ISCs) of functional MRI data. We used k-nearest-neighbor and support vector machine classiﬁers as well as a Mantel test on the ISC matrices to reveal brain areas wherein ISC predicted the participants' current perspective. ISC was stronger in several brain regions—most robustly in the parahippocampal gyrus, posterior parietal cortex and lateral occipital cortex—when the participants viewed the movie with similar rather than different perspectives. Synchronization was not explained by differences in visual sampling of the movies, as estimated by eye gaze. We propose that synchronous brain activity across individuals adopting similar psychological perspectives could be an important neural mechanism supporting shared understanding of the environment.  © 2014 The Authors.

Introduction  Shared understanding between people requires a certain degree of similarity in perception and interpretation of external events, both related to social situations and to physical environment. Top-down cognitive processing modes or psychological perspectives adopted toward external events greatly inﬂuence how we interpret the world (Moll and Meltzoff, 2011). For example, a referee calling a last-minute penalty kick in the Champions League ﬁnal may be perceived as unfair and incompetent by supporters of the penalized team, while the supporters of the opposing team will praise the referee's accurate reading of the game (see, e.g., Hastorf and Cantril, 1954). In behavioral studies, sharing psychological perspectives enhances the similarity of interpretation of simple visual scenes (Kaakinen et al., 2011) and recall of expository  ⁎ Corresponding author at: P.O. Box 12200, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland.  E-mail address: juha.lahnakoski@aalto.ﬁ (J.M. Lahnakoski).  text (Kaakinen et al., 2002, 2003) across individuals. However, the neural mechanisms supporting shared psychological perspectives across individuals have remained poorly speciﬁed.  Psychological perspective-taking involves building an internal model or schema, which helps to select task-relevant objects and events from the external world, thereby aiding the interpretation of the experienced events and the selection of appropriate actions. Accordingly, the interpretation of a scene and the corresponding brain activity go hand-in-hand. For example, activity in the fusiform face area is stronger when the ambiguous Rubin's vase–face illusion is perceived as opposing faces rather than a vase (Andrews et al., 2002; Hasson et al., 2001). Moreover, directing attention to speciﬁc objects in dynamic visual scenes shapes both brain responses to those objects and the related semantic categories (Çukur et al., 2013). Similar mechanisms may underlie directing of attention to task-relevant sensory information during psychological perspective taking. However, it remains unclear to what extent the shifts in sensitivity to various objects and features in the incoming sensory streams are shared among individuals during perception of naturalistic scenes.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.022 1053-8119/© 2014 The Authors.

Lahnakoski et al. / NeuroImage 100 (2014) 316–324  317  During prolonged naturalistic stimulation, such as movie viewing, brain activity becomes synchronized across individuals in the time scale of a few seconds, both in early sensory cortices and in brain areas involved in higher-order vision and attention (Hasson et al., 2004; Jääskeläinen et al., 2008; Malinen et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2008). Such brain-region speciﬁc inter-subject synchronization of hemodynamic activity could be an important neural mechanism that supports sharing of psychological perspectives with others, as it may reﬂect the similarity of information processing across individuals. Recent evidence supports this notion by showing that mental action simulation increases the across-participants synchrony of brain activity in the action–observation network (Nummenmaa et al., 2014).  In the present study, we directly tested the hypothesis that sharing a psychological perspective with others enhances synchronization of brain activity across subjects, and that the degree of brain synchronization between two individuals could be used to predict the perspective they are taking. Participants viewed a 10-min movie segment twice, assuming a different psychological perspective on the two runs. We replicated the results in two experiments using independent subject populations and different functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanners. We show that inter-subject synchronization of brain activity, particularly in the lateral occipital cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and posterior parietal cortex, allows classifying whether two participants viewed the movie from the same or different perspectives. The results thus suggest that synchronous brain activation across individuals supports shared understanding of the environment.  Material and methods  Participants  The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki–Uusimaa, and each subject signed an ethics-committee-approved informed consent form prior to participation. In Experiment 1 twenty healthy volunteers (13 males, 7 females; 3 lefthanded; mean age 27 years, range 21–38) participated in the experiment. One additional participant was scanned but the data were removed from the analysis due to excessive head motion (relative displacement N voxel size) during fMRI scanning. Eye-movements were recorded in a separate  session outside of the scanner from independent subjects. To control for potential differences in viewing behavior inside vs. outside of the fMRI scanner and to be able to directly model the effects of subject-speciﬁc eye movements on brain activation, we ran Experiment 2 with 13 additional subjects (8 females; 1 left-handed; mean age 27 years, range 22–34) whose eye gaze was tracked during the fMRI. One additional subject was scanned but was excluded from the analyses due to misunderstanding of the instructions. None of the participants reported a history of neurological or psychiatric disease and they were not currently taking medication affecting the central nervous system.  Experimental design  The participants watched the ﬁrst 10 min of an episode of the television series Desperate Housewives (Season 1, Episode 15, Cherry Alley Productions, 2005; original English soundtrack with no subtitles) twice during fMRI. All participants of the two experiments were ﬂuent in English and understood the dialog without subtitles. In the fMRI experiment, the stimuli were delivered using the Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., Albany, California, USA). The video was back-projected on a semitransparent screen using a 3-micromirror data projector (Christie X3, Christie Digital Systems Ltd., Mönchengladbach, Germany), and from there via a mirror to the subject. In Experiment 2 the setup was otherwise similar except that the projector was replaced by a Panasonic PT-DZ110X projector (Panasonic Corporation, Osaka, Japan). Auditory stimulation was delivered using the UNIDES ADU2a audio system (Unides Design, Helsinki, Finland) via plastic tubes through porous EAR-tip (Etymotic Research, ER3, IL, USA) earplugs. For the last 10 subjects of Experiment 2, the auditory stimuli were delivered through Sensimetrics S14 insert earphones (Sensimetrics Corporation, Malden, Massachusetts, USA) due to equipment update at the imaging site. Sound intensity was adjusted individually to be comfortable but loud enough to be heard over the scanner noise.  Prior to watching the episode, the participants were given written instructions regarding the psychological perspective they should adopt while watching the movie for the ﬁrst time (see Fig. 1A). Initially, half of the subjects were instructed to assume a ‘social’ perspective of a forensic detective whose task was to solve which one of the persons appearing in the movie was the murderer. In contrast, the other half  Fig. 1. Experimental design and analyses. A: Participants watched the same movie clip twice, once from the detective and another time from the interior decorator perspective, with the starting perspective counterbalanced across participants. B: Mantel test was used to compare the pairwise ISC values (upper triangle entries) to a correlation matrix template (lower triangle entries) where ISC in same-perspective pairs (red) was higher than different-perspective pairs (blue). C: Subjects were classiﬁed according to the labels of the training subjects (detective — red, decorator — blue) with whom their ISC was highest. Proximity between two dots reﬂects the strength of the ISC between those subjects. The nearest three neighbors are indexed according to their proximity to the current subject, and the links are highlighted with the color corresponding to their class. For k = 3 the current subject (white dot) would be classiﬁed as a detective because two of the three nearest neighbors (neighbors 2 and 3) are detectives.  318  J.M. Lahnakoski et al. / NeuroImage 100 (2014) 316–324  of the subjects was instructed to assume a ‘non-social’ perspective of an interior decorator whose task was to redesign the interiors and exteriors seen in the episode (see the Appendix for the full instruction). All participants were encouraged to view the movie according to their designated perspective, and the instructions emphasized that after the experiment the subjects would need to respond to questions related to their task. The initial perspective-taking instructions were shown for 30 s at the beginning of the scanning session. After the episode ended, the participants were instructed to switch their perspective: those who initially assumed the role of a detective were now to assume the role of a decorator and vice versa. Finally, the participants watched the movie again from this new perspective. Thus, the total task lasted for 20 min. To disentangle the effects of the perspective-taking task from differences between subject groups, we collapsed the ﬁrst and the second viewing in the analysis. After the fMRI session, the participants completed a form that measured the success of perspective taking and perspective taking behavior during the two perspectives.  fMRI acquisition and preprocessing  MR imaging was performed at the Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Centre at Aalto University. In Experiment 1, the data were acquired with a General Electric Signa 3-Tesla MRI scanner (GE Healthcare Ltd., Chalfront St Giles, UK) with Excite upgrade using a 16-channel receiving head coil (MR Instruments Inc., MN, USA). Anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted sequence (Spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence, preparation time 300 ms, TR 10 ms, TE 4.6 ms, ﬂip angle 15°, scan time 313 s, 1 mm3 resolution). Wholebrain functional data were acquired with T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence, sensitive to the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal contrast (TR 2000 ms, TE 32 ms, ﬂip angle 90°, FOV 220 mm, 64 × 64 matrix, 4.0-mm slice thickness with 1-mm gap between slices, 29 interleaved oblique slices acquired in ascending order covering the whole brain).  In Experiment 2, the brain-imaging data were acquired with a 3 T Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), using a standard 20-channel receiving head-neck coil. Anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted MPRAGE pulse sequence (TR 2530 ms, TE 3.3 ms, TI 1100 ms, ﬂip angle 7°, 256 × 256 matrix, 176 sagittal slices, 1-mm3 resolution). Whole-brain functional data were acquired with T2*-weighted EPI sequence sensitive to the BOLD contrast. Imaging parameters for the functional images were similar to those in Experiment 1 with the exception that there were no gaps between the slices and that 32–36 slices were collected to ensure wholebrain coverage. A total of 660 images were acquired in both experiments. The ﬁrst 13 volumes were discarded to allow for equilibration of the magnetization and to exclude brain activity recorded during the time when the subjects were reading the instructions for the upcoming task.  Standard preprocessing steps were applied to the data using the FSL software (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk): The EPI images were realigned to the middle scan by rigid body transformations to correct for head movements. EPI and structural images were co-registered and normalized to the T1 standard template in MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) — International Consortium for Brain mapping) using linear transformations with 9 degrees of freedom, high-pass ﬁltered with a cut-off frequency of 0.01 Hz, and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8-mm FWHM.  Self-reports  After the fMRI experiment, the participants of the fMRI experiment completed a questionnaire regarding their perspective-taking behavior. Using a 5-point Likert scale they rated (i) how easy it was to adopt each perspective, and (ii) how much they focused on task-relevant movie features (social perspective: faces, speech, body language, characters'  intentions, characters' appearance; non-social perspective: furniture, furnishing, details of the rooms, condition of the houses, condition of the gardens). The subjects also wrote short freeform accounts on how they adopted each perspective. In Experiment 2, the subjects were additionally asked to describe what particular details they found important for the different perspectives.  Eye-gaze recording  In Experiment 1, eye gaze was recorded in a separate session from 31 independent subjects (all male, mean age 25 yrs, range 19–38). The design was identical to that in the fMRI experiment with the following exceptions: Eye gaze was recorded with an EyeLink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada; sampling rate 1000 Hz, spatial accuracy better than 0.5°, with a 0.01° resolution in the pupiltracking mode). A nine-point calibration and validation was completed prior to the experiment. Saccade detection was performed using a velocity threshold of 30°/s and an acceleration threshold of 4000°/s2. The movie was broken down into nine segments, and eye-tracker drift was corrected at the beginning of each segment.  In Experiment 2, we gathered the eye gaze data with similar equipment and parameters but this time during fMRI scanning so that the 10-min video clip was shown in its entirety and the eye tracker was calibrated only once before the experiment. Due to technical difﬁculties, the eye-tracking data were lost from two subjects so that 11 subjects (6 females) were included in the eye-gaze analysis. Because the experiment was relatively long and no intermediate drift correction was performed, we retrospectively corrected the mean effect of the drift. We ﬁrst calculated the mean of all ﬁxation locations over the entire experiment (both perspectives) for each subject, and then rigidly shifted the ﬁxation distributions so that the mean ﬁxation location coincided with the grand mean ﬁxation location over all subjects.  fMRI data analysis  Inter-subject synchronization of brain activity  To analyze the similarity of brain activity across participants in each experimental condition, we computed group-mean ISC maps over all pairs of subjects when they (i) shared the decorator perspective, (ii) shared the detective perspective, and (iii) when they had mismatching perspectives (i.e., subject pairs where one subject was viewing from the detective and the other subject from the decorator perspective). ISC matrices were obtained for each brain voxel by calculating all pairwise Pearson's correlation coefﬁcients (r) of the voxel time courses across the participants and conditions, resulting in 780 (i.e. 20 subjects in both perspectives compared with all other subjects in both perspectives) unique pairwise r-values for each voxel in Experiment 1 and 325 pairwise values per voxel in Experiment 2. To test the statistical signiﬁcance of the resulting ISC maps, we performed a non-parametric permutation test for r statistic by randomly circularly shifting each subject's time course and calculating r statistic 1,000,000 times. For visualization, we selected the maximum observed value in the null distribution as the threshold of signiﬁcant ISC. Finally, the ISCs were also calculated in 10-sample sliding windows.  Testing for mean ISC differences across perspectives  Differences between the ISC maps in the detective and decorator conditions were compared using permutation testing based on the Pearson–Filon sum statistics on Fisher's Z-transformed correlation coefﬁcients (ZPF statistics) as implemented in the ISC toolbox (Kauppi et al., 2014). The ZPF statistics were derived from the r-values by ﬁrst applying the Fisher's Z-transform and then calculating their transformed difference between the perspectives for each subject pair (Kauppi et al., 2010; Raghunathan et al., 1996). The group-level statistics were then estimated as the sum of the ZPF statistics over the subject pairs. Thus, the sum statistic corresponds to the sum of the pairwise  J.M. Lahnakoski et al. / NeuroImage 100 (2014) 316–324  319  differences of ISC strength across perspectives. To estimate the statistical signiﬁcance of mean ISC difference across perspectives, the maximum and minimum sum statistics were sampled with 25,000 random permutations of the group labels of each pair. The maximum (minimum) statistics were sampled to estimate the largest differences that would be observed by chance over the entire brain between randomly shufﬂed groups, thus controlling for the family-wise error (FWE) rate as implemented in the ISC toolbox.  Classifying participants with same vs. different perspectives from the ISC matrices  To directly test our hypothesis that viewing the movie from a similar perspective increases the ISC of brain activity compared with watching it from different perspectives (i.e. the activity is consistent within a perspective but different across perspectives) we calculated the contrast of within-perspective ISCs (pairs where both subjects shared the same perspective) vs. across-perspective ISCs (pairs where one subject assumed the decorator and another the detective perspective or vice versa) using the Mantel test (Mantel, 1967) based on the correlation of the upper triangle entries of the correlation matrix with a template matrix (Fig. 1B). The statistical signiﬁcance of the results was estimated by recalculating the correlations with 1,000,000 random permutations of the ISC matrix of randomly selected voxels.  Finally, to reveal how well the two perspectives could be separated from each other based on the activity time courses of single voxels, we used (i) a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classiﬁer (Fix and Hodges, 1951) based on ISC matrices of individual voxels (Fig. 1C) with odd k-values from 1 to 31, and (ii) a linear support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) based on the Euclidean distance of the standardized BOLD time courses, and leave-one-out cross-validation approach at each voxel to ﬁnd brain areas that separated the perspectives signiﬁcantly better compared with the mean of 1,000,000 random classiﬁcations.1 Because kNN classiﬁers can be sensitive to noise, especially with low k-values (Mitchell et al., 2004), the mean classiﬁcation accuracy over all k-values was used to reveal time points where the classiﬁcation was successful, yet unaffected by the chosen k-value. We further required that the areas should show signiﬁcantly above-chance classiﬁcation with at least half of the selected k-values. To conﬁrm the reliability of the results, the kNN-classiﬁer was also run separately on the data of the two experiments. To compare the results to the moment-to-moment classiﬁcation accuracy of eye-tracking data, the classiﬁer was trained and tested in sliding windows (length of 10 samples) to reveal which time windows showed best classiﬁcation accuracies.  Eye-gaze analysis  Subject-wise ﬁxation heatmaps were generated by modeling each ﬁxation as a Gaussian function with mu of ﬁxation's Cartesian coordinate and sigma of approximately 1° (i.e., full-width-at-half-maximum was approximately 2.35°) and multiplied with ﬁxation duration. Subjectwise ﬁxation distributions across perspectives were compared with two-sample t-tests. Mean saccade amplitudes and ﬁxation durations were computed for each condition. Finally, we measured the degree of temporal inter-subject synchronization of eye movements by dividing the movie into 2-s time-windows, corresponding to the TR used in fMRI. These 2-s windows thus allowed a potentially different ﬁxation order of the same spatial locations between participants during the time windows. Next, a mean spatial inter-subject correlation of the ﬁxation heatmaps (inter-subject correlation of eye gaze, eyeISC;  1 Both classiﬁcation approaches yielded similar results. The peak classiﬁcation accuracies for the SVM classiﬁer were slightly higher than the mean kNN-accuracies over kvalues, as has been reported in prior literature (Mitchell et al., 2004). However, the null distribution of the SVM classiﬁer had heavier tails than that of the kNN-classiﬁer, which rendered the thresholded results very similar. For the sake of conciseness, we only report the results of the kNN-classiﬁer (see the Results section).  Nummenmaa et al., 2014) was computed for each time window. To calculate the spatial correlation, the ﬁxation heatmaps were reshaped to vectors and the Pearson's product–moment correlation coefﬁcient was calculated between the vector pairs.  The average eyeISC for each individual was ﬁrst estimated by calculating the mean eyeISC between that subject and all other individuals adopting the same perspective. We then performed t-tests for each time window to reveal the time bins where eyeISC differed statistically signiﬁcantly between the groups assuming different perspectives. Furthermore, we tested whether the within-perspective eyeISC differed from the across-perspective eyeISC using the Mantel test (see description in the Classifying participants with same vs. different perspectives from the ISC matrices section), and whether the groups could be classiﬁed based only on the eyeISC matrices calculated over the whole experiment using a kNN classiﬁer with odd values of k from 1 to 31. The classiﬁcation accuracy was then compared with distributions of 100,000 random classiﬁcations for each k-value. Additionally, we used a linear support vector machine SVM classiﬁer based on the pairwise Euclidean distance of the subjects' standardized (Z-scored) ﬁxation heatmaps to test whether gaze distribution over the movie would predict the adopted perspective. Finally, a similar classiﬁcation was performed in 2-s sliding windows with 0.1-s hops between windows to reveal the scenes that contained maximum gaze information regarding the participants' perspectives.  Predicting cerebral ISC with eyeISC  To quantify the relationship between inter-subject synchronization of eye gaze and brain activity, we computed moment-by-moment ISC of brain activity by calculating the average ISC for each acquired EPI using a 10-sample (20 s) sliding window. The eyeISC time courses were then aligned with the middle samples of the cerebral ISC windows, and the hemodynamic lag was accounted for with a single gamma function (delay 6 s). Finally, the correlations between aligned eyeISC time courses and the voxel-wise ISC time courses were calculated.  The null distribution for the eyeISC time course vs. ISC time course comparison was obtained by correlating the ISC time courses with a surrogate version of the eyeISC time courses using bootstrap resampling (circular shifting by at least ﬁve samples). Therefore, any observed synchrony in the null distribution between ISC and eyeISC circularly-shifted time courses should be false positives. We built the null distribution based on the procedure implemented in the ISC toolbox for statistical testing; the method has been demonstrated to be appropriate for fMRI data (Pajula et al., 2012). We estimated the null distribution through 1,000,000 circular shifts and corrected the resulting p-values using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction with an independence or positive dependence assumption (q = 0.05). Finally, a similar analysis was performed on the classiﬁcation-accuracy time courses to examine whether the eye-gaze classiﬁcation accuracy was correlated with the brainactivity classiﬁcation accuracy.  Results  Subjective ratings and eye-gaze recordings  The subjects in Experiment 1 reported paying more attention to taskrelevant features during both perspectives (t(19) = 19.58, p = 4.7 ∗ 2 = 0.95 for the detective and t(19) = 11.26, p = 7.5 ∗ 10−14, ηp 10−10, ηp 2 = 0.87 for the decorator condition, Fig. 2A). The mean difference scores for attention to task-relevant vs. task-irrelevant features were 2.78 for the detective and 2.48 for the decorator perspective (n.s.; t(19) = 1.74, p = 0.10, ηp 2 = 0.14). Participants reported assuming both perspectives equally easily, (t(19) = 0.93, p = 0.36, Mdetective = 3.25, Mdecorator = 3.50, Fig. 2B).  In their freeform accounts of perceptive-taking strategies that we transcribed by counting the perspective-relevant and perspective 320  J.M. Lahnakoski et al. / NeuroImage 100 (2014) 316–324  that the locations of the ﬁxations were too similar across perspectives to allow successful classiﬁcation.  The results of the eye-gaze analyses were similar in Experiment 2 where the eye gaze was recorded during fMRI scanning and in Experiment 1 where the eye gaze was recorded outside the scanner. The contrast of ﬁxation distributions across perspectives showed a similar pattern of increased visual sampling of the background in the decorator perspective and increased sampling of the middle area of the screen in the detective perspective. Furthermore, the time courses of eyeISC were highly correlated between the two datasets (r = 0.64 for detective, r = 0.63 for decorator; Figs. 3D and E).  Inter-subject synchronization of brain activity  During both perspective-taking conditions, brain activity was synchronized across participants in sensory and associative regions (Fig. 4). Synchrony was strongest in the visual and auditory projection cortices although reliable synchronization was also observed in the parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. These brain areas were also synchronized between individuals taking different perspectives (i.e., over pairs where one subject was assuming the detective and the other the decorator perspective). The results were replicable in Experiments 1 and 2 analyzed separately, and therefore data from the two experiments were pooled.  Taking the detective vs. decorator perspectives increased intersubject synchronization in several brain areas, including the lateral and medial occipital, posterior parietal and ventral temporal regions, as well as in the superior temporal sulcus, parts of the superior temporal gyrus, and the temporoparietal junction (Fig. 5). Moreover, the lateral occipital, inferior temporal, and posterior parietal cortical regions showed signiﬁcantly higher ISC in subject pairs assuming the same perspective than in pairs assuming different perspectives (Fig. 6). Therefore, we could predict the correct perspective of the left-out subjects based on the ISC with a signiﬁcantly above-chance accuracy in these higher-order areas (kNN: p b 0.001, uncorrected, corresponding to classiﬁcation accuracies of 63.6–68.2% in joint analysis of Experiments 1 and 2, 67.7%–72.5% in Experiment 1, and 73.1%–76.9% in Experiment 2. Exact accuracy depends on the selected value of k. Only areas where accuracy was signiﬁcant with at least half of the values of k are presented; Mantel test: q b 0.05, FDR corrected). Table 1 lists the coordinates of the voxels showing the greatest difference between within- vs. acrossperspective ISCs for each brain area.  The results of analogous analyses performed separately for Experiments 1 and 2 yielded concordant results. The differences in ISC between the detective vs. decorator perspectives were located in similar brain regions in both experiments but due to lower statistical power the areas showing higher ISC in the detective than the decorator condition were smaller than in the joint analysis of the experiments (Fig. 5B). A small region in the junction of the ventral anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex showed a small but statistically signiﬁcant effect in the opposite direction, but the effect was not robust enough to appear in either experiment alone. The classiﬁcation analysis revealed consistently overlapping regions of ventral and dorsal stream areas in both experiments (Fig. 6B).  While both eye-gaze patterns and brain activity were signiﬁcantly affected by the perspective-taking task, the eye-gaze patterns consistently predicted neither the ISC of brain activity nor the classiﬁcation accuracy based on the brain data.  Discussion  We show, for the ﬁrst time, that different individuals' fMRI signals synchronize when the individuals assume a similar psychological perspective while viewing a movie. We further demonstrate that such perspective taking is accompanied by changes in the selection of visual information as indexed by eye-gaze patterns during movie viewing.  Fig. 2. Behavioral ratings.

Red crosses indicate the mean rating over subjects.  irrelevant details in the answers, the subjects reported behaving in a perspective-relevant manner (p = 3.43 ∗ 10−15, Chi-squared goodnessof-ﬁt test against uniform distribution). When assuming the detective perspective, the subjects mentioned most often trying to assess the motives of the characters (8/20), by analyzing what the characters said (6/20), and by reading their facial expressions (6/20). Other things mentioned were looking for unusual behavior or things and assessing the emotional states and personality traits (e.g. tension, nervousness, aggression, and impulse control) of the characters.  In turn, while assuming the decorator perspective, the participants reported most often thinking of ways to improve the interiors/exteriors depicted in the clip (6/20), as well as focusing on the background (5/20) and colors of the houses and furnishings (5/20). Subjects also reported trying to obtain a general impression of the surroundings (e.g. general design, 3; general garden condition, 3; and style, 3) and focusing more on the details (e.g. details, 3; decorations, 3; and furniture, 2). Three subjects reported having actively tried to ignore people, conversations and/or the entire plot of the video during the decorator perspective.  The answers to the question about what speciﬁc details the subjects found important for each perspective in Experiment 2 yielded similar results although the examples given by the participants were more speciﬁc. For example, for the detective perspective, the subjects mentioned speciﬁc people and events in the movie (e.g. speciﬁc suspicious characters, police arresting a person, and discussion about a murder), while for the decorator perspective they reported details about the interiors and yards (e.g. condition of plants in the gardens and style of the furniture and decorations).  Eye movement analysis in Experiment 1 revealed that the detective (‘social’) perspective biased ﬁxations toward the center of the screen where the actors were typically shown, whereas the decorator (‘nonsocial’) perspective biased ﬁxations toward the edges of the screen where the interiors/exteriors were visible (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, participants made signiﬁcantly shorter saccades and longer ﬁxations during the detective than the decorator perspective (Fig. 3B). Inter-subject synchronization of eye movements (eyeISC) was signiﬁcantly stronger during the detective than the decorator perspective (Fig. 3C). Crucially, the difference in the strength of eyeISC between the detective vs. decorator perspectives was signiﬁcant only after the opening credits, which contained no task-relevant information (see the beginning of the time courses in Fig. 3C). Although the eye-movement parameters (i.e. saccade length and ﬁxation duration) between the perspectives were statistically different, both classiﬁcation approaches and the Mantel test based on the eyeISC matrices failed to separate the subjects based on the perspectives they had taken in 97% of the time windows as well as in the analysis based on the ﬁxation heatmaps of the entire experiment, thus suggesting  J.M.

D and E: Scatter plots of eye ISC across time windows in Experiment 1 vs. Experiment 2 in the detective and decorator perspectives. The red dashed line indicates the region where eyeISCExp1 = eyeISCExp2.  The observed inter-subject synchronization of brain activity was stronger in LOC and VTC participating in higher-order visual processing and in PPC having an important role in top-down allocation of attention (Corbetta and Schulman, 2002) when the subjects were assuming same vs. different perspectives toward the movie. Even though taking the detective vs. decorator perspectives increased synchronization also in the early visual cortical regions, ISC in these regions did not allow predicting which perspective the participants were taking. Rather, only the activity beyond the early visual areas in ventral and dorsal visual stream brain areas, including the parahippocampal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex and posterior parietal cortex, contained sufﬁcient information for accurate classiﬁcation. Critically, we observed concordant results in Experiments 1 and 2 involving the same design but with different subjects and scanners. While the brain areas found to be sensitive to perspective taking in the two experiments did not overlap completely (likely due to different scanners and individual variability in locations of functional brain regions) the overall effects were very  similar (see Figs. 5 and 6). Thus, the effects were replicable and highly consistent across participants.  ISC reﬂects similarity of perspective beyond visual sampling  The increased within- vs. across-perspective ISCs in the ventral and dorsal streams are unlikely to be accounted for by the eye-gaze patterns for the following reasons. Both eye gaze and early visual responses during the decorator perspective were consistently less similar calculated in both sliding windows and over the entire experiment compared with both (i) pairs where both participants were taking the detective perspective and (ii) pairs taking dissimilar perspectives. Recent evidence also indicates that neural responses in the ventral stream are largely invariant to eye movements (Nishimoto et al., 2013) and that activity in the posterior parietal cortex is poorly predicted by gaze during natural viewing (Salmi et al., 2014). Thus, the higher within- vs. acrossperspective ISCs in the dorsal and ventral streams may constitute a  322  J.M. Lahnakoski et al. / NeuroImage 100 (2014) 316–324  Fig. 4. Mean ISC maps. Maps show the mean ISC across subject pairs in the detective (top) and decorator (middle) perspectives. Bottom row shows the mean ISC across conditions (i.e., correlation between detective vs. decorator pairs). The results are based on combined data from Experiments 1 and 2.

In addition to the higher-order visual areas, ISC was increased during the detective vs. decorator perspectives also in the superior temporal sulcus and the adjoining temporoparietal junction that play important roles in social cognition (Allison et al., 2000; Lahnakoski et al., 2012a; Nummenmaa and Calder, 2009) and speech processing in particular (Boldt et al., 2013; Lahnakoski et al., 2012b). However, this effect was relatively small compared with the effects in the visual regions which may be, in part, explained by the difﬁculty of ignoring task-irrelevant social information, particularly the speech.  Receptive ﬁelds of sensory cortical neurons act as rapidly changing dynamic ﬁlters whose response gain and feature selectivity may be modiﬁed by attention to task-relevant features (Desimone and Duncan, 1995; Jääskeläinen et al., 2011). For example, attention to visual features, such as motion and color, modulates the response amplitudes in several extrastriate visual areas (Chawla et al., 1999). Analogous perspectivedriven ﬁltering mechanisms could explain modulations of higher-level brain responses in the present study. However, here the task-relevant features are not, for example, simple visual features. Rather, participants had to construct mental models to direct perspective-dependent search and monitor salient animate and inanimate objects. The brain regions revealed by our analyses may thus reﬂect the neural processes that enable these high-level models to guide attention and actions depending on the current goals. Furthermore, the cortical processes underlying these models operate in a synchronized manner across individuals who assume a shared psychological perspective to the movie events. Our results thus provide experimental evidence to support the proposal  Fig. 5. Brain regions showing stronger ISC during the detective than the decorator perspective (orange to yellow) and vice versa (blue to turquoise). A) Results calculated over both experiments.

B) Areas showing higher ISC in Experiment 1 (red), Experiment 2 (blue) or in both experiments (yellow). White outlines indicate the results from panel A.  (Hasson et al., 2004; Nummenmaa et al., 2012) that inter-subject synchronization of brain activity reﬂects the similarity of mental states and high-level information processing across individuals, rather than mere similarity in stimulus-driven neural activity.  The link between synchronized neural activity and ‘mind sharing’ is supported by a range of recent studies. The synchrony of brain activity between a sender and a receiver has been shown to enhance communication between individuals (Schippers et al., 2010; Stephens et al., 2010). People with increased risk perception of a health crisis (H1N1 pandemic) exhibit enhanced ISC in the anterior cingulate cortex (Schmälzle et al., 2013) during viewing of TV reports on the topic. The ISC of viewers' brain activity is increased during emotional episodes in a movie (Nummenmaa et al., 2012). Finally, activity in brain regions involved in language processing differs between individuals who listen to the same short stories but with different attentional tasks (Cooper et al., 2011). These ﬁndings support the notion that synchrony in the involved brain regions reﬂects how complex stimuli are interpreted rather than their physical characteristics.  Functions of brain areas participating in the tasks  Signiﬁcant perspective-dependent ISC in the posterior parietal cortical regions accords well with prior studies showing the activation of these regions during maintenance of a cognitive task set (Corbetta and Schulman, 2002; Esterman et al., 2009; Wager et al., 2004). This proposal is further supported by our behavioral data indicating that subjects adopting similar rather than dissimilar perspectives attended to more similar objects and events in the movie, which has likely increased the ISC in the PPC.  J.M.

Our results reveal that also higher-level perspective taking tasks synchronize the activation time courses across participants in the dorsal and ventral visual streams, suggesting that naturalistic experimental paradigms can provide a valid way to probe complex cognitive processes in real-life-like experimental conditions.  To further address the brain basis of psychological perspective taking, future work should address how the function of the brain regions revealed here differ between a ‘true’ psychological perspective taking task compared, for example, with explicit attention to people vs. objects and places during naturalistic stimulation. It will also be of interest to characterize how the functional network structure between brain areas changes during different tasks.  Effects of perspective taking on eye gaze  Even though we could not classify the subjects' perspective based on the eye movement data alone, the eye gaze patterns were more synchronous in the detective than the decorator perspective. Such a result accords with prior behavioral work on perspective-driven text and scene processing, which have consistently found that some perspectives produce larger effects than others, possibly due to task constrains or the number of items relevant for each perspective (Anderson and Pichert, 1978; Kaakinen and Hyönä, 2008). Subjects probably also have more overlapping prototypical knowledge on some perspectives than others (Kaakinen and Hyönä, 2008), which may increase the similarity of interpretation of the scenes and the associated brain activity. Additionally, the gaze differences across perspectives may be related to different processing modes of the visual scenes. The eye-gaze patterns, with longer ﬁxations and shorter saccades during the detective than the decorator perspective and vice versa, suggested that during the detective perspective the subjects adopted a focal and during the decorator perspective an ambient processing mode (Pannasch and Velichkovsky, 2009).  Methodological remark  Viewing the same video naturally elicits robust inter-subject correlation in wide cortical regions even when the subjects are focusing on different aspects of the video (see bottom panel of Fig. 4). To reveal genuine perspective-driven ISC modulations, we reduced the betweensubjects variance by using a fully counterbalanced within-subjects design. In general, the effects of the perspective-taking task were larger during the ﬁrst viewing. However, some effects were reversed during the second viewing, thus suggesting that these effects were not related to perspective taking and were rather reﬂecting inherent group differences.  Conclusions  Our results, replicated in two experiments on independent subject groups, demonstrate that sharing a psychological perspective with  Fig. 6.

Abbreviations: LOC — lateral occipital cortex, PHG — parahippocampal gyrus, PPC — posterior parietal cortex. For the coordinates of the peak voxels, see Table 1.  The ventral temporal areas modulated here by the perspectivetaking task have been linked to processing of objects and scenes (Haxby et al., 2001), but their activity is also modulated by task demands, such as working-memory load (Rose et al., 2005). Furthermore, attention increases activity induced by the attended category of visual stimuli in the parahippocampal and fusiform gyri during perception of scenes and faces, respectively (Vuontela et al., 2013). The parahippocampal gyrus also plays an important role in the associative process that shapes  324  J.M.

This perspective-driven enhancement of inter-subject synchronization of brain activity likely reﬂects the similarity of the mental states of individuals rather than the similarity of sensory input. Importantly, the synchrony in these brain regions could be an important mechanism supporting maintenance of similar psychological perspectives across individuals, and ultimately supporting mutual understanding of the shared environment.

Appendix A  Instructions for inducing the perspectives  Social perspective (forensic detective): “Next we will show you a short movie. One of the individuals depicted in the movie is guilty of homicide. While watching the movie, your task is to assume the role of a forensic detective. Your task is to evaluate which persons act suspiciously and could be potential suspects for murder. Be prepared to answer questions related to the movie after the experiment”.  Non-social perspective (interior decorator): “Next we will show you a short movie. The exteriors and interiors of the houses depicted in the movie need improvement. While watching the movie, your task is to assume the role of an interior and exterior decorator. Your task is to evaluate how you could improve the interiors and exteriors you see in order to make them more comfortable. Be prepared to answer questions related to the movie after the experiment”.

The   present   study   examined   whether   HTR3A   methylation   might   be   associated   with   mothers’   lifetime   exposure   to  interpersonal   violence   (IPV),   IPV-related   psychopathology,   child disturbance   of   attachment,   and   maternal   neural   activity. Methods:   Number   of   maternal   lifetime   IPV   exposures   and   measures   of   maternal   psychopathology   including  posttraumatic   stress   disorder   (PTSD),   major   depression   and   aggressive   behavior   (AgB),   and   a  measure of  child   attachment   disturbance   known   as   “secure   base   distortion”   (SBD)   were   assessed   in   a   sample   of 35   mothers   and  children   aged   12–42   months.   Brain   fMRI   activation   was  assessed   in   mothers   using   30s   silent   ﬁlm   excerpts   depicting   menacing   adult   male-female   interactions   versus   prosocial   and  neutral interactions.   Group   and   continuous   analyses   were   performed   to   test   for   associations   between   clinical and   fMRI   variables   with   DNA   methylation. Results:   Maternal   IPV   exposure-frequency   was  associated   with   maternal   PTSD;   and  maternal   IPV-PTSD was   in   turn   associated   with   child   SBD.   Methylation   status   of   several   CpG   sites   in   the  HTR3A   gene   was associated   with   maternal   IPV   and  IPV-PTSD   severity,   AgB  and   child   SBD,   in   particular,   self-endangering behavior.  Methylation   status   at   a  speciﬁc   CpG   site   (CpG2   III)   was   associated   with   decreased   medial   prefrontal   cortical   (mPFC)   activity   in   response   to  ﬁlm-stimuli   of  adult   male-female   interactions   evocative   of violence   as   compared   to   prosocial   and   neutral   interactions. Conclusions:   Methylation   status   of   the  HTR3A   gene   in   mothers   is   linked   to   maternal   IPV-related   psychopathology,   trauma-induced   brain   activation   patterns,   and   child   attachment   disturbance   in   the  form of  SBD   during   a   sensitive   period   in   the   development   of   self-regulation.  ©   2016   The   Authors.

Schechter  et  al.  /  Behavioural  Brain  Research  325  (2017)  268–277   269  1.  Introduction  1.1.  The  serotonergic  system  as  linked  to  early  life  stress  and aggression  Dysfunction  of  the  serotonergic  system  has  been  linked  both  to early  life  stress  and  to  aggression  [1].  And  yet  the  potential  role of  serotonin  in  the  intergenerational  transmission  of  violence  and related  trauma  remains  largely  unknown  [2].  Recent  work  indicates  that  serotonin  modulates  brain  circuits  in  a  cell-type  speciﬁc manner  through  a  large  family  of  receptors  [3].  In  addition,  serotonin  neurons  located  in  the  midbrain  are  molecularly  diverse [4]  with  subsets  of  serotonin  neurons  possibly  regulating  different  types  of  physiological  functions  [5].  Using  recent  methods  of circuit  dissection  in  rodents,  the  activity  of  raphe  serotonergic  neurons  has  been  shown  to  control  a  range  of  emotional  behaviors [6].  More  speciﬁcally,  serotonin  has  been  proposed  to  modulate aggressive  behaviors  in  animal  and  human  experimental  models [7,8].  Whether  subsets  of  serotonin  neurons  speciﬁcally  control aggression  remains  to  be  determined.  Correlative  studies  in  humans  have  focused  on  the  primary metabolite  of  serotonin,  5-hydroxyindoleacetic  acid  (5-HIAA). Using  this  measure  of  serotonin  function,  low  cerebrospinal  ﬂuid (CSF)  5-HIAA  concentrations  have  been  associated  with  peer-peer aggression  in  non-human  primates  [9].  In  addition,  low  maternal CSF  5-HIAA  was  associated  with  maternal  abuse  of  infants  among macaque  monkeys  [10].  In  humans,  a  low  concentration  of  5-HIAA has  been  associated  with  lifetime  aggression,  impulsive  acts  of violence  and  antisocial  behavior  across  20  separate  studies  [11]. Finally,  variants  in  serotonin-related  genes  including  the  serotonin receptor  2A  (HTR2A)  and  the  monoamine  oxydase  A  (MAOA)  have been  associated  with  impulsive  aggression  towards  self  and  others in  a  number  of  human  studies  [12,13].  Interactions  between  serotonin-related  genetic  variants  and early  life  stress  including  typically  traumatogenic  events  such  as child  maltreatment  have  been  observed  in  rodents,  macaques  and human  [14].  However,  few  studies  have  examined  the  link  between serotonin-related  genetic  variants  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD).  An  interaction  between  5-HT2A  variants  and  childhood sexual  abuse  exposure  has  been  shown  to  increase  risk  for  PTSD and  comorbid  depression  in  an  African  American  university-based population  [15].  1.2.  Epigenetics  of  the  serotonin  receptor  3A  and  early-onset exposure  to  maltreatment  and  other  forms  of  interpersonal violence  More  recently,  epigenetic  studies  have  started  to  establish a  link  between  early-life  adversity  and  methylation  levels  in stress-related  genes  in  psychiatric  conditions,  including  borderline  personality  disorder,  generalized  anxiety  symptoms,  and  PTSD [16,17].  In  addition  some  of  these  studies  have  started  to  investigate whether  methylation  changes  could  be  correlated  with  stressrelated  patterns  of  neural  activation  measured  by  fMRI  [18,19].  In  this  regard,  the  serotonin  receptor  3A  (HTR3A)  is  of  particular interest.  In  rodents,  the  HTR3A  is  speciﬁcally  expressed  in  speciﬁc subsets  of  interneurons  [20,21].  It  controls  early  cellular  processes involved  in  circuit  formation  [21,22],  regulates  neuronal  amygdala excitability  [23]  and  is  required  for  fear  extinction  [24].  In  humans, genetic  variation  in  the  HTR3A  has  been  shown  to  interact  with early-life  adversity  [25,26]  and  has  been  associated  with  psychiatric  disorders  including  bipolar  disorder  [27,28]  and  PTSD  [15]. More  recently,  childhood  maltreatment  including  physical  abuse has  been  shown  to  modulate  the  methylation  status  of  several  CpG sites  in  the  promoter  regions  of  the  HTR3A  gene  in  individuals diagnosed  with  ADHD,  bipolar  disorder  or  borderline  personality  disorder  [29].  Interestingly,  the  methylation  status  of  a  speciﬁc  CpG site  (named  CpG2  III  based  on  the  Perroud  et  al.  study  [29])  was found  to  be  strongly  modulated  by  a  functional  SNP  (rs1062613) located  at  1  base-pair  away  from  CpG2  III.  Furthermore,  both  the CpG2  III  methylation  and  rs1062613  were  recently  found  to  modulate  the  binding  of  the  transcription  factor  CCCTC-binding  factor (CTCF)  [30],  strongly  suggesting  functional  biological  signiﬁcance. Of  note,  none  of  the  aforementioned  studies  looking  at  methylation  of  the  HTR3A  gene  thus  far  has  examined  whether  PTSD was  present  or  comorbid  with  the  psychiatric  disorders  characterizing  the  sample.  In  the  instance  of  PTSD  being  linked  to early-onset,  repeated  and  chronic  exposure  to  maltreatment  and other  forms  of  interpersonal  violence,  HPA-axis  functioning  and related  methylation  of  the  glucocorticoid  receptor  have  been  found to  show  patterns  that  are  distinct  from  those  associated  with  mood disorders,  despite  frequent  comorbidity  [31–33].  And  therefore, methylation  studies  of  stress-related  genes  HTR3A  gene  are  needed within  samples  of  patients  suffering  from  PTSD  related  to  childhood  maltreatment  and  subsequent  exposure  to  other  forms  of interpersonal  violence.  In  the  present  paper,  we   therefore  examined  within  a  sample of  adult  women   who  were  mothers  of  young  children  (ages  12–42 months),  methylation  of  the  maternal  HTR3A  gene  promoter  region, with  speciﬁc  attention  to  CpG2  III,  and  its  relationship  with  maternal  life  stress,  interpersonal  violence  related  post-traumatic  stress disorder  (IPV-PTSD),  aggression  and  neural  activity  in  response  to a  trauma  trigger.  We   then  also  asked  if  child  psychopathology  in the  form  of  a  characteristic  attachment  disturbance  within  this high-risk  sample,  and  in  particular  child  self-endangering  behavior  within  the  context  of  this  attachment  disturbance,  might  also  be associated  with  one  or  more  of  the  maternal  variables  in  question. To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  ﬁrst  paper  to  explore  these  relationships  individually  and  together.  1.3.  Hypotheses  Our  hypotheses  are  the  following: Methylation  of  the  maternal  HTR3A  gene  promoter  region,  in  particular  at  CpG2  III,  will  be  associated  with  the  following:  1)  Maternal  exposure  to  interpersonal  violence  since  childhood (i.e.  physical  abuse,  domestic  violence  exposure  and  subsequent victimization)  as  well  as  with  related  maternal  PTSD  and  aggression  2)  Child  symptoms  such  as  separation  anxiety,  self-endangering behavior,  and  hypervigilance  that  are  linked  to  maternal  dysregulation  in  the  context  of  maternal  interpersonal  violence exposure-related  PTSD  and  aggression.  3)  Decreased  neural  activity  in  maternal  brain  regions  associated with  emotion  regulation  (i.e.  mPFC)  following  exposure  to  ﬁlm scenes  evoking  escalation  to  male-female  violence  in  comparison  to  a  control  condition  that  will  in  turn  be  related  to  an increase  in  child  symptoms  such  as  separation  anxiety,  selfendangering  behavior,  and  hypervigilance.  2.  Methods  2.1.  Participants  and  procedures  The  institutional  ethics  committee  at  the  Geneva  University Hospitals  approved  this  research  project  which  is  in  accordance with  the  Helsinki  Declaration  [34].  Participants  gave  written informed  consent  both  for  themselves  as  well  as  their  child.  Women and  their  young  children  were  recruited  by  ﬂyers  posted  at  the Geneva  University  Hospitals  and  Faculty  of  Medicine  and  other  270   D.S.  Schechter  et  al.  /  Behavioural  Brain  Research  325  (2017)  268–277  Faculties,  as  well  as  at  community  centers,  daycares,  pre-schools, and  domestic  violence  agencies  and  shelters.  Any  mother  and  child dyad  who  responded  and  who  followed  through  with  an  appointment  was  screened.  Fathers  and  other  partners  of  mothers  were not  seen  in  the  study  due  to  concerns  over  safety  and  maintenance of  trust  for  women  who  had  experienced  partner  violence.  Exclusion  criteria  were  as  follows:  Non-biological  mothers,  mothers  who had  not  lived  with  their  child  for  the  majority  of  the  child’s  life  since birth,  mothers  who  experienced  symptoms  of  psychosis  or  active substance  abuse  or  had  mental  or  physical  disability  that  would preclude  participation  in  research  tasks.  Due  to  physiological  measurements  taken,  women  who  were  pregnant  or  breast-feeding were  not  accepted  into  the  study.  Children  were  included  in  the study  if  they  were  12–42  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  scheduled mother-child  behavioral  observations  and  if  they  had  no  mental or  physical  disability  that  would  preclude  participation  in  research tasks.  Within  one  month  after  the  screening  visit,  participants  completed  two  videotaped  visits  over  the  ensuing  1–2  month  period. During  the  screening  visit,  following  informed  consent,  mothers were  given  a  socio-demographic  and  life-events  interview  followed  by  several  self-report  questionnaires.  During  the  next  visit, mothers  were  interviewed  without  their  child  present,  with  a focus  on  the  mother’s  mental  representations  of  her  child  and relationship  with  her  child,  an  elaboration  of  her  traumatic  lifeevents,  followed  by  structured  diagnostic  interviews  and  a  series of  dimensional  measures.  Then,  1–2  weeks  later,  mothers  were asked  to  bring  their  child  to  the  lab  for  a  mother-child  interaction procedure  otherwise  known  as  the  “Modiﬁed  Crowell  Procedure”  [35].  This  procedure  involves  free  play,  separation-reunion, structured  play,  repeated  separation-reunion  and  exposure  to  novelty.  This  mother-child  interaction  procedure  was   followed  by administration  of  measures  focusing  on  the  child’s  life  events, psychopathology,  and  social-emotional  development.  Saliva  samples  were  taken  for  DNA  extraction  (as  described  in  more  detail below)  prior  to  the  Modiﬁed  Crowell  Procedure.  After  each  of these  visits,  mothers  received  50  Swiss  francs  along  with  a small  book  or  toy  for  their  child  following  the  parent-child visit.  Mothers  who  consented  and  were  eligible  for  MRI   scanning were  invited  within  2–4  weeks  after  the  mother-child  visit,  to the  hospital-based  neuroimaging  center.  After  a  clinician  and  neuroimaging  specialist-guided  orientation  to  the  MRI   scanner  and scanning  process,  mothers  participated  in  the  fMRI  protocol  as described  below  [18].  For  a  subset  of  39  mothers  (mean  age  mothers  34.4  years, SD  =  5.7  years,  mean  age  children:  26.9  months,  SD.  8.2  months), datasets  including  fMRI  data  and  successful  DNA  extraction  from saliva  were  available  for  5HT3a.  Three  mothers  were  excluded  due to  motion  in  the  MRI   and  one  due  to  a  non-IPV  related  PTSD.  Seventeen  of  the  remaining  35  participants  were  mothers  without  PTSD (controls),  and  18  mothers  were  diagnosed  with  IPV-PTSD.  2.2.  IPV  and  other  traumatic  life  events  History  of  traumatic  events  throughout  the  mothers’  lifetime was  assessed  via  two  measures:  the  Brief  Physical  and  Sexual  Abuse Questionnaire  (BPSAQ)  [36],  and  the  Traumatic  Life  Events  Questionnaire  (TLEQ)  [37].  To  avoid  redundancy,  the  authors  did  not repeat  items  exploring  childhood  traumatic  events  on  the  TLEQ that  had  already  been  probed  on  the  BPSAQ,  a  more  comprehensive measure  for  childhood  events.  Scoring  of  the  BPSAQ  was   undertaken  as  described  in  a  paper  by  Schechter  and  colleagues  [38]. The  number  of  lifetime  violent  events  was  the  sum  of  the  number  of  items  endorsed  on  the  BPSAQ  related  to  childhood  physical abuse,  sexual  abuse,  and  exposure  to  domestic  violence  added  to  the  number  of  items  endorsed  on  the  TLEQ  related  to  partner  and non-partner  physical  and  sexual  assault  during  adulthood  as  well as  military  combat,  other  exposure  to  war  or  terrorism,  or  community  violence  since  birth.  For  purposes  of  grouping,  endorsement  of any  of  these  interpersonal  violent  items  on  the  BPSAQ  and/or  TLEQ that  met   the  “A”-criterion  for  PTSD  according  to  the  DSM-IV  and associated  with  PTSD  symptoms  would  identify  the  subject  as  having  IPV-PTSD.  Endorsement  of  medical/surgical/obstetrical  events, vehicular  or  other  life-threatening  accidents,  exposure  to  natural disaster,  or  sudden  loss  meeting  the  A-criterion  for  PTSD  according to  the  DSM-IV  and  associated  with  PTSD  symptoms  would  identify  the  subject  as  having  “non-IPV-PTSD”.  The  latter  subjects  were excluded  from  analyses  due  to  a  small  number  of  subjects  (n  =  15). The  severity  of  maternal  aggression  (i.e.  use  of  verbal  threats  and physical  violence)  in  the  context  of  adult  romantic  relationships was  measured  via  the  Conﬂicts  Tactics  Scale-2,  Short  Version  (CTS2) [39].  PTSD  diagnosis  was   determined  via  the  Clinician  Administered PTSD  Scale  (CAPS)  [40].  Mothers  were  included  in  the  IPV-PTSD diagnosis  group  if  they  had  experienced  an  interpersonal  violent event  that  met   the  PTSD  A-criterion  and  their  CAPS  score  was greater  than  or  equal  to  55.  Maternal  depressive  symptoms  were assessed  via  the  Beck  Depression  Inventory-II  [41]  as  a  self-report measure  for  the  current  subjective  symptom  severity.  Child  psychopathology  was   measured  via  the  Disturbances  of Attachment  Interview  [42]  which  is  a  12-item  clinician-rated  measure  that  takes  into  account  maternal  report  as  well  as  clinical observation  and  judgment.  Of  its  three  subscales:  inhibited  and  disinhibited  attachment  and  secure  base  distortion,  we  only  included the  latter  subscale,  as  based  on  clinical  indices  from  a  prior  study [43]  One  year  after  the  initial  evaluation,  the  Child  Behavior  Checklist  for  Children  1.5–5  Years  [44]  was  mailed  to  mothers  for completion  and  return.  Of  this  measure,  the  aggressive  behavior subscale  only  was  included  in  analyses.  2.3.  Saliva  sampling  and  DNA  extraction  Participants  were  instructed  not  to  eat  or  drink  for  one  hour prior  to  the  test.  Subsequently,  a  trained  technician  asked  each participant  to  chew  on  a  Salivette® swab  for  3  min.  The  Salivette® −30 ◦C. swab  was   then  placed  in  a  labeled  plastic  tube  and  frozen  at  DNA  was  extracted  with  a  speciﬁc  extraction  kit  (GE  Healthcare RPN  8501,  Glattbrugg,  Switzerland).  We   conducted  quantiﬁcation analysis  of  DNA  samples  with  Qubit  (the  Qubit® 2.0  Fluorometer, Invitrogen)  and  the  quality  of  DNA  fragments  was   veriﬁed  with ␮g  of  extracted  DNA  with gel  electrophoresis.  We   then  modiﬁed  2  sodium  bisulﬁte  via  EpiTect  Bisulﬁte  Kit  (Quiagen,  Germantown, MD,   USA)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  protocol.  PCR  ampliﬁcations  were  performed  using  primers  speciﬁc  for  each  5ht3aR  assays ␮l with  the  HotStarTaq  Master  Mix   Kit  (Qiagen,  California,  USA)  on  2  of  the  post  bisulﬁte-treated  DNA.  A  vacuum  workstation  was   used to  isolate  single  stranded  biotinylated  DNA  molecules  in  presence of  the  corresponding  sequencing  primers.  Nucleotides,  enzyme  and substrate  for  pyrosequencing  were  from  Qiagen  (PyroMark  Gold Reagents)  and  the  reactions  were  performed  on  a  PyroMark  Q96 MD  instrument.  The  degree  of  CpG  methylation  was   measured  in duplicates  and  automatically  by  the  Pyro  Q-CpG  Software  (Biotage AB,  Uppsala,  Sweden)  by  pyrosequencing.  Given  previous  work [29]  indicating  a  link  between  child  maltreatment  and  modiﬁcations  in  the  methylation  status  of  CpG  sites  located  in  the  promoter region  of  the  HTR3A,   seven  HTR3A  CpGs  sites  from  Perroud  et  al. (2016)  [29]  were  examined  in  the  present  study  (CpG1  I,  CpG2  II, CpG3  II,  CpG2  III,  CpG3  III,  CpG4  III,  CpG5  III)  (Supplementary  Fig. S1).  In  addition,  previous  work  indicated  that  the  methylation status  of  CpG2  III  located  in  close  vicinity  of  a  functional  SNP  (RS1062613)  modulates  binding  of  the  transcription  factor  CTCF [45].  3.  Results  D.S.  Schechter  et  al.  /  Behavioural  Brain  Research  325  (2017)  268–277   271  2.4.  MRI   procedure  Given  the  particular  importance  of  intimate-partner  violence among  women  with  IPV-PTSD,  we  used  video  stimuli  depicting  neutral,  menacing,  and  male-female  prosocial  interactions as  described  in  a  previous  study  that  drew  on  the  same  sample  [18].  Twenty-three  silent  20-s  video  excerpts  that  displayed male-female  interactions  were  extracted  from  feature  ﬁlms.  These excerpts  were  grouped  into  3  conditions:  8  excerpts  displayed menace  and  high  levels  of  negative  affect,  8  displayed  prosocial/romantic  interaction  and  moderately  to  highly  positive  affect, and  7  displayed  neutral  affect.  The  categorization  of  those  excerpts was  done  by  an  unpublished  rating  study,  the  details  of  which can  be  found  in  the  Supplementary  materials.  Detailed  image acquisition  and  pre-processing  are  described  in  the  Supplementary materials.  After  the  MRI   visit,  mothers  received  200  Swiss  francs.  2.5.  Data  analyses  All  data  were  analyzed  with  SPSS  version  22  (IBM  Corp.,  Armonk, NY,  USA).  For  behavioral  data,  statistical  signiﬁcance  was   ﬁxed  at p  <  0.05.  The  sample  was  restricted  to  the  35  mothers  who  had complete  data  with  respect  to  5-HT3a  methylation,  MRI,  and  clinical  measures.  Correlations  between  HTR3A  methylation,  behavioral and  questionnaire  data  were  performed  using  the  Spearman  correlation  coefﬁcient,  since  a  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test  for  normality ≤ of  the  data  was  signiﬁcant  across  CpGs  (p    0.05).  We,   furthermore, performed  posthoc  tests  for  each  of  the  brain  activity  clusters  that we  identiﬁed  on  fMRI  analyses  (as  speciﬁed  in  the  next  paragraph). These  posthoc  tests  correlated  the  mean  activity  of  each  identiﬁed cluster  with  maternal  IPV-PTSD,  and  HTR3A  methylation  levels.  Speciﬁcally,  in  ﬁrst  level  fMRI  analysis,  we  produced  a  contrast between  the  average  neural  activity  in  response  to  seeing  malefemale  interactions  depicting  menace  as  compared  to  scenes  of romantic-prosocial  and  as  compared  to  scenes  of  neutral  interactions  such  as  joint  attention.  Both  comparisons  were  used  to test  whether  effects  were  due  to  a  response  particular  to  menacing  interactions  rather  than  to  the  contrast  conditions.  In  2nd level  analysis  we  applied  correlations  to  examine  the  associations between  this  contrast  and  an  ordinal  scaled  version  of  the  mean HTR3A  methylation  (to  account  for  non-normality  of  that  data) within  a  whole-brain  analysis.  A  cluster-extent  based  thresholding  approach  was  used  to  correct  for  multiple  comparisons  created by  the  high  number  of  voxels  analyzed.  A  previous  study  had  indicated  that  via  simulation  with  10,000  iterations,  a  false  positive probability  of  0.05  was   achieved  under  the  condition  that  each reported  regional  cluster  include  at  least  27  contiguous  voxels ×   3  mm)   with  an  uncorrected  p  <  0.005  [46].  For  our (3  mm  whole-brain  analysis,  the  threshold  of  signiﬁcance  was  thus  deﬁned as  an  uncorrected  p  <  0.005  with  at  least  27  contiguous  voxels  necessary  to  constitute  a  signiﬁcant  ﬁnding.  A  cluster-extent  based thresholding  approach  was  used  to  correct  for  multiple  comparisons:  A  Monte  Carlo  simulation  with  10,000  iterations  indicated that  a  false  positive  probability  of  0.05  (i.e.  95%  conﬁdence)  was achieved  when  implementing  the  condition  that  a  cluster  of  at least  27  contiguous  voxels  displays  an  effect  with  p  <  0.005.  In  order to  limit  further  the  potential  for  Type  I  error,  testing  of  a-priori hypotheses  were  limited  to  two  comparisons  of  neural  activity and  1)  the  single  CpG2  III  of  interest  as  well  as  2)  maternal  IPVPTSD  severity.  Whole  brain  correlations  of  maternal  brain  activity with  CpGs  other  than  CpG2  III  can  be  found  in  the  Supplementary materials  and  are  only  given  for  the  sake  of  completeness.  ×   3  mm   3.1.  Characteristics  of  participants  Comparison  of  IPV-PTSD  mothers  (n  =  18)  and  non-PTSD  mothers  (n  =  17)  via  independent  t-tests  indicated  no  differences  for maternal  age,  child  age  or  gender.  The  socio-economic  status (SES)  of  IPV-PTSD  mothers  was   however  signiﬁcantly  lower  than non-PTSD  controls  (see  Table  1).  When  we   performed  Spearman correlations  looking  at  the  association  of  maternal  PTSD  to  1) maternal  experience  of  IPV  in  terms  of  number  of  violent  life  events on  the  BPSAQ  and  TLEQ  and  to  2)  severity  of  adult  partner  violence  (i.e.  subscale  score)  on  the  CTS-2,  while  co-varying  SES,  these correlations  remained  highly  signiﬁcant.  (see  Supplementary  Table S1)  We  then  examined  group  differences  in  terms  of  adverse  life events  exposure  also  using  independent  t-tests  (see  Fig.  1  and  Supplementary  Table  S2.)  As  expected,  the  IPV-PTSD  group  of  mothers has  signiﬁcantly  higher  rates  of  physical  and  sexual  abuse  and exposure  to  domestic  violence  as  children,  as  well  as  exposure  to physical  and/or  sexual  violence  as  adults.  The  majority  of  mothers  with  adult  exposure  were  physically  abused  (61%,  likelihood ratio  =  11.36,  p   ≤   0.05).  Differences  between  groups  were  signiﬁcant  in  terms  of  the number  of  violent  events  experienced  across  the  mothers’  lifetime, and  by  deﬁnition,  maternal  IPV-PTSD,  but  also  major  depressive  symptom  severity.  There  was   no  signiﬁcant  group  difference, however,  for  maternal  aggressive  behavior  (see  Table  2a).  Nonparametric  (Spearman)  correlations  showing  similarly  signiﬁcant relationships  between  the  number  of  violent  life  events  across the  mothers’  lifetime  and  related  PTSD  with  severity  of  maternal  depressive  symptoms,  maternal  aggression  and  child  SBD  are shown  in  the  Supplementary  materials  (See  Supplementary  Table S3).  Comparison  of  IPV-PTSD  and  non-PTSD  mothers  with  respect to  continuous  child  psychopathology  measures  yielded  signiﬁcant results.  Maternal  IPV-PTSD  was  associated  with  the  Secure  Base Distortion  subscale  and  in  particular,  three  component  behaviors, self-endangering  behavior,  separation  anxiety,  and  hypervigilance on  the  Disturbances  of  Attachment  Interview  (DAI)  when  children were  ages  12–42  months  (Time  1).  3.2.  HTR3A  gene  methylation  at  CpG2  III  We  then  examined  group  differences  by  independent  t-tests  for methylation  of  the  seven  5-HTR3A  CpGs  studied  (see  Table  2b).  IPVPTSD  mothers  were  characterized  by  a  signiﬁcantly  lower  mean percentage  of  methylation  of  the  HTR3A  gene  promoter  region  at two  of  the  CpG  sites  in  the  promoter  region:  2  III  and  3  III  and  a  signiﬁcantly  higher  mean  percentage  of  methylation  in  the  two  CpGs located  in  the  coding  region:  4  III  and  5  III.  Based  on  our  ﬁrst  and  second  a-priori  hypotheses  relative  to methylation  in  the  gene’s  promoter  region  (see  Section  1.4),  we  performed  comparisons  using  Spearman  correlation  of  5  key  measures (see  Table  3):  number  of  violent  events  experienced  by  mothers  in their  lifetime  from  the  TLEQ,  maternal  PTSD  severity  from  the  CAPS, maternal  major  depression  symptom  severity  on  the  Beck  Depression  Inventory  II  (BDI-II),  maternal  aggression  on  the  CTS-2,  and the  child  attachment  disturbance  “secure  base  distortion”  on  the DAI,  with  its  4  component  behaviors.  Of  note,  HTR3A  methylation at  CpGs  2  III  and  3  III  was  signiﬁcantly  associated  after  Bonferroni testing  with  maternal  lifetime  violence  exposure,  lifetime  IPV-PTSD severity,  maternal  aggression  and  child  self-endangering  behavior on  the  DAI.  We  additionally  looked  post-hoc  speciﬁcally  at  the  relationships of  child  physical  and  sexual  abuse  on  the  BPSAQ  with  methylation  272   D.S.

Discussion  4.1.  Convergent  associations  between  maternal  5HT3aR methylation,  trauma  history,  psychopathology,  and  neural  activity  Results  of  this  study  have  shown  signiﬁcant  and  convergent associations  between  the  mean  percentage  of  methylation  of  the promoter  region  of  the  HTR3A  gene  in  salivary  DNA  and  the following  key  variables:  maternal  history  of  exposure  to  childhood  maltreatment  and  subsequent  violent  victimization,  related IPV-PTSD,  maternal  aggressive  behavior  and  child  attachment  disturbance  of  the  secure  base  distortion  type  and  in  particular  one  of its  cardinal  signs,  self-endangering  behavior.  The  peripheral  level of  HTR3A  methylation  despite  its  unknown  relationship  to  central nervous  system  levels  of  methylation,  may   thus  represent  a  marker for  a  maternal  IPV-PTSD  endophenotype  that  confers  risk  to  the mother-child  relationship  and  the  child’s  social-emotional  development.  These  converging  results  were  most  signiﬁcantly  found  to involve  less  methylation  at  one  particular  CpG  site  in  the  HTR3A gene’s  promoter  region  CpG  2  III  which  was  identiﬁed  as  being associated  with  child  maltreatment  in  a  previous  study  by  Perroud et  al.  that  also  used  peripheral  DNA  (i.e.  blood)  [29].  The  fact  that this  CpG  site  is  located  only  1  base-pair  distance  from  a  functional single-nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  RS1062613,  which  has  been previously  linked  to  early  adverse  experience  [25]  provides  insights into  how  genetic  and  epigenetic  factors  may   interact  to  regulate HTR3A  expression.  In  addition,  in  vitro  gel  shift  assays  indicate  that allele-speciﬁc  methylation  of  CpG2  III  increases  the  binding  of  the transcription  factor  CTFC  to  the  promoter  region  of  HTR3A  [45]. Furthermore,  in  silico  molecular  dynamic  simulation  shows  that binding  of  CTCF  to  the  methylated  CpG2  III  site  of  the  HTR3A  allele is  stronger  and  more  stable  compared  to  the  un-methylated  condition  [45].  At  a  functional  level,  increased  CTCF  binding  to  HTR3A has  been  suggested  to  repress  transcription  [45].  These  results  suggest  that  in  PTSD,  de-methylation  of  CpG2  III  may   decrease  binding of  CTCF  to  the  HTR3A  allele  and  possibly  increase  transcription. Although  the  functional  consequences  of  CTCF  binding  to  HT3AR remain  to  be  clearly  established,  the  present  study  further  points to  the  clinical  importance  of  CpG2  III,  by  showing  a  signiﬁcant  association  between  methylation  at  CpG  2  III  and  maternal  IPV-PTSD. The  speciﬁcity  of  this  association  is  supported  by  the  observation that  HTR3A  methylation  at  CpG  2  III  was  not  signiﬁcantly  associated with  maternal  major  depressive  symptoms.  The  above  described  convergent  associations  implicating  the CpG  2  III  site  were  also  found  to  be  linked  to  maternal  neural activity  in  cortical  brain  regions  involved  in  emotion  and  arousal regulation.  Interestingly,  HTR3A  methylation  at  CpG  2  III  was   associated  to  neural  activity  in  the  dmPFC  in  response  to  silent  video stimuli  depicting  adult  men   behaving  in  a  physically  menacing manner  towards  adult  women  as  compared  to  a  prosocial  or  emo tionally  neutral  manner.  These  neuroimaging  ﬁndings  extend  our previous  studies,  in  which  dmPFC  as  well  as  vmPFC  activity  in response  to  this  same  silent  video  paradigm  were  found  to  be  negatively  and  signiﬁcantly  associated  with  maternal  IPV-PTSD  severity [18].  Moreover,  neural  activity  in  these  same  mPFC  regions  in response  to  parenting  speciﬁc  stimuli  (i.e.  silent  video  clips  of  own and  unfamiliar  toddlers  in  separation  versus  play)  have  also  been found  to  be  signiﬁcantly  associated  both  to  peripheral  measures  of glucocorticoid  receptor  gene  NR3C1  promoter  region  and  to  maternal  IPV-PTSD  severity  [31].  Additionally,  dlPFC  and  vmPFC  activity have  been  associated  both  to  observed  maternal  sensitivity  [47] and  maternal  methylation  of  the  BDNF  gene  promoter  region  [48]. Overall,  The  present  paper  further  suggests  that  the  combination  of peripheral  HTR3A  gene  methylation  signatures  that  are  associated with  relevant  functional  brain  activity  in  key  cortico-limbic  regions is  a  useful  approach  to  begin  delineating  the  maternal  endophenotypes  of  IPV-PTSD  as  distinct  from  other  forms  of  psychopathology. Indeed,  some  important  differences  from  the  Perroud  et  al.  [29] study,  which  are  related  to  this  distinction,  are  worthy  of  mention. Firstly,  Perroud’s  study  did  not  consider  PTSD  or  neural  activity. Secondly,  while  methylation  of  the  promoter  region  of  the  HTR3A gene  was   negatively  associated  with  the  number  of  interpersonal violent  (IPV)  events  to  which  the  mother  had  been  exposed  since childhood-  and  on  post-hoc  analyses,  the  presence  and  severity of  adult  physical  and  sexual  assault  including  domestic  violence to  which  most  of  the  mothers  with  PTSD  in  this  particular  sample  were  exposed,  this  gene  was   not  speciﬁcally  associated  with child  physical  abuse  as  it  had  been  in  that  previous  study  [29]. That  being  said,  60%  of  the  mothers  who  had  experienced  interpersonal  violence  as  adults  had  experienced  physical  abuse  as  children. Although,  an  association  with  child  sexual  abuse  fell  short  of  signiﬁcance  (p  =  0.14).  Thus,  negative  ﬁndings  with  respect  to  child physical  and  sexual  abuse  may   be  a  result  of  the  limited  sample size.  Furthermore,  whereas  Perroud’s  study  [29]  found  increased methylation  to  be  associated  with  child  maltreatment,  greater severity  of  suicide  attempts,  number  of  hospitalizations,  and  mood disorder  episodes,  the  present  study  found  that  decreased  methylation  was   associated  with  maternal  history  of  violent  trauma,  related PTSD  diagnosis  and  severity,  relational  aggression,  and  less  activation  in  the  dmPFC.  The  explanation  for  these  differences  may   lie  in the  fundamental  difference  in  the  pathophysiology  of  PTSD  versus major  depressive  disorder  [32,33],  which  we  similarly  asserted  was responsible  for  the  difference  of  direction  of  methylation  effect in  the  instance  of  the  relationship  of  NR3C1  and  its  associations with  maternal  IPV-PTSD,  parenting  stress,  and  neural  activity  in the  mPFC  [31].  Nevertheless,  these  are  but  two   studies  that  require replication  with  larger  samples  that  include  subjects  suffering  from PTSD,  mood  disorder,  and  their  comorbidity.  4.2.  Interpreting  the  link  of  maternal  ﬁndings  to  child  attachment disturbance  and  self-endangering  behavior  Methylation  of  the  HTR3A  receptor  promoter  region,  particularly  at  the  functional  site  CpG2  III  was   negatively  correlated with  maternal  verbal  and  physical  aggression  as  measured  on  the Conﬂict  Tactics  Scale-2  (CTS2),  a  measure  which  looks  at  how  interpersonal  conﬂicts  are  treated  in  adult  romantic  relationships.  In the  context  of  IPV,  maternal  caregiving  is  more  unpredictable,  with less  availability  to  the  child  for  mutual  emotion  regulation  of  emotion  and  arousal  during  sensitive  periods  of  emotional  development [43].  Interestingly,  on  a  clinician  rated  measure,  the  DAI,  that  employs child-parent  observation,  child  attachment  disturbance  in  the  form of  Secure  Base  Distortion  (SBD)  was  linked  to  less  methylation  of the  HTR3A  promoter  region.  Maternal  IPV-PTSD  has  been  indeed  276   D.S.  Schechter  et  al.  /  Behavioural  Brain  Research  325  (2017)  268–277  directly  associated  with  SBD  in  a  prior  study  [43].  SBD  consists  of four  symptoms  that  clinicians  can  rate  on  the  DAI  [49]:  namely, separation  anxiety,  self-endangering  behavior,  hypervigilance  and role  reversal  [43].  We   noted  in  this  study  that  the  self-endangering behavior  item  individually,  while  not  signiﬁcantly  associated  with maternal  PTSD,  was  strongly  and  negatively  correlated  with  less methylation  of  the  maternal  HTR3A  particularly  at  CpG  2  III  and CpG  3  III  (see  Table  4  and  Supplementary  Table  S7).  And  in  turn, we  found  that  self-endangering  behavior  was  strongly  associated with  child  aggressive  behavior  on  a  standard  parental  report  measure  one  year  later  for  the  30  out  of  the  35  children  whose  mother’s completed  the  questionnaire.  Together,  two  indicators  of  reduced maternal  emotional  regulation  capacities:  namely,  methylation  of the  maternal  HTR3A  receptor  at  CpGs  2  III  and  reduced  maternal dmPFC  activation,  accounted  for  nearly  one-third  of  the  variance  of child  self-endangering  behavior  in  the  applied  multiple  regression analysis.  It  might  be  the  case  that  in  the  absence  of  a  predictable primary  attachment  ﬁgure  and  role-model  for  mutual  emotion regulation  during  sensitive  periods  of  early  social-emotional  development,  the  toddler  can  develop  an  attachment  disturbance  that  is characterized  by  emotional  dysregulation,  impulse  dyscontrol,  and self-endangering  behavior.  Further  study  that  would  include  child HTR3A  methylation  is  needed  to  clarify  whether  the  epigenetic  signature  of  HTR3A  as  observed  in  this  sample  might  be  a  marker  of  a more  aggressive  and  self-endangering  child  endophenotype  in  this context.  4.3.  Limitations  This  study  was  clearly  limited  by  a  small  sample  size  especially  given  1)  limited  amount  of  good  quality  salivary  DNA  for pyrosequencing  2)  constraining  the  sample  only  to  mothers  who had  a)  consented  to  participate  in  MRI   scanning  and  b)  who  had complete  and  adequate  MRI   data.  Moreover,  child  salivary  DNA was  not  available  for  pyrosequencing.  Another  clear  limitation  is the  use  of  peripheral  salivary  DNA  from  which  methylation  levels  in  brain  cells  cannot  be  inferred.  And  thus,  in  this  paper,  the authors  have  restricted  their  interpretation  of  the  ﬁndings  to  suggest  a  possible  peripheral  biomarker  of  a  maternal  endophenotype characterized  by  heightened  aggression  in  the  context  of  maternal IPV-PTSD.  The  data  do  not  permit  any  causal  inference  concerning the  relationship  between  maternal  peripheral  HTR3A  methylation and  neural  activity  or  between  either  of  these  two  variables  and maternal-child  symptoms  and  behavior.  In  the  rodent  brain,  the HTR3AR  has  been  shown  to  be  speciﬁcally  expressed  in  a  subset  of  inhibitory  GABAergic  interneurons  located  in  a  variety  of brain  regions,  including  the  mPFC,  hippocampus  and  amygdala [20,21,23].  Whether  early-life  adversity  affects  the  methylation  status  of  the  HTR3A  receptor  in  this  subset  of  GABAergic  interneurons remains  to  be  tested  in  rodent  models  of  early-life  stress.  Furthermore,  the  impact  of  stress-induced  HTR3A  methylation  changes  on the  expression  levels  of  the  HTR3A  transcript  remains  to  be  determined.  In  a  broader  perspective  and  in  relationship  with  PTSD,  the HTR3A  receptor  has  been  shown  to  be  required  for  fear  extinction.  Indeed,  mice  with  a  constitutive  genetic  deletion  of  the  HTR3A receptor  fail  to  normally  extinguish  conditioned  fear  responses [24].  Given  the  critical  role  of  the  mPFC  in  controlling  fear  extinction  [50],  the  precise  circuit  mechanisms  through  which  the  HTR3A receptor  regulates  fear  extinction  in  the  mPFC  remain  to  be  established.  Overall,  our  data  indicate  that  mPFC  neural  activity  and peripheral  blood  HTR3A  receptor  methylation  status  are  linked. However,  much  work  remains  to  be  done  to  understand  the  role  of the  HTR3A  receptor  in  mPFC  microcircuit  function  in  PTSD-related models.  The  use  of  retrospective  measures  to  evaluate  childhood  abuse and  violence  exposure  history  is  another  potential  limitation.  Recent  studies  on  potential  retrospective  reporting  bias  concerning childhood  adverse  experiences  have  found,  however,  that  retrospective  reports  tend  to  be  at  least  moderately  reliable  when reliable  life-events  measures  are  used  as  was  the  case  in  the present  study  [51,52].  A  further  limitation  was  the  absence  of  a clinician-rated  child  diagnostic  measure  apart  from  the  DAI  to look  at  additional  psychiatric  diagnoses  and,  in  particular  aggressive  behavior  at  the  time  of  the  initial  evaluations  and  then again,  one  year  later.  Finally,  while  several  important  associations remained  signiﬁcant  even  after  correction  for  multiple  comparisons  (i.e.  HTR3A  methylation  being  inversely  related  both  to maternal  IPV-PTSD  diagnosis  and  symptom  severity  as  well  as  to child  self-endangering  behavior  on  the  DAI  and  to  decreased  neural activity  in  the  maternal  dmPFC  in  response  to  relational  stimuli), given  the  small  sample  size,  several  other  associations  related  to our  a-priori  hypotheses  did  not  survive  the  Bonferroni  correction. This  again  suggests  the  need  for  replication  of  this  study  within  a larger  sample.  4.4.  Conclusions  In  conclusion,  this  paper  supports  the  notion  that  violent  trauma beginning  in  infancy  and  early  childhood  leaves  an  epigenetic signature  on  a  serotonin  receptor  gene  that  has  been  shown to  be  implicated  in  the  regulation  of  emotion  and  aggression, namely,  HTR3A.   This  peripheral  epigenetic  signature  among  mothers  of  very  young  children  corresponds  to  a  number  of  maternal psychopathology,  behavior,  and  neural  activity  measures  that,  similarly,  are  implicit  to  the  regulation  of  emotion  and  aggression. And  as  such,  the  signiﬁcant  association  of  HTR3A  methylation  with the  child  attachment  disturbance  SBD,  as  marked  by  child  selfendangering  behavior  is  particularly  intriguing.  Further  research is  needed  to  understand  if  methylation  of  the  HTR3A  gene  promoter  region  particularly  at  the  functional  CpG  2  III  site  reﬂects a  potentially  aggressive,  impulse-disinhibited  (versus  anxious, impulse-inhibited)  maternal  endophenotype  that  might  impact  the intergenerational  transmission  of  violent  trauma.

This  translational  circuit—the  aversive  ampliﬁ cation  circuit—is  thought  to  drive  adaptive,  harm-avoidant  behaviour  in  threatening environments. We assess the role of this circuit in the pathological manifestation of anxiety disorders.  Methods For this single-site study, 45 unmedicated participants (22 with generalised and/or social anxiety disorder and  23 healthy controls) were recruited via advertisements from the metropolitan area of Washington, DC (USA). People who  applied to participate in the study had to pass an initial telephone screen and comprehensive screening by a clinician at  the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA). People with a contraindicated medical disorder, past or  current psychiatric disorders other than anxiety disorders, and those using psychoactive medications or illicit drugs were  excluded. Eligible individuals could participate as either a healthy control or a patient, depending on diagnosis. They were  asked to use a button box to complete a simple emotion identiﬁ cation task (fearful vs happy faces; 44 trials of each)  during  functional  MRI  at  the  NIH.  Functional  imaging  analysis  consisted  of  event-related  activation  analysis  and  psychophysiological interaction connectivity analysis of regions coupled with the amygdala during task performance.  Findings  A  diagnosis-by-valence  interaction  was  recorded  in  whole-brain  amygdala  connectivity  within  the  dorsal  medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex clusters identiﬁ ed in our previous study, driven by signiﬁ cantly increased  circuit  coupling  during  processing  of  fearful  faces  versus  happy  faces  in  anxious,  but  not  healthy,  participants.  Importantly, and in accordance with contemporary theoretical approaches to psychiatry, circuit coupling correlated  positively with self-reported anxious symptoms, which provides evidence of a continuous association between the  circuit and subjective symptoms.  Interpretation  In  this  study  and  our  previous  work,  we  track  the  functional  role  of  one  neural  circuit  from  its  involvement in adaptive threat biases under stress, to its chronic engagement in anxiety disorders in the absence of  experimentally  induced  stress.  Thus,  we  uniquely  map  a  mood  and  anxiety-related  circuit  across  its  adaptive  and  maladaptive stages. Clinically, this study could provide a step towards a more mechanistic continuum-based approach  to anxiety disorder diagnosis and might ultimately lead to more targeted treatments for patients with anxiety disorders.

Introduction Pathological  anxiety  is  a  large  and  increasing  global  health  problem.1  People  with  the  disorder  go  through  periods  of  crippling  anxiety  that  adversely  aﬀ ect  their  daily lives. One of the key contributing symptoms is a  persistent  and  debilitating  focus  upon  negative  or  potentially  threatening  life  experiences.1  This  negative  aﬀ ective  bias  can  be  experimentally  quantiﬁ ed  as  increased threat processing at the neural, psychological,  and behavioural levels.1   However,  anxiety  can  also  be  an  adaptive  process  that  improves  an  individual’s  ability  to  avoid  harm.  Indeed,  negative  aﬀ ective  biases  towards  threats  are  recorded  in  healthy  people  experiencing  transient   anxiety  or  stress.1  The  adaptive  and  maladaptive  anxiety-driven  negative  aﬀ ective  biases  might  be  linked,  perhaps  falling  at  opposite  ends  of  the  same  scale. Such an association would have implications for  how  we  diagnose  and  treat  these  disorders,  but  evidence  is  scarce  at  present.  This  study  therefore  extends  four  of  our  previous  studies  mapping  the  circuit-based  interactions  between  the  dorsal  medial  prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex and the amygdala  during  adaptive  threat  processing  in  stressed  healthy  people to address pathological anxiety.  The role of the amygdala in threat processing is well  known,2–4  but  the  various  regions  of  the  brain  do  not  respond  in  isolation—rather,  they  constitute  nodes  in   294   www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 1  September 2014  Articles  For regions of interest see  http://ﬁ gshare.com/authors/ Oliver_Robinson/568652  complex neural circuits.5,6 Our recent work has therefore  begun to outline how interactions between the amygdala  and  higher  cortical  regions  contribute  towards  threatprocessing biases. In particular, our work suggests that  interactions  between  the  dorsal  medial  prefrontal  (anterior  cingulate)  cortex  and  amygdala  constitute  an  aversive-ampliﬁ cation circuit whereby increased positive  coupling  between  these  regions  is  associated  with  increased threat processing under stress.7–9 Notably, this  role,  derived  from  translational  animal  research,10  is  thought  to  be  distinct  from  a  more  frequently  studied  reciprocal, opposing inhibitory role11,12 of adjacent ventral  (and subgenual) regions of the prefrontal and cingulate  cortex (discussed in more detail elsewhere13–15).  Speciﬁ cally,  we  have  shown  that  stress  induced  by  a  threat of shock in healthy people (a manipulation in which  participants are told they might potentially receive a shock  and  that  reliably  increases  psychological,  physiological,  cognitive,  and  neural  concomitants  of  stress1)  drives  increased attentional bias (in a face emotion identiﬁ cation  task)  to  fearful  faces16  as  a  function  of  increased  positive  functional  connectivity  between  the  dorsal  medial  prefrontal  (anterior  cingulate)  cortex  and  the  amygdala  (ﬁ gure 1).7 Second, we have replicated this ﬁ nding using a  diﬀ erent technique, task-independent resting state fMRI;  enhanced positive endogenous connectivity (ie, oscillatory  connectivity during rest periods with no task) is recorded  between the dorsal medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate)  cortex  and  the  amygdala  during  prolonged  periods  of  threat  of  shock  in  an  adapted  resting-state  paradigm  in  healthy participants.9 Third, we have shown that threat of  shock leads to cognitive disturbances in working memory  in healthy people1 that are also associated with increased  coupling within this circuit (Vytal K, unpublished). Finally,  we  have  reported  that  mimicking  a  pharmacological  symptom  of  anxiety  in  healthy  individuals—reduced  serotonergic  function—engages  functional  connectivity  within this same circuit during processing of fearful faces.8  This fourth study provides a putative mechanism by which  selective  serotonergic  reuptake  inhibitor  drugs  might,  through modulation of this circuit, alleviate anxiety.8  Thus, we have comprehensively mapped the workings  of this circuit in healthy people. Therefore, the main goal  of the present study is to provide experimental evidence  that  this  functionally  mapped  circuit  might  have  a  key  role  in  pathological  anxiety  disorders.  Previous  work  focusing  on  threat  processing  in  anxiety  disorders  has  shown  abnormal  activity  in  regions  of  the  prefrontal  cingulate  cortex  and  the  amygdala.17–19  However,  studies  so far have mostly assessed individual region activations  (ie, the change in the activity of a region in one condition  vs  another),  and  not  circuitry  (ie,  the  extent  to  which  activity correlates between two regions in one condition  vs another). Correlation between regions is thought to at  least partly represent ﬂ ow of information between them,  and can be seen in the absence of activation changes (for  more  details,  see  elsewhere20).  Such  between-region   Figure 1: Regions of interest derived from our study using threat of shock as  a stress induction in healthy participants7 Both a posterior cluster encompassing dorsal anterior cingulate and medial  prefrontal cortex (dorsal region highlighted in dark pink) and a rostral cluster in  the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (rostral region highlighted in green ) showed  increased positive connectivity with the amygdala during the processing of  fearful faces under stress and were used to create regions of interest for the  present study. These regions of interest are freely available to download online.  interactions therefore provide better insight into the way  these regions act as a circuit.  Psychiatric disorders are increasingly recognised to be  unlikely to fall within the categorical (ie, healthy/unwell)  diagnoses  of  existing  diagnostic  criteria,  but  rather  lie  along  a  scale  from  more  “normal”  to  more  “impaired”  function (for more details, see elsewhere21). Our previous  studies  showed  that  activation  of  the  dorsal  medial  prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex and amygdala circuit  falls along a continuous dimension as a function of trait  anxiety  symptoms,7,9  with  increased  trait  feelings  of  anxiety (a vulnerability factor for anxiety disorders) being  associated  with  greater  positive  coupling  within  this  circuit.  This  ﬁ nding  generates  a  secondary  prediction:  pathological  anxiety  symptoms  will  also  fall  along  this  continuum. This theory suggests that anxiety symptoms  that are severe enough to interfere with daily living should  be associated with even more circuit engagement along  the same dimensional index. Such a ﬁ nding would, from  a clinical perspective, help to refocus our understanding  of  anxiety  disorders  away  from  discrete  diagnoses  and  towards more of a range or scale.  Methods Study design and participants We did this single-site study at the National Institutes of  Health  (NIH)  Clinical  Center  in  Bethesda  (MD,  USA).

Following an initial telephone screen, participants  visited  the  NIH  for  comprehensive  screening  by  a  clinician,  which  comprised  a  physical  examination,  urine screen, and a Structured Clinical Interview [SCID]  from  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  [DSM],  Fourth  Edition.22  Exclusion  criteria  were: contraindicated medical disorder; past or current  psychiatric  disorders  other  than  anxiety  disorders;  and  use of psychoactive medications or illicit drugs (as tested  by the urine screen). People who passed this screening  stage were given the option to participate in the study as  either a healthy control or a patient (depending on their  diagnosis).  Participants  completed  measures  of  anxiety  (State-Trait  Anxiety  Inventory  [STAI]23,24),  depression  (Beck  Depression  Inventory  [BDI]24),  and  intelligence  quotient  (Wechsler  Abbreviated  Scale  of  Intelligence  [WASI]25).  Five  patients  were  excluded  because  of  scan  acquisition artifacts (eg, caused by extreme movements  or  scanner  malfunction);  therefore,  the  ﬁ nal  sample  consisted  of  45  unmedicated  people,  22  of  whom  were  suﬀ ering  from  a  current  anxiety  disorder.  15  of  these  patients  had  a  generalised  anxiety  disorder,  of  which  nine were comorbid with a secondary diagnosis of social  anxiety disorder; and seven had a social anxiety disorder.  23 healthy controls also participated. In the patients with  anxiety  disorders,  the  mean  estimated  illness  duration  was 16 (SD 8) years. Seven patients had received previous  pharmacological treatment, which had been discontinued  (>10 years ago [n=5], >6 months ago [n=1], or >2 months  ago  [n=1]).  Unmedicated  status  was  necessary  to  avoid  potential  drug-linked  vascular  confounders.  Patients  and  healthy  controls  were  matched  for  demographic  variables  (table  1).  All  participants  provided  written  informed  consent  that  was  approved  by  the  Combined  Neuroscience Institutional Review Board of the NIH.  Procedures For their task in this study, participants were asked to  use a button box to identify whether faces16 were fearful   or happy. The task consisted of 88 trials (44 fearful faces  and 44 happy faces) with 2000–4000 ms jitter between  the trials. Each stimulus was presented for 990 ms and  30 s of ﬁ xation was presented at the start and end of the  task.  This  task  is  the  same  as  that  used  previously  in  healthy  controls7  but  without  the  concurrent  threat  of  shock stress manipulation used in that previous study.  Participants  were  asked  to  respond  as  quickly  as  possible using a button box placed upon their abdomen  in  the  scanner.  The  task  was  projected  on  a  screen  to  the  rear  of  the  scanner,  visible  by  means  of  a  mirror  attached to the head coil (an integral component of the  fMRI scanner).  We  used  a  3T  Skyra  scanner  (Siemens,  Malvern,  PA,  USA) to acquire one 207 volume acquisition echo planar  imaging  (EPI)  sequence  (ﬂ ip  angle  70°;  repetition  time  [TR] 2000 ms; echo time [TE] 30 ms; ﬁ eld of view [FOV]  100  cm;  slice  thickness  3  mm;  matrix  64 × 64  samples  sagittal).  We  discarded  the  ﬁ rst  ﬁ ve  volumes  from  each  run  to  allow  for  scanner  equilibration.  The  structural  sequence  comprised  a  magnetisation-prepared  rapid  gradient  echo  anatomical  reference  image  (ﬂ ip  angle  9°;  TR 1900 ms; TE 2·1; inversion time 450 ms; FOV 100 cm;  slice thickness 0·9 mm; matrix 256 × 256). We preprocessed  and analysed images using SPM version 8. SPM refers to  the “conjoint use of the general linear model (GLM) and  Gaussian random ﬁ eld (GRF) theory to analyse and make  classical inferences about spatially extended data through  statistical  parametric  maps  (SPMs)”  (for  SPM  software  information, see online).  Statistical analysis  Our analyses consisted of ﬁ ve well-established steps, the  ﬁ rst of which was preprocessing to transform the bloodoxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal acquired during  scanning into the same standardised space across time  and  across  all  participants.  Step  two  was  statistical  activation  analysis  to  generate  BOLD  signal  activation  estimates for each trial type (fearful vs happy faces) for  each  participant  (ﬁ rst-level  event-related  analysis  with  use of mass univariate general linear models). The third  step  was  statistical  connectivity  analysis  to  estimate  which  regions  across  the  whole  brain  are  signiﬁ cantly  associated  with  the  BOLD  activity  recorded  in  the  amygdala during each trial type (a psychophysiological  interaction  analysis).  Fourth  was  a  group-level  analysis  in which summary estimates of activation or connectivity  for each participant are compared across groups (secondlevel  analysis  with t  tests).  The  ﬁ fth  step  was  a  grouplevel  continuous  variable  analysis  in  which  summary  estimates of activation or connectivity for each participant  are  correlated  with  individual  diﬀ erence  measures  (eg,  trait personality scales or mean reaction times).  Preprocessing  consisted  of  within -participant  realignment,  coregistration,  segmentation,  normalisation,  and  smoothing (with a Gaussian kernel 8 mm full width at  half maximum). In an event-related analysis, we used a   296   www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 1  September 2014  Articles  Anxiety disorder     For eigenvariate summary see  http://www.ﬁ l.ion.ucl.ac.uk/ spm/doc.intro  0·5  0·4  0·3  0·2  0·1  0  –0·1  –0·2  –0·3  –0·4  –0·5  Healthy control  A  B  ) s a t e b (   y t i v i t c e n n o c e c a f   y p p a h   s v e c a f   l        u f r a e F  Figure 2: Categorical analysis (A) A whole-brain diagnosis-by-valence interaction in dorsal anterior cingulate  cortex–amygdala connectivity was recorded with yellow areas indicating  increased circuit activity during observation of fearful versus happy faces in  patients.

Activations that fall  within these regions in the group analyses of the present  study can be said to overlap with the activation in our  previous study.   We  report  Montreal  Neurological  Institute  (MNI)  standardised coordinates28 (denoted as x,y,z). For additional  corroboration, we extracted the activation and connectivity  estimates (betas) from the peak voxel (x,y,z=2,2,40) from  our previous study. We then analysed these extracted betas  using general linear models in SPSS version 22.  We  did  continuous  variable  functional  MRI  analyses  by separately correlating STAI trait anxiety24 (measured  on  the  day  of  testing)  and  behavioural  bias  (fearful  minus happy reaction times) with the fearful face versus  happy  face  connectivity  estimates  derived  from  the  connectivity analysis. This analysis therefore asks, across  the whole sample or within groups, which connectivity  estimates  (across  the  whole  brain)  are  signiﬁ cantly  associated with the bias or trait anxiety variables?  For ROIs see http://ﬁ gshare.com/ authors/Oliver_Robinson/568652  general linear model to estimate the BOLD signal change  associated  with  the  onset  times  of  each  face  valence  (fearful or happy). We also included motion parameters  created  during  the  realignment  phase  as  nuisance  regressors in this model (to account for noise associated  with participant movement). This process was repeated  for  each  participant  and  asks:  what  is  the  BOLD  signal  change associated with fearful and happy faces?   We  then  created  a  generalised  psychophysiological  interaction general linear model for each participant in  the  same  manner  as  in  our  previous  studies7,8  (which  were distinct studies for which the sample populations  were  recruited  separately).  Speciﬁ cally,  we  used  SPM8  code to generate the following regressors from the eventrelated model described above: an eigenvariate summary  of BOLD signal localised within spatial conﬁ nes of the  amygdala seed used in our previous study7 (an anatomical  region  of  interest  [ROI]  deﬁ ned  by  an  automated  anatomical  labelling  library26)  across  time;  separate  psychological regressors representing the onsets of each  happy face and each fearful face; and psychophysiological  interaction  terms  representing  the  interaction  between  the ﬁ rst two regressors. Next, we created a general linear  model  for  each  participant  in  which  we  included  one  regressor  representing  a  deconvolved  BOLD  signal  alongside  each  psychological  and  psychophysiological  interaction  term  for  each  event  type.  This  model  therefore asks: for each participant, which regions of the  brain show a BOLD signal that is signiﬁ cantly associated  with that of the amygdala during the events of interest  (fearful or happy)? This is the circuit-coupling measure  that we are interested in.   For  each  participant,  we  then  created  a  contrast  representing the regions across the whole brain that were  more  strongly  related  with  the  amygdala  during  fearful  face  processing  than  during  happy  face  processing  (ie,  fearful  vs  happy  contrast).  We  compared  these  withinparticipant contrasts at the group level in a standard SPM8  two-sample  (healthy  vs  anxious)  t  test.  This  analysis  provided us with an estimate of regions, across the whole  brain, that showed greater correlation with the amygdala  in anxious patients than in healthy controls during fearful  (compared with happy) face processing (ie, a diagnosis-by-  valence  interaction).  We  did  similar  analyses  for  eventrelated activations of each trial versus baseline.   To  directly  compare  cross-study  activation  with  our  previous  study,  we  created  a  priori  ROIs  from  the  clusters in our ﬁ rst study7 (ﬁ gure 1) using the “get SPM  cluster” function of the MARSBAR toolbox for SPM8.27  These clusters were generated at a threshold of p<0·001  (uncorrected)  in  our  previous  data  from  the  withinparticipant,  whole-brain  threat-by-valence  interaction  map generated by use of the ﬂ exible factorial model in  SPM8  (for  more  details,  see  the  original  report27  or  download  the  ROIs  from  the  internet).

Analyses of this connectivity with use of  an  ROI  generated  from  the  largest  ROI  cluster  (dorsal)  from  our  previous  study  (ﬁ gure  1)  showed  signiﬁ cant  overlap across studies (peak x,y,z=4,–8,32; t=4·43; p[FWE  corrected]=0·001). We recorded the same pattern at a nonsigniﬁ cant threshold in an ROI generated from the rostral  cluster (peak x,y,z=14,40,42; t=3·44; p[uncorrected]<0·0006). Breakdown  of  this  interaction  into  groups  (control/ patient)  and  valence  (fear/happy)  showed  a  signiﬁ cant  a  priori  increase  in  fear  versus  happy  activation  in  anxious  patients  (dorsal:  peak  x,y,z=14,4,36;  t=4·0;  p[uncorrected]=0·0008),  but  not  in  healthy  controls  (dorsal:  p[uncorrected]>0·15).  Betas  extracted  from  the  peak  voxel  from  our  previous  study  (x,y,z=2,2,40)  for  illustrative  purposes  showed  that  this  diagnosis-byvalence  interaction  (F[degrees  of  freedom  1,43]=5·3,  p=0·03;  ﬁ gure  2B)  was  driven  by  increased  coupling  during the processing of fearful faces versus happy faces  in  patients  with  anxiety  disorders  (t[21]=2·2,  p=0·039),  but not healthy controls (p=0·2).   This  fear  versus  happy  connectivity  increased  as  a  function  of  trait  anxiety  along  a  continuum  across  the  sample as a whole (whole-brain peak in the dorsal medial  prefrontal  cortex  x,y,z=14,–8,52,  t=5·09,  p[FWE–cluster  level]=0·0002; dorsal ROI p[FWE–cluster level]=0·0023);  rostral ROI p[uncorrected]=0·001)), but crucially—since  this  is  confounded  by  group  eﬀ ects—saw  a  correlation  with trait anxiety in the patient group alone (dorsal peak  x,y,z=–8,10,30, t=4·6, p[uncorrected]<0·0001) (ﬁ gure 3A).  Moreover,  we  recorded  no  correlations  with  depression  ratings (on the BDI) across the whole group or within the  patients  with  anxiety  disorders  alone  (all  p>0·2),  which  indicates that this eﬀ ect was speciﬁ c to anxiety symptoms. Event-related  analysis  conﬁ rmed  that  the  amygdala  and  the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex were signiﬁ cantly active  in both patients with anxiety disorders and healthy controls  across  all  participants  (all  trials vs   baseline  within  ROIs:  rostral x,y,z=–2,2,–50;  t=4·01, p[FWE–voxel]=0·013; dorsal  t=3·88;  p[uncorrected]=0·0002;  amygdala  x,y,z=2,8,56,   298   www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 1  September 2014  Articles  See Online for appendix  2·5  2·0  1·5  1·0  0·5  0  –0·5  –1·0  –1·5  –2·0  –2·5     20  30  50  40 Trait anxiety score  60  70  80  A  B    ) s a t e b (   y t i v i t c e n n o c e c a f   y p p a h   s v e c a f   l        u f r a e F     Figure 3: Continuous variable analysis (A) Group map of the regions in the brain that correlate with trait anxiety for  the fear vs happy contrast.

This eﬀ ect overlaps the peaks emphasised  in our previous study,7 thus, we show the existence of a  circuit  that  contributes  to  both  adaptive  anxiety  responses  and,  when  to  maladaptive  responses—a  prerequisite  for  a  more  mechanistic,  neurobiologically  rooted  diagnosis  and  treatment of pathological anxiety (panel).  chronically  activated,   to  represent   We  have  previously  called  this  circuit  an  aversive  ampliﬁ cation  circuit  in  accordance  with  ﬁ ndings  from  studies  in  rodents.  These  have  shown  the  prelimbic  prefrontal  cortex  to  drive  amygdala  activity  and  lead  to  increased responses to fear.10 In people, dorsal regions of  the prefrontal cortext and anterior cingulate cortex have  been  argued  functional  homologues  of  this  region.30,31  Previous  work  across  several  anxiety  disorders  has,  for  example,  conﬁ rmed  hyperactivity  in  the  dorsal  medial  prefrontal  cortex  or  dorsal anterior cingulate cortex or the amygdala in simple  event-related studies.5,18,19,32,33 Indeed, the studies by Milad  and  colleagues30  and  Mechias  and  colleagues19  show  a  similar pattern to both our current and previous ﬁ ndings7  of  a  larger  more  posterior  cluster  and  a  smaller  more  rostral prefrontal cluster. In these studies, the function of   the  human   x,y,z=28,–2,12,  t=5·09,  p[FWE–voxel]<0·0001).  However,  when we broke this analysis down into groups (ie, healthy  participants and those with anxiety disorders), no signiﬁ cant  interaction  with  groups  was  noted  (rostral:  diagnosis-byvalence  x,y,z=–2,4,30,  t=1·7,  p[uncorrected]=0·045;  dorsal:  x,y,z=–2,2,28,  t=1·9,  p[uncorrected]=0·029;  amygdala  valence-by-diagnosis p>0·4). Exploratory whole-brain eventrelated activation interactions are presented in the appendix.  SPSS general linear models of estimates extracted from  the a priori peak voxel showed no signiﬁ cant diﬀ erences  on  variables  of  interest  across  DSM  subdiagnoses  (valence [ fear, happy] by diagnosis [ie, generalised anxiety  disorder,  social  anxiety  disorder,  both  generalised  and  social anxiety disorder, or healthy] interaction: F[3,41]=2·2,  p=0·1, partial eta² 0·1 [95% CI 0·00–0·29]; main eﬀ ect of  diagnosis p<0·2).   Restriction of the primary analyses to a primary diagnosis  of  generalised  anxiety  disorder  (ie,  including  all  patients  with generalised anxiety disorder and those with comorbid  generalised  anxiety  disorder  and  social  anxiety  disorder  [n=15]  but  excluding  those  with  social  anxiety  disorder  only)  replicated  the  whole-group  eﬀ ects  (dorsal  peak  vs  trait  anxiety:  x,y,z=4,–8,38,  t=3·88,  p[uncorrected]<0·001;  1-tailed  test  of  x,y,z=2,2,40  vs  trait  anxiety:  r[38]=0·3,  p=0·04]). Thus, traditional subdiagnoses are not suﬃ  cient  to explain the neurobiological abnormality in patients with  anxiety disorders.  Task  accuracy  (correct  identiﬁ cation  of  face  emotion) was 81% across the whole study population, with a mean  reaction  time  of  705  ms  (SD  72)  for  happy  faces  and  708  ms  (SD  71)  for  fearful  faces  across  both  groups.  Valence had no signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect on reaction time across  the sample overall (fear vs happy reaction time t[44]=0·4,  p=0·7)  or  on  a  group-by-valence  interaction  in  reaction  time (p=0·14). However, in support of a brain–behaviour  association,  whole-brain  analysis  of  all  participants  showed  a  peak  in  the  dorsal  anterior  cingulate  cortex  driven by a signiﬁ cant negative association between fear  and  happy  connectivity  and  fear  versus  happy  reaction  time (x,y,z=0,12,22; t=4; p[uncorrected]=0·0001). In other  words,  greater  connectivity  during  the  processing  of  fearful  faces  than  happy  faces  was  associated  with  a  faster response to fearful faces than to happy faces.  Discussion This study conﬁ rmed our hypothesis that engagement  of the aversive ampliﬁ cation circuit—recruited during  stress in healthy individuals in our previous studies7,9— would  be  increased  in  the  absence  of  shock  threat  in  the  context  of  pathological  anxiety.  Speciﬁ cally,  we  show  increased  positive  coupling  within  the  dorsal  medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex–amygdala  circuit during fearful face processing in patients with  generalised and social anxiety disorders. Moreover, we  show that this increased coupling follows a continuum  of  trait  anxiety,  with  the  patients  showing  greatest  the  most  severe  coupling  also  presenting  with   www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 1  September 2014   299  Articles  these  regions  is  argued  to  be  in  fear  conditioning  and  conscious  appraisal  of  threats,  respectively—both  of  which align well with our proposed circuit function. The  present study employs connectivity analysis to study the  coupling between this dorsal region and the amygdala in  a  circuit  in  pathological  anxiety.  This  approach  is  important  because  coupling  is  thought  to  represent  a  distinct  informational  process  relative  to  activation,   Panel: Research in context  Systematic review This study was part of a programmatic sequence of studies  and takes its main inspiration from these previous works.  However, inspiration was also drawn from translational  animal work10,30,31 and both original trials and review papers  exploring activity within the studied brain regions in both  patients and healthy populations.2–5,17–19,32,33 Further inspiration  was drawn from data (again from both original studies and  reviews) exploring connectivity within this circuit13 and a  related ventral circuit11–15 in both patients and healthy  controls. Relevant articles were identiﬁ ed through searches of  PubMed and Google Scholar including combinations of the  terms “anxiety”, “stress”, “anxiety disorders”, “GAD”, “social  anxiety”, “PPI”, “fMRI”, “connectivity”, “amygdala“,“coupling“,  “dACC“,“dmPFC“ in August, 2013. Our search was of the  entire PubMed catalogue (from start until present) and we  included articles published in English only. To the best of our  knowledge, this study is the ﬁ rst to explore connectivity  within this circuit across social or generalised anxiety disorder  and healthy controls.  Interpretation The present data, together with our previous work, suggest  that a common mechanism, namely positive dorsal medial  prefrontal cortex–amygdala coupling during aversive  processing, might underlie both healthy stress responses and  social and generalised anxiety disorders. Moreover, this  mechanism might track subjective anxiety symptoms such  that increased recruitment of this circuit is associated with  greater self-reported trait anxiety. Although this report is  early experimental work, the ﬁ ndings have two potential  clinical implications. First, this study is a step away from  categorical diagnoses based on symptoms and towards a  more continuum-based, mechanistic understanding of  anxiety pathology. Speciﬁ cally, the data provide experimental  support for the idea that anxiety subtypes might share  overlapping neurobiological abnormalities that fall along a  continuous scale from adaptive to pathological. Second, from  a clinical perspective, these data might ultimately help to  target treatments. We have shown this circuit to be  modulated by serotonin and as such we provide a potential  mechanism by which such drugs enact their anxiolytic  properties. This could, in turn, provide a potential means of  identifying individuals who will respond to such treatments  (eg, patients who would be better suited to psychological or  pharmacological interventions).  which speciﬁ cally represents the ﬂ ow of information and  attentional processes.20 It is not that these regions are any  more  or  less  eﬃ  cient  at  processing  information  in  the  pathological  disorder;  rather,  the  extent  to  which  they  communicate is changed.   Our ﬁ ndings therefore allow us to map a potential neural  pathway for a key symptom that unites anxiety disorders,  namely  chronically  increased  threat  processing.  The  amygdala  might  detect  threats,  but  the  dorsal  medial  prefrontal  (anterior  cingulate)  cortex  could  be  a  central  node  of  a  broader  anxiety  circuit,  playing  a  key  part  in  integration  of  threat  information  and  orchestration  of  response  expression  through  synchronised  activity  with  distant  brain  regions.  Thus,  this  circuit  is  activated  in  stressful environments (eg, shock anticipation7) to promote  the  adaptive34  detection  of  threatening  stimuli  (at  the  expense of non-threatening stimuli [Vytal K, unpublished]).  In  healthy  people  under  innocuous  circumstances,  mild  threats  (eg,  fearful  faces)  do  not  increase  dorsal  medial  prefrontal  cortex–amygdala  coupling,  but  in  pathological  anxiety  this  circuit  becomes  permanently  switched  on,  even in innocuous contexts, and contributes to a crippling  focus upon negative life experiences. Of course, this is not  the  only  symptom  characteristic  of  pathological  anxiety,  but it is a core feature that perhaps uniﬁ es both adaptive  and pathological anxiety.  in  which  diagnosis   Our  ability  to  map  a  potential  symptom  pathway  from  adaptive  to  maladaptive  states  supports  the  clinical  potential  of  this  circuit.  First,  from  a  diagnostic  perspective,  we  show  that  neural  circuit  engagement  exists  along a continuum as a function of self-reported symptoms,  and irrespective of the traditional DSM-deﬁ ned diagnosis  of generalised or social anxiety disorder. Psychiatry is the  only  branch  of  medicine  is  predominantly based upon self-reported symptoms rather  than underlying mechanisms; the present ﬁ ndings provide  the  potential  beginnings  of  a  dimensional,  mechanistic  anxiety  index  with  diagnostic  value.21,35  Anxiety  disorder  subtypes are highly comorbid36,37 and our present data are  consistent with the assumption that this is because, at least  as far as generalised and social anxiety disorders go, the  neural  circuit  underlying  a  core  symptom  of  anxiety  disorders—a bias towards threats—falls along a diagnosisindependent  continuum.  Such  a  scale  could  comprise  a  row  of  the  “negative  valence  symptoms”  category  of  the  Research Domains Criteria matrix35,38 which seeks to create  biologically informed psychiatric diagnoses. Future work  with a much larger sample of individuals, a broader range  of anxious traits, and undertaken across several sites will  be the next step towards translation of this ﬁ nding into a  clinically useful measure.  Second, our previous work with this circuit provides a  mechanism  by  which  we  might  be  able  to  target  treatments.  The  direction  of  correlation  between  symptom severity and circuit engagement suggests that  we should attempt to disrupt activity within this circuit.  We  have,  in  fact,  shown  this  circuit  to  be  inhibited  by   300   www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 1  September 2014  Articles  Declaration of interests We declare no competing interests.

Thus,  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  could  restore  inhibition  of  this  circuit,39 reducing responses to aversive stimuli. Such an  understanding  is  key  because,  despite  the  widespread  use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs, our  understanding of their mechanism of action is far from  adequate,39  leading  to  ineﬃ  cient  prescription.  Perhaps  this circuit will provide a means of recognising patients  who will respond positively to treatment. In a specialty  in which a large proportion of patients do not respond to  their  ﬁ rst  treatment,  even  a  small  increase  in  success  rate would be beneﬁ cial.  Future  work  can  therefore  ask:  what  interventions— pharmacological or psychological—can serve to attenuate  activity  within  this  circuit  during  aversive  processing?  Evidence  suggests,  for  example,  that  cognitive-based  treatments can target nodes within this circuit.40 One of  the biggest impediments to treatment development is the  failure of animal screens to scale up to human beings and  a lack of naturalistic human screening markers.1,41 Since  we have shown that this circuit can be safely and reversibly  activated  in  healthy  individuals,8  while  simultaneously  linking it to clinical presentation, we might be able to use  provocation of this circuit as a screen for more targeted  assessment of candidate anxiolytics.1,42  To show the validity of our ﬁ ndings from several angles,  we obtained traditional subtype diagnoses. This analysis  replicated key eﬀ ects independent of subdiagnosis, but it  should  be  noted  that  our  naturalistic  sample  contained  fewer people with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder  alone.  Additional  analyses  suggested  that  this  did  not  unduly  aﬀ ect  the  overall  ﬁ ndings,  but  extra  caution  should  be  exercised  in  drawing  conclusions  about  this  particular subgroup because of the sample size.   Moreover, and importantly, we are not arguing that this  is  the  sole  role  of  this  circuit  and,  furthermore,  we  are  somewhat  agnostic  regarding  naming  the  prefrontal  region  (eg,  dorsal  medial  prefrontal  cortex  vs  dorsal  anterior cingulate cortex). What is crucial is that we have  noted  an  overlapping  pattern  across  several  studies  examining anxiety-related processes using matched tasks. In conclusion, this study shows engagement of the dorsal  medial  prefrontal  (anterior  cingulate)  cortex–amygdala  circuit during aversive processing in pathological anxiety. A  detailed  understanding  of  the  relation  between  neural  circuitry and such core anxiety symptoms is, we argue, a  prerequisite  for  more  targeted  diagnosis  and  treatments.  We hope that this study represents a ﬁ rst step towards a  more mechanistic and dimensional understanding of the  pathology underlying anxiety disorders.

Aims: To characterize the role of prefrontal and mesolimbic/hippocampal dysfunction during memory encoding in schizophrenia. Method: Neuronal activation in schizophrenia patients and controls was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during encoding of words in a deep (semantic judgement) and shallow (case judgment) task. A free recall (no delay) and a recognition task (24 h delay) were performed. Results: Free recall, but not recognition performance was reduced in patients. Reduced performance was correlated with positive symptoms which in turn were related to increased left hippocampal activity during successful encoding. Furthermore, schizophrenia patients displayed a hippocampal hyperactivity during deep encoding irrespective of encoding success along with a reduced anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) activity in successful encoding but an intact left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC) activity. Conclusions: This study provides the ﬁrst evidence directly linking positive symptoms and memory deﬁcits to dysfunctional hippocampal hyperactivity. It thereby underscores the pivotal pathophysiological role of a hyperdopaminergic mesolimbic state in schizophrenia.  © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.  1. Introduction  Since the original description of schizophrenia by Bleuler (1911) the psychopathological concept of this disease has been developed substantially. Most notably, cognitive deﬁcits such as attention deﬁcits and memory impairment have been recognized as core features that persist and importantly contribute to disease-related disability. Declarative memory impairment is one of the most disabling cognitive deﬁcits in schizophrenia (Heckers et al., 1998).  Schizophrenia patients exhibit functional and structural abnormalities in brain structures that subserve declarative memory, most notably the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus (Bogerts et al., 1991). In declarative memory, two experimentally discriminable forms have been described: familiarity-based recognition and recollection of context rich memory (Yonelinas, 1999a, 1998). They are mediated by partly dissociable neural structures, with the  ⁎ Corresponding author. Department of Psychiatry, Leipziger Strasse 44, 39120  Magdeburg, Germany.

At this, verbal stimuli are encoded incidentally, using either a perceptual task (shallow level, e.g. counting syllables, case judgment) or a more elaborate semantic task (deep level, e.g. pleasantness/animacy rating). Depth of encoding has been shown to correlate with memory performance (Craik and Lockhart, 1972).  Up to now, studies of neuronal activation in schizophrenia-related impairment of declarative memory have yielded heterogeneous results with respect to prefrontal as well as hippocampal hyper- or hypoactivation (Kubicki et al., 2003; Ragland et al., 2004). Recent hypotheses regarding the major role of disturbed dopaminergic mesolimbic function in schizophrenia have postulated that psychotic symptoms arise from a hyperdopaminergic state. It has also been established that memory encoding critically depends on novelty detection which is again mediated by the mesolimbic dopaminergic circuitry.  In this context the present study aims to explore whether hippocampal dysfunction contributes to schizophrenia-related  188  K. Zierhut et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 183 (2010) 187–194  encoding deﬁcits and whether this effect is related to psychotic symptoms that reﬂect hyperdopaminergic mesolimbic activity. Furthermore, it addresses the role of prefrontal cortex dysfunction.  2. Methods  2.1. Subjects  A clinically well characterized group of patients with paranoidhallucinatory schizophrenia (n=11, 4 female, mean age 29 years, medicated with atypical neuroleptic drugs, no benzodiazepines, see also Table 1) (International classiﬁcation of diseases Release 10 (ICD10) F20, no neuropsychiatric comorbidities) and healthy volunteers (n=13, 6 female, mean age 25 years) participated in the experiment on two consecutive days. All participants had normal or corrected-tonormal vision, were right-handed and native speakers of German. All participants were checked for MRI contraindications and gave written informed consent to participate. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the medical faculty, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg. Control subjects underwent routine clinical interview for history of neurological and psychiatric illnesses. Subjects with present or past neurological or psychiatric disorders or the use of any drugs were excluded.  Control subjects were matched with the patients in age, education and handedness. Controls and patients did not signiﬁcantly differ with respect to age, education (years in school) and gender (see Table 1). Diagnosis of paranoid-hallucinatory schizophrenia was established by psychiatric evaluation. According to the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) (Kay et al., 1987) and the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) (Overall and Gorham, 1962) all patients were mildly to moderately impaired (see Table 1).  2.2. Behavioural tasks  2.2.1. LOP paradigm with free recall  On the ﬁrst day, participants performed an incidental encoding paradigm with an LOP manipulation, that has previously been applied identically in several studies, and is speciﬁcally designed to assess neuronal activation during encoding (Schott et al., 2004, 2006). In order to investigate the correlates of successful memory formation neural responses to novel words in two different study tasks (deep and shallow study of items) were compared as a function of subsequent remembering or forgetting in a free recall task directly after the encoding and in a recognition task 24 h later (Schott et al., 2004).  The fMRI experiment (= LOP-encoding with free recall task) consisted of three runs lasting 20 min, respectively. Each run comprised three sessions with a deep study task (pleasantness judgment: indication of a pleasant or unpleasant word) and three sessions with a shallow study task (phonemic syllable counting:  Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects.

Subjects responded via button press using their right and left index ﬁngers. Response hands were counterbalanced across participants. Each session consisted of the presentation of a central ﬁxation cross for 250 ms, a word for 1500 ms, and a further ﬁxation cross for 1000 ms. Twenty words were presented during each session. Those were followed by a distractor task consisting of four moderately difﬁcult arithmetic operations in order to prevent internal rehearsal of studied words. Speciﬁcally, subjects indicated via button press whether the presented result of two- to three-digit additions was correct or not. After the distractor task, subjects were prompted to freely recall all studied words they could remember and respond overtly. The duration of the free recall phase was 90 s. Overt responses were recorded using a microphone at the bottom of the head coil and scored off-line.  For both tasks (LOP-encoding with free recall and recognition task) 540 words were selected randomly from a pool of 600 substantives, adjectives and verbs (neutral meaning, frequency of occurrence = 46) (Baayen et al., 1993).  2.2.2. Recognition task  The recognition experiment was conducted 24 h after the LOPencoding with free recall task. It consisted of 540 words including 360 of the LOP-encoding task (180 deeply and 180 shallowly encoded words that previously had to be recalled in the fMRI experiment) and 180 new words and was conducted outside the scanner. The task was divided into 9 sessions of 60 words each and a short break of 60 s after each session. Words were presented in a randomized way beginning with a central ﬁxation cross for 1000 ms, a word for 4000 ms and a further ﬁxation cross for 1000 ms. The participants had to decide via button press using either their right index ﬁnger if the present word was old/known or their right middle ﬁnger if it was new (or vice versa). Again, response ﬁngers were counterbalanced across participants.  Behavioural data (including the number of correct/incorrect answers and reaction times) of the free recall and the recognition paradigms were analysed using the SPSS statistical software package. We included only subjects with a performance above chance level as indicated by the discriminability index (d′) N0.5 (Swets, 1964; Green, 1966). Within-group effects and between-group differences (patients vs. healthy participants) were tested using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test.  2.3. fMRI image acquisition and analysis  FMRI data were acquired during tacit encoding of words as described above. The experiment was conducted in a GE 1.5 T Signa MRI system (General Electric Medical Systems) using a standard quadrature head coil. Echo-planar images (EPIs) were acquired at a TR of 2.0 s and a TE of 35 ms. Images consisted of 23 interleaved axial slices parallel to the AC–PC plane (matrix 64×64; ﬁeld of view 22 cm; slice thickness 5 mm; 1 mm gap; 544 volumes per session). SPM2 (Wellcome Dept. of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, London, UK) was used for pre-processing and data analysis. EPIs were corrected for acquisition delay, realigned, normalized to the MNI stereotactic reference frame (Montreal Neurological Institute; voxel size: 3×3×3 mm), smoothed (Gaussian kernel, 8 mm), and highpass-ﬁltered (128 s). Statistical analysis was carried out using a two-stage mixed effects model. In the ﬁrst stage, neural activity was modelled by a δ function at stimulus onset for each individual subject. The ensuing bloodoxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response was modelled by convolving these δ functions with a canonical hemodynamic response function (hrf). The resulting time courses were down-sampled for each scan to form covariates in a General Linear Model (GLM). The covariates of the GLM for individual subjects' contrasts were the conditions of interest, one covariate time-locked to each speech event (overt response in free recall), six for the rigid-body movement parameters derived from realignment, a 20 s epoch for the distractor task, and a constant  K.

In order to speciﬁcally investigate mechanisms related to level of processing and successful encoding as assessed in the free recall task, respectively, difference and thus no baseline contrasts (t statistics for deep vs. shallow processing and remembered vs. forgotten, respectively) were used for all second level comparisons. To assess overall effects of LOP and subsequent memory performance, contrast images [LOP contrast: (deep hits+deep misses) vs. (shallow hits+shallow misses); subsequent memory contrast: (deep hits+shallow hits) vs. (deep misses+shallow misses)] were entered into one-sample t-tests.  In addition to a voxel-based analysis we used spherical regions of interest (ROI) analysis for temporal structures (hippocampus, and superior temporal gyrus) and for prefrontal regions (left inferior prefrontal cortex, LIFC; dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, DMPFC; and anterior cingulated cortex, ACC) of both hemispheres. The centers of the spherical ROIs were placed in the SPM-identiﬁed maxima for each relevant contrast within both groups. Given the considerable size differences of the brain structures of interest, the radius of the spherical ROIs was set to 15 mm for the frontal regions (LIFC; dorso lateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC; DMPFC), 7 mm for the hippocampus, and 10 mm for the superior temporal gyrus. The signiﬁcance level for the overall group analyses was set to 0.05 (uncorrected), with an extent threshold of 5 adjacent voxels.  In order to display the time course of the hrf BOLD signal time courses of the hippocampus (spherical ROI 7 mm) were produced by averaging the time course of each subject across multiple voxels during deep encoding.  2.4. Psychopathological assessment  Patients were also tested for disease severity at the time of participation using the PANSS (subscales: positive symptomatic, negative symptomatic and general psychopathology) and the BPRS.  2.4.1. Psychopathology, memory impairments and hippocampal activity A correlation analysis was conducted in order to test for a relation of actual psychotic symptoms with behavioural and neuronal measures of memory impairment. Two-tailed spearman rho correlation coefﬁcients were calculated in the patients between schizophrenia symptoms (PANSS: subscales positive and negative symptomatic) and memory performance as well as neuronal activation (fMRI BOLD signal) in the hippocampus during encoding. Again, the signiﬁcance level was set to 0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Behavioural results  3.1.1. Free recall task  Overall, schizophrenia patients freely recalled signiﬁcantly less of the studied words than controls (16% vs. 32%, F(1,22) =32.34; P b0.001). Both groups remembered a larger proportion of deeply encoded words as compared to shallowly encoded words (LOP effect in controls: meandeep = 68.77 words (38%) meanshallow = 46.38 words (26%); F(1,12) = 82.86; P b0.001; schizophrenia subjects: meandeep=32.91 words (18%); meanshallow=23.45 words (13%) F (1,10)=12.59; P=0.005). Schizophrenia patients beneﬁtted less from deep in comparison to shallow encoding than controls (Group×LOP, F(1,22)=13.67; P=0.001) (see Fig. 1).  3.1.2. Delayed recognition task  In the delayed recognition task (24 h after the encoding and free recall task) the number of correctly recognized words (collapsed over deep and shallow words) did not differ between the patients (mean=128.69 words; 72%) and controls (mean=142.91 words, 79%) (F(1,17)=2.66; P=0.121) for those subjects with a performance  Fig. 1.

Accordingly, 11 controls and 9 patients were included in this subanalysis. Controls again showed a robust LOP effect (meandeep=153.18 words (86%) meanshallow=132.63 words (73%); F(1,10)=20.13; P=0.001), while for the patients this effect could only be seen as a statistical trend (meandeep=133.88 words (75%); meanshallow=123.50 words (69%); F(1,8)=4.79; P=0.053) (see Fig. 2).  3.2. Imaging data  3.2.1. Controls: LIFC activation during deep encoding  During memory encoding in control subjects, deep as compared to shallow processing (contrast: deep vs. shallow, collapsed over hits and misses) was associated with an increase of cerebral blood ﬂow in the LIFC and DMPFC (voxel-wise t statistics; P b0.001, respectively). In the contrast between subsequently remembered and forgotten words (contrast: hits vs. misses, collapsed over deep and shallow), healthy controls showed a stronger activation in the left hippocampus (ROI-analysis 7 mm sphere; P =0.02) during the encoding of later remembered words. Previously deeply encoded and later remembered words (contrast: deeply encoded words only — hits vs. misses) were associated with activation of the left ACC (ROI-analysis, 10 mm sphere; P=0.008), and LIFC (ROI-analysis, 15 mm sphere; P=0.011) (see Table 2 and Fig. 3).  3.2.2. Schizophrenia patients: preserved LIFC activity  Similar to healthy controls, schizophrenia patients showed increased activation of the LIFC (ROI-analysis 15 mm sphere;  Fig. 2.

Compared to the encoding of words that were later forgotten (see Table 3), the neural activation of left superior temporal gyrus (ROIanalysis, 10 mm sphere; P =0.047) was more pronounced during the encoding of later remembered words (contrast: hits vs. misses) (see Table 3, Fig. 4).  3.2.3. Group comparison: hypoactivity in ACC and DMPFC, but unspeciﬁc left hippocampal hyperactivity in schizophrenia  In a subsequent volume analysis between groups, healthy controls had in comparison to patients a signiﬁcantly higher activation in the left ACC and the right DMPFC (volume analysis; P =0.025, respectively) for the contrast hits vs. misses. A ROI-analysis between groups showed a stronger activation of the left hippocampus (ROI-analysis 7 mm sphere; P= 0.031) in the patient group during deep encoding which did not differ between words that were later remembered and those that were later not remembered (contrast: deep vs. shallow, collapsed over hits and misses) (see Table 4 and Fig. 5). Hippocampal hyperactivity is also shown in Fig. 6 which displays the hrf time courses of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls during deep encoding (stimulus onset= 0 s).  3.3. Psychopathology, memory performance and neuronal hippocampal activity  In schizophrenia patients, the severity of prevalent positive symptoms was negatively correlated with the number of freely recalled words (r =−0.627; α=0.05; 2-tailed). Additionally, more pronounced positive symptoms were associated with a stronger BOLD response in the left hippocampus during successful semantic encoding in the patients (r =0.626; α=0.05; 2-tailed). No correlation was found between negative symptoms and memory performance or BOLD responses.  4. Discussion  In the present study we observed a remarkable relation of memory impairment, neuronal activity, and psychopathology in schizophrenia patients. Memory impairments in the patients came along with a peculiar hippocampal activation pattern: left hippocampal activity was unspeciﬁcally increased during deep encoding. Furthermore, memory impairment was related to more pronounced positive symptoms which in turn were associated with stronger left hippocampal activation in the more infrequently occurring events of successful semantic encoding.  Overall, the patients displayed an impaired performance and a reduced LOP effect in the free recall task, which were accompanied by relatively unaltered neuronal LIFC activations, but decreased ACC and DMPFC activity during encoding.  4.1. Differential impairment of recall and recognition  We observed a dissociation of free recall and recognition memory impairment in schizophrenia patients. Behavioral data of both tasks indicate that declarative memory deﬁcits in schizophrenia patients mainly affect recall, while recognition remains relatively intact. In the framework of the dual-process model of declarative memory this deﬁcit pattern could be accounted for by a relatively selective impairment of recollection, but relative sparing of familiarity-based memory retrieval (Yonelinas, 1999a,b). It has previously been shown that patients with a frontal lobe damage have difﬁculties in the active recollection of memory traces but not in familiarity-based recognition (Yonelinas, 1999a,b). Cytoarchitectonic abnormalities and frontotemporal volume reductions are a well-replicated ﬁnding in schizophrenia patients (Bogerts et al., 1991). Given that storage and recall of declarative memory rely critically on the interaction of frontal and limbic brain regions (Düzel et al., 2001) structural alterations in these regions in schizophrenia might lead to memory deﬁcits that share features with those observed after frontal lobe damage. Nevertheless, previous ﬁndings as well as our study cannot clearly elucidate whether the memory deﬁcit is attributable to disturbed encoding or retrieval processes.  Alternatively, the selective recall deﬁcit in the patients might be related to disturbed hippocampal integrity. Investigations in patients with selective hippocampal damage and fMRI studies in healthy humans suggest that the hippocampus might be particularly critical for recollection-based memory processes, such as recall, but not familiarity-based recognition (Düzel et al., 2001). Both, schizophrenia patients and controls generally beneﬁted from deep encoding in the free recall task even though this LOP effect was less pronounced in the patient group. This reduction of both overall memory performance and LOP effect in the patients might be related to separable pathomechanisms. While the overall recall deﬁcit, evident in the deep and shallow condition, might be best explained by structural hippocampal deﬁcits in schizophrenia, the reduced LOP effect might be related to impaired interaction between frontal and limbic components of the declarative memory networks.  In contrast to the impaired free recall in the patients, the number of recognized words did not differ between both groups, indicating an intact recognition performance in the patients. Thus, our data show that recollection and familiarity are differentially affected in schizophrenia. The assumption of two separate and hence independently vulnerable processes underlying recognition and recollection is in line with multiple previous ﬁndings in healthy controls (Yonelinas, 1999a,b). In contrast to our data, other studies described an intact LOP effect for schizophrenia subjects in recognition tasks which tested item recognition directly after encoding (Heckers et al., 1998; Ragland et al., 2003). Our data show this effect only in a statistical trend and it may thus be detectable when examining larger samples.  K.

Enhanced neural activity of left (L) inferior prefrontal cortex (white arrow) during semantic encoding. B. Increased left (L) hippocampal blood ﬂow (white arrow) during successful encoding.  4.2. Normal LIFC activity, but unspeciﬁcally increased hippocampal activity and DMPFC hypoactivity  Interestingly, during semantic encoding schizophrenia subjects showed a neural activation of LIFC comparable to healthy controls (see Figs. 3 and 4). Hippocampus and LIFC represent a semantic network. Whereas the hippocampus plays a crucial role in general successful encoding, independently of encoding depth (Schacter et al., 1996), the LIFC shows neural activation during semantic encoding (Kapur et al., 1994). An activation increase in the LIFC appears to be associated with a successful semantic encoding (Ragland et al., 2001). The apparently normal activation of LIFC in the patients suggests that patients are successfully engaged in deep vs. shallow processing in our study, which is reﬂected by the presence of a behavioural LOP effect. Notably, hippocampal activation in schizophrenia patients was not speciﬁc to successful encoding, but occurred as an overall effect of LOP, irrespective of encoding success. This result is in line with a previously observed increased mediotemporal fMRI activation in schizophrenia subjects that was not related to task performance (Kubicki et al., 2003; Ragland et al., 2006). An important function of the hippocampus increasingly gaining attention is to detect novelty by comparing incoming with stored information. This novelty detection again triggers the ﬁring of neurons in the ventral tegmental areal (VTA) which is connected to the hippocampus by dopaminergic projections. These projections appear to trigger dopamine release in the hippocampus, which in turn is crucial for consolidation processes of long-term memory (Lisman et al., 2008). Accordingly, in schizophrenia patients an increased hippocampal activity might disturb this delicate circuit resulting in insufﬁcient novelty detection and thus a deﬁcient encoding (Bunzeck et al., 2007). In case of such a continuous dopaminergic activity the comparator function of the hippocampus,  distinguishing new from stored information, might be impaired. Thus, information could be encoded only randomly and infrequently, leading to the reduced memory performance of schizophrenia subjects in the free recall task.  During semantic encoding, schizophrenia subjects showed an activation of left DMPFC similar to healthy controls in addition to normal neural activity of LIFC. However, this activation of DMPFC was  Table 3 Volume and region of interest (ROI) analysis within patient group: local maxima of blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI signal change in schizophrenic subjects; extent threshold: k=5 voxel; threshold: 0.01; Puncorrected b0.05.

The DMPFC is sensitive to emotional stimuli and seems to be involved in higher-order emotional processing (Davidson, 1995). The use of a pleasantness judgment during the semantic encoding task might explain the activation of neural networks implicated in emotion processing, such as the DMPFC. Thus, besides a partly impaired semantic encoding, schizophrenia patients could not beneﬁt from the emotional decision making of a presented stimulus for a later exact remembrance.  Finally, compared to healthy controls, schizophrenia patients showed decreased activation of ACC during successful encoding. As the ACC is crucial for focussing the attention on task-related processes (Crottaz-Herbette and Menon, 2006) such a deﬁcitary ACC activity could result in an insufﬁcient top-down attentional modulation to task-irrelevant processes, and thereby impairing encoding performance.  4.3. Positive symptoms are associated with impaired recall performance and abnormal hippocampal activity  Schizophrenia patients scoring higher in the positive symptom scale of the PANSS had a reduced memory performance during free recall but also showed, beyond that, a stronger BOLD response in the left hippocampus when items were successfully encoded. Taken  Table 4 Volume and region of interest (ROI) analysis between groups: local maxima of bloodoxygen-level-dependent fMRI signal change; extent threshold: k=5 voxel; threshold: 0.01; Puncorrected b0.05.  together, these results indicate that positive symptoms are associated with impaired recollective performance in conjunction with an increased hippocampal neuronal activation, necessary to successfully encode semantic information. This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis that in the presence of positive symptoms additional neuronal activity may be needed in order to compensate for dysfunctional mediotemporal processes of memory encoding. Our ﬁnding of an unspeciﬁcally increased hippocampal activity during semantic encoding thus either may reﬂect the pathophysiological underpinning of defective medio temporal processes itself or also may reﬂect a compensatory response to dysfunctional mechanisms. Such a dysfunction may possibly be related to a previously hypothesized disorganized mesolimbic circuit involving a hyperdopaminergic state in schizophrenia that interferes with the encoding of memory information (Lisman and Grace, 2005; Lisman et al., 2008). Thus, the extraordinarily strong neuronal activation which is necessary to exceed the increased threshold for successful encoding, and which is reﬂected by increased neuronal activation in the patients to successful deep encoding, may explain the considerably decreased encoding success in patients with pronounced positive symptoms.  On the contrary, in the present study negative symptoms were not associated with behavioural or functional impairments in the patients. Even though there have been reports of detrimental effects of negative symptoms that mainly involved affective symptoms such as blunted affect and anhedonia on memory, the results are inconsistent. Some studies that found detrimental effects on memory have addressed emotional memory (Sachs et al., 2004) while others did not ﬁnd such memory effects for neutral stimuli (Mathews and Barch, 2004) suggesting that possibly the affective component of these tasks may play a role.

Future studies should address whether the temporolimbic hyperactivity is detectable in more acutely ill patients too, and whether it varies as a function of disease activity and may possibly be useful as a biological marker of disease activity.  5.1. Limitations  As ‘schizophrenia’ comprises a spectrum of psychiatric conditions, symptoms as well as neuroanatomical abnormalities differ considerably between individuals. This heterogeneity is very likely reﬂected in  K. Zierhut et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 183 (2010) 187–194  193  Fig. 5. Group analysis: C.

Thus we focussed on a highly homogeneous patient group of mildly symptomatic patients what led to the moderate sample size.  Another problem, well known in patient studies, is neuroleptic medication that is known to reduce positive symptoms but has not consistently been associated with memory improvement in schizophrenia (Goldberg et al., 2007). Thus it remains to be explored in future studies whether the improvement of positive symptoms under neuroleptic medication is also associated with normalized hippocampus function and possibly memory improvement in the longer term or whether positive symptom and memory improvement dissociate, hence contradicting a common pathophysiology.  In the light of a recently published paper by Kriegeskorte et al. (2009) our results clearly have to be considered in a differentiated way. At this, the authors demonstrated impressively that problems of circularity arise in neuroimaging analyses when group comparisons are calculated at locations identiﬁed in a data driven manner. In the present study, ﬁrstly, group comparisons were calculated in strictly a priori deﬁned anatomical regions on the one hand, but, on the other hand, within these regions SPM derived local maxima were used. Thus, these data rather replicate previous ﬁndings and should be considered as supportive evidence. Secondly, we conducted correlation analyses at the identiﬁed locations that do not underlie this reservation due to circular analysis problems and thus have to be considered as conclusive ﬁndings.

While their physical properties can be read of their perceptual appearance, the meaning of symbolic artifacts depends on the perceiver's interpretative attitude and embeddedness in cultural practices. In this study, participants built models of LEGO bricks to illustrate their understanding of abstract concepts. They were then scanned with fMRI while presented to photographs of their own and others' models. When participants attended to the meaning of the models in contrast to their bare physical properties, we observed activations in mPFC and TPJ, areas often associated with social cognition, and IFG, possibly related to semantics. When contrasting own and others' models, we also found activations in precuneus, an area associated with autobiographical memory and agency, while looking at one's own collective models yielded interaction effects in rostral ACC, right IFG and left Insula. Interestingly, variability in the insula was predicted by individual differences in participants' feeling of relatedness to their fellow group members during LEGO construction activity. Our ﬁndings support a view of symbolic artifacts as neurocognitive trails of human social interactions.  © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  Introduction  One of the great hallmarks of the human species is our profound engagement with material objects and technologies. Unlike even our closest primate relatives, we actively shape, explore and exploit our material surroundings to construct cultural and cognitive niches (Clark, 2006; Laland et al., 2000). While many material inventions consist in sophisticated tools for instrumental and pragmatic engagement of the environment, the broad class of symbolic artifacts does its work by virtue of meaning. Objects such as national ﬂags, religious symbols, artworks, road signs, pictorial representations etc. are imbued with social signiﬁcance as they are developed, negotiated and engaged in a variety of cultural practices. More than mere physical objects, we thus experience them as vehicles of social meaning: although a red trafﬁc light does not present any physical impediment to movement, it still (most often) stops us from crossing the street. These pairings between physical forms and socially negotiated meanings are ubiquitous in human society and play a crucial role in structuring individual behaviors and social interactions (Latour, 1996, 2000; Roepstorff, 2008). Furthermore, novel form-meaning pairings are readily and ﬂexibly established online in contexts of communication and coordination (Galantucci, 2005; Garrod et al., 2007), or pretense play (Leslie, 1987; Whitehead et al.,  ⁎ Corresponding author at: School of Communication and Culture, Jens Chr. Skous Vej 2,  8000 Aarhus, Denmark.  E-mail address: kristian@cc.au.dk (K. Tylén).  2009; Wyman et al., 2009), etc. This raises fundamental questions concerning the neuro-cognitive resources involved in appraising symbolic artifacts.  Previous brain-imaging studies have focused on the distinction between social versus non-social, or animate versus inanimate stimuli, and report dissociable networks of brain areas in reaction to these categories (Caramazza and Shelton, 1998; Gobbini et al., 2011; Naselaris et al., 2012). For instance the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex has been suggested to activate only when participants make judgments about other people and not objects (Jack et al., 2013; Mitchell et al., 2002, 2005). The assumption behind these studies is that stimuli come in ontologically pre-deﬁned categories – for instance objects are non-social, while people are social – and patterns of functional brain activations are interpreted according to these pre-speciﬁed categories.  It has previously been found that experimental participants engage different networks of the social brain in response to questions of ‘how?’ and ‘why?’ when presented with the same social stimulus (such as an agent performing and action, Spunt and Adolphs, 2014; Spunt et al., 2010; Spunt and Lieberman, 2012, 2014; Spunt et al., 2011). In a similar vein, the double nature of symbolic artifacts potentially affords different modes of engagements: they are simultaneously physical entities and vehicles of non-tangible complex cultural meanings (Clark, 2006; Cussins, 1992; Hutchins, 2005), and this implies that they might give rise to distinctive patterns of functional brain activations according to how they are approached. Additionally, while their physical nature is easily appreciable, their social meaning is often not  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.03.056 1053-8119/© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Tylén et al. / NeuroImage 134 (2016) 105–112  fully transparent to the casual newcomer but critically depends on participation in cultural practices and trajectories of actual use in social interactions (Hutchins, 2008; Tylén et al., 2013).  In this study we set out to investigate the neurocognitive bases of our engagements with cultural artifacts. In particular, we are interested in the extent to which our perception of such objects is affected by the functional context (what aspects of the object that are actualized in a given task or situation) and the social history in which the object is embedded. More speciﬁcally, we hypothesize that functional brain activation will be modulated by i) the interpretive attitude by which we approach the objects (as physical entities or as meaningful symbols), and ii) by our familiarity with the socio-cultural practices constituting the meaning of the objects. In other words, if socially symbolic dimensions are contextually actualized, we expect objects to evoke activity in the brain areas related to social cognition (such as e.g. mPFC and TPJ, Frith, 2007; Frith and Frith, 2006b; Lieberman, 2007; Tylén et al., 2012; Walter et al., 2004) and semantics (Hagoort, 2005; Jung-Beeman, 2005; Tylén et al., 2009). Furthermore, we expect this activity to be modulated by participation in the social history of the object (Mano et al., 2011). In contrast, if the bare physical properties of the same artifacts are proﬁled, we expect them to activate areas related to object recognition and manipulation, such as ventral temporal and motor areas (Bar et al., 2001; Binkofski et al., 1999).  To investigate these predictions we designed a two-part study in which participants were instructed to individually and collectively build objects out of LEGO bricks that would illustrate their understanding of abstract concepts. On the following day participants were shown pictures of LEGO models built by themselves or others while their brains were scanned with fMRI. In the scanner they were given assignments that primed them to perceive the LEGO constructs either as bare physical structures or as vehicles of socially constituted meaning.  Materials and methods  Participants  30 participants were recruited among students of Aarhus University and participated in the ﬁrst part of the two-day experiment. Among these three dropped out at day two (before the fMRI experiment), while two participants were excluded due to technical problems during the imaging process. The remaining twenty-ﬁve participants (13 f. mean age 24, sd 2.7) were all right-handed, native speakers of Danish, with no history of neurological or mental problems. Informed consent was obtained in a manner approved by the local research ethical committee. Participants received a monetary compensation for their participation.  Design and procedure  The experiment was carried out as a two-part study over two days. On the ﬁrst day, participants were engaged in individual and collective LEGO construction activities. On the following day, participants went through an fMRI brain scan in which they were subjected to photographic stimuli depicting the products of the preceding day's individual and collective LEGO constructions.  The LEGO construction activity  The ﬁrst day's LEGO construction activity was organized as a twocondition within-group contrast: collective vs. individual. Participants were organized in mixed-gender groups of four to six. Group members did not know each other in advance. Participants of each group were organized around a table facing each other (see Fig. 1). Two simpler practice trials served to familiarize them with each other and the LEGO materials. After that, groups underwent an interleaved series of six individual and six collective LEGO construction tasks of each ﬁve minutes. In the construction tasks, participants were instructed to use LEGO bricks  Fig. 1. Experimental setup for the LEGO construction activity. Group members were arranged around a table facing each other. In individual trials they each were given a ﬁxed set of LEGO bricks and an A5 piece of cardboard on which to build their model. In collective trials group members shared one LEGO set and built their shared model on one piece of cardboard.  to illustrate their understanding of six abstract concepts: ‘responsibility’, ‘collaboration’, ‘knowledge’, ‘justice’, ‘safety’ and ‘tolerance’. The concepts were selected to be challenging to build, yet sufﬁciently common in public discourse that participants would have an opinion about them. The LEGO materials were in all cases a LEGO Serious Play Starter Kit consisting of 214 mixed pieces (standards bricks in varying shapes and colors, wheels, LEGO people, etc.). In order to constrain variability in complexity and size of the models, participants were instructed to build their models within the limits of an A5 (5.8 × 8.3 in.) piece of cardboard (for examples of LEGO creations, see Fig. 2).  In individual trials, participants sat quietly and constructed their own models. In collective trials participants freely interacted to construct joint models. After each trial, participants were asked to brieﬂy explain their model. The experiment was divided in two 3-concepts sessions separated by a 20 min break. Two video cameras consecutively recorded the construction activities and after each construction trial the resulting LEGO models were photographically documented with a Canon digital camera. The videos of the construction activities were analyzed with different purposes in other studies (Bjørndahl et al., 2014, 2015). By the end of the experiment, participants ﬁlled in the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (Ryan, 1982) addressing their experience of the collaborative activity. In particular we were interested in the factors Relatedness and Group Competence, both of which capture central aspects of the quality of social interaction. Notice that since one participant did not ﬁll in the questionnaire these analyses only have twenty-four observations.  The fMRI study  On the following day, participants came back to the lab individually for an fMRI brain scanning session. In the scanner, they were presented with photographic stimuli depicting LEGO models from the construction activities. These belonged to four conditions 1) models that the participant made with her group, 2) models that the participant made individually, 3) models made by another group, and 4) models made by another individual (from another group). Furthermore, each stimulus presentation would be accompanied by one of two rating tasks: a ‘meaning property’ and a ‘physical property’ tasks. The tasks were intended to modulate participants' attitude to the stimuli, inspecting the models for either their meaning potentials, which critically depended on their complex social histories, or their bare physical structure that did not – to the same extent – depend on memories of their creation. Together the conditions and tasks make up a 2-by-2-by-2 factorial design with the factors ‘collective — individual’, ‘own — other’ and ‘meaning — physical’.  K. Tylén et al. / NeuroImage 134 (2016) 105–112  107  Fig. 2. Examples of stimulus LEGO models. A: Collective model illustrating “Collaboration”. B: Collective model illustrating “Justice”. C: Collective model illustrating “Responsibility”. D: Collective model illustrating “Knowledge”.  In the meaning related task, participants would ﬁrst see a prompt (1.5 s) indicating that they would be subjected to a meaning related task followed by a ﬁxation cross (1 s). Thereafter they would see one of the six target concepts (‘responsibility’, ‘safety’ etc.) written on the screen (2 s), then a ﬁxation cross (1 s), followed by an image of a LEGO models depicting this target concept (3 s). After a ﬁxation cross with a random jitter of 3–5 s, participants would be prompted to rate the model on a 6-point scale from “not well” to “very well” in response to the question “How well do you think this model represents the concept X?” After submitting their response, participants would see a ﬁxation cross with a random jitter of 3–5 s before they proceeded to the next trial. If participants failed to submit their response within 5 s, it would time-out and they would proceed to the next trial (see Fig. 3A). In the physical property related task, participants would ﬁrst see a prompt indicating that they would be subjected to a physical property task (1.5 s) followed by a ﬁxation cross (1 s). Then they would be presented with an image of one of the LEGO models from one of the four conditions (3 s). After a ﬁxation cross (random jitter 3–5 s), they were prompted to rate the model on a 6 point scale from “fragile” to “robust” in response to the question “How fragile/robust do you ﬁnd this model?” Like in the meaning related task the trial would proceed with the participant's submission or time-out after 5 s (see Fig. 3B).  In both types of rating tasks, participants performed their rating by moving a cursor to the desired value on the rating scale by tapping a response box button with the right hand index ﬁnger and then submit the decision using the right-hand middle ﬁnger.  All LEGO models were presented twice from two different perspectives in a randomized order through 96 trials (48 belonging to the meaning and 48 to the physical rating condition). Stimulus presentation and response recording were carried out using Cogent 2000 for MATLAB (Mathworks Inc. Sherborn, MA).  fMRI acquisition parameters and analysis  We used a 3 T Siemens TIM Trio MRI system with a 12 channel head coil to acquire the T2* weighted gradient echo, echo-planar images (EPI) with Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) contrast using the following parameters: echo time (TE): 30 ms, repetition time (TR): 3000 ms, and a ﬂip angle of 90°. Six hundred twenty wholebrain images were obtained over ﬁfty-six sequential, interleaved 2.5 mm axial slices with a 3 × 3 mm resolution and a ﬁeld of view of 192 × 192 mm in one scanning session lasting approx. 25 min.  All fMRI data analyses were conducted using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London) implemented in MATLAB R2013b using default settings unless otherwise speciﬁed. Images were spatially realigned, normalized to the MNI template and smoothed with an isotropic 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Statistical analysis was conducted following a two-level general linear model approach (Penny and Holmes, 2007). On the ﬁrst-level, single participant task-related BOLD responses were modeled for each subject by convolving condition onsets and durations with the standard hemodynamic response function, and effects for each condition were estimated using a general linear model approach. Only responses to the stimulus presentation itself (images of LEGO models) were explicitly modeled in the fMRI analysis. The main contrast concerned perception of the LEGO models in the meaning-related versus the physical property-related task. Then, for the meaning related task, main and interaction effects of the four conditions were modeled. Besides the analysis included standard regressors for the six SPM8 motion parameters and a high-pass ﬁlter set to 128 s cut off. Contrast images from the ﬁrst-level analysis went into a second-level, random effects group analysis using the one-sample t-tests in SPM8. The signiﬁcance threshold for all main effects was set to p b .05, FDR corrected for multiple  108  K. Tylén et al. / NeuroImage 134 (2016) 105–112  Table 1 Anatomical regions and coordinates.

The reported interaction effects were masked with the main effect of the meaning-related task using the small volume correction function in SPM, thresholded at p b .01, FEW corrected for multiple comparisons. All corrections were carried out at the peak voxel level following the recommendations of Friston et al. (1995). Functional images were overlaid with the standard SPM8 single subject high resolution T1 image.  While the preceding analyses among other things test for effects of seeing one's own versus other's models, we were also interested in whether particular qualities of the collaboration with fellow group members would modulate brain activity in response to own collective models. In order to assess if individual differences in participants' experiences of interaction predicted variability in brain responses to the LEGO models, we conducted an analysis testing participants' self-reported ratings of relatedness and group competence against their brain activity in the interaction effect (collective N individual ∗ own N other). This was done by explorative plotting the peak contrast estimates from the interaction effect as a function of individual ratings of relatedness and group competence implemented as user speciﬁed ordinates in SPM8. Since the ratings were not normally distributed, the relations were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation rho calculated in R 3.2. (RStudio Team, 2015).  Results  fMRI results  Contrasting the ‘meaning’ N ‘physical property’ related task yielded patterns of activation in a bilateral network of brain areas comprising mainly the dorso-medial PFC, TPJ, and inferior frontal gyrus (see Table 1A for peak voxels and stats and Fig. 4A). The opposite contrast, ‘physical property’ N ‘meaning’ related task, yielded activations in the  right precentral gyrus, the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, and the primary occipital cortex bilaterally (Table 1B and Fig. 4B). The four factorial conditions were tested separately for the two tasks. For the meaning related task, the contrast ‘own’ N ‘other’ activated the right medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, left TPJ and precuneus (see Table 1C and Fig. 4C). The opposite contrast, ‘other N own’ and both main effects of collective/individual did not yield above threshold results, however the interaction ‘own’ N ‘other’ × ‘collective’ N ‘individual’ activated a network comprising left anterior cingulate cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus and left insula (see Table 1D and Fig. 5a). Explorative plotting of contrast estimates in the global peak voxel (rostral ACC) suggests that the interaction effect is driven primarily by the activation caused by participation in collective LEGO constructions (see Fig. 5b).  Analyzing the relation between participants' subjective assessments of the collaboration and the brain activity during the meaning related task showed that variability in left insula was signiﬁcantly predicted by the feeling of relatedness to fellow group members, rs(23) = 0.43, R2 = 0.19, p b 0.05 (see Fig. 5c). No other above threshold effects was found.  Discussion  We found differential patterns of brain activation when participants were primed to perceive LEGO models as physical constructs (rating their fragility) and when they approached them as vehicles of socially constituted meaning (rating their meaning potentials). Rating the fragility of a LEGO model calls special attention to its physical surface structure and might imply imagining to haptically manipulate it. Correspondingly, we found the fusiform gyrus bilaterally and areas of right pre-central gyrus to be activated in this task. Both sites have previously been found related to perception of physical objects (Shmuelof and Zohary, 2005). While the fusiform gyrus is mostly associated with object recognition and categorization (Bar et al., 2001; Chao et al., 1999; Gauthier et al., 1999; Grill-Spector, 2003; Whitehead et al., 2009), motor areas have been related to mental object manipulation (Vanrie et al., 2002).  In contrast, rating the meaning potentials of the models requires participants to pay special attention to the expressive qualities of the models, which implies recalling the particular social practices in which  K.

This task was found to activate a bilateral network of areas comprising dorso-medial prefrontal cortex, temporal pole, TPJ and IFG. The mPFC and TPJ are consistently found in studies of social cognition and interaction, and generally associated with mentalizing, agency, and ascription of intentionality (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Frith and Frith, 2006a; Iacoboni et al., 2004; Van Overwalle, 2009). Interestingly, previous studies have claimed mPFC to only activate when participants make judgments about other people and not objects (Mitchell et al., 2002, 2005). We suggest that the meaning-related rating task directed participants' attention to semantic dimensions of the stimulus models constituted by their particular social history and that this gave rise to the activation patterns in mPFC and TPJ (Gallagher et al., 2000; Mano et al., 2011; Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003; Schaefer and Rotte, 2010). Similar effects have been observed in a study of pretense play (Whitehead et al., 2009). Here participants saw actors using objects in canonical ways (for instance using a tennis racket to hit a ball) and in sequences of pretense play (using the tennis racket as a banjo). When later prompted to name the pretend objects participants showed activations in mPFC, suggesting that these locally constituted meanings of the object relied more on areas sensitive to social intentions. Our ﬁndings are also consistent with Baetens et al.'s suggestion that the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is involved with so-called ‘high construal’ of both social (persons) and non-social (objects) stimuli (Baetens et al., 2013, 2015). High construal involves selective focus on a few essential properties of a stimulus to infer properties (traits, category-membership etc.) that are not part of the direct perceptual experience of the stimulus. In  other words, we infer more abstract type-membership from presentations of concrete tokens. Baetens et al. even speculate that high construal more generally reﬂects the ‘meaning’ of the stimuli, as opposed to their individual properties. This corresponds to our ﬁnding that the dmPFC is selectively activated when the LEGO models are appreciated for their meaning in contrast to their bare physical properties.  We also found activations of the IFG bilaterally and the right temporal pole. IFG, particularly in the left hemisphere, is traditionally considered a “language area” and consistently shows up in studies on verbal semantics (Newman et al., 2001, 2003; Rodd et al., 2005). However, recent studies suggest generalizing the function of IFG to semantic aspects of other modalities of communication and expressivity as well. For instance, the IFG has been found in studies of hand gestures (Dick et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2009), facial expressions (Jabbi and Keysers, 2008), music (Vuust et al., 2005), as well as studies on symbolic objects (Tylén et al., 2009). It is often noticed that in case of non-verbal (or complex verbal) stimuli, bilateral activation patterns are more prevalent, suggesting higher processing demands due to differential levels of complexity, conventionalization or expertise (Tylén et al., 2009; Vuust et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2009). The temporal poles are also often related to aspects of verbal semantics (Kumfor et al., 2016; Price, 2010). While most studies report left temporal pole activity, some studies suggest a special role for the right homolog in relation to more ﬁgurative and pragmatic aspects of meaning (Diaz et al., 2011; Diaz and Hogstrom, 2011). We suggest that the activation of IFG in this experiment is related to the way participants explore the LEGO models to make assessments of their meaning potentials (rather than their mere physical attributes). This involves reading the models as communicative signs not unlike  110  K. Tylén et al. / NeuroImage 134 (2016) 105–112  Fig. 5. The interaction effect ‘collective N individual ∗ own N other’. A: fMRI activation sites, p b 0.05, FWE small volume corrected, B: Explorative plotting of contrast estimates in ACC. The plot suggests that the effect is mainly driven by the contrast between collective/own N collective/other. Error bars represent 95% conﬁdence intervals.

The involvement of the right temporal pole might be related to the fact that the models often would represent their abstract target concepts in a ﬁgurative or metaphoric fashion.  In the meaning-related condition, we found a strong main effect of participation – that is – seeing models that the participant had constructed herself individually or with her group in contrast to models built by other individuals/groups. Making assessments of your own collective and individual models may depend more on episodic memory traces: the participant's judgments of the meaning related properties of the models rely in part on personal recollections of the preceding building activities and discussions and perhaps though to a lesser extent on semantic memory and processing. Accordingly, this contrast yielded activation in social cognition areas such as mPFC, anterior cingulate, and left TPJ. This replicates ﬁndings from previous studies investigating the contrast between self-generated and other generated texts (Mano et al., 2011) and studies of the extended self (perceiving own versus  others' objects, Kim and Johnson, 2014). Interestingly, we do not ﬁnd the meaning-related pattern of IFG activation in this contrast, which suggests that IFG is involved in more general explorations of meaning across own and others' models. However, we observed additional activations of left precuneus, an area consistently found in studies of autobiographical memory and experience of agency (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Maddock et al., 2001).  We did not observe a main effect of collective N individual models, which is unsurprising due to the fact that this distinction was hard to discern in half of the cases, those belonging to the ‘other’ condition. However, the collective versus individual factor interacts signiﬁcantly with the own versus other factor: When participants made assessments of their own collective models (in contrast to other's/individual), we found activation in the anterior cingulate, the right IFG and the left insula. Explorative plotting of contrast estimates (see Fig. 5b) suggests that this effect is mainly driven by the own-other contrast within collective LEGO constructions, while contrasting individual models did not  K. Tylén et al. / NeuroImage 134 (2016) 105–112  111  evoke strong differences. The insula is interesting in this respect as it is often associated with social emotions (Phan et al., 2002) and empathy (Singer, 2006; Singer and Lamm, 2009). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the insula forms a network with the anterior cingulate cortex sensitive to the saliency of stimuli and events (Menon and Uddin, 2010). It is likely that the more arousing character of collective building activities (in contrast to individual building activities) might make these models more salient to the participant and thus evoke stronger insula and anterior cingulate activations (Fusaroli et al., in press). This is further supported by the ﬁnding that variability in left insula activity is signiﬁcantly predicted by individual differences in the feeling of relatedness to fellow group members as assessed right after the LEGO construction activities through the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (Ryan, 1982). The stronger the participants rate their relations to fellow members of the group, the higher the contrast estimates in insula suggesting that insula activity is related especially to the socially emotional history of the models.  Together, our ﬁndings show how our perception of even static, material objects can activate the brain areas traditionally thought to be involved only in perception of social behaviors, intentionality ascription and mentalizing. This happens when the objects are designed and recruited as vehicles of socially constituted meaning through local cultural practices. The ﬁndings thus support a view according to which human social life extends far beyond face-to-face interactions. We actively construct, exchange, and otherwise surround ourselves with material structures richly imbued with social meaning. In this fashion, human interactions establish, maintain and develop composite neuro-cognitive trails in our minds and environments. These persistent cognitive trails enable evolutionarily unprecedented socio-cultural complexity, accumulation and exchange. Our study thus contributes to discussions of the articulated nature of human socio-cultural cognition and in particular the hybrid nature of symbolic artifacts — as simultaneously material (LEGO models) and neurocognitive trails of social interactions and practices (Hutchins, 2008; Tylén et al., 2009).  Conclusions  In this study we investigated the neurocognitive status of symbolic artifacts. Together our ﬁndings support the idea that symbolic artifacts are simultaneously physical objects and vehicles for non-tangible social meanings. Very different neurocognitive processes are involved in attending to physical features and social meanings, and in the latter case they are modulated by a history of social engagement of the object. Symbolic artifacts might thus be conceived as material and neurocognitive trails of social interactions and cultural meanings.

One potential mechanism is that the anticipation of guilt can motivate cooperative behavior. We utilize a formal model of this process in conjunction with fMRI to identify brain regions that mediate cooperative behavior while participants decided whether or not to honor a partner’s trust. We observed increased activation in the insula, supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and temporal parietal junction when participants were behaving consistent with our model, and found increased activity in the ventromedial PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and nucleus accumbens when they chose to abuse trust and maximize their ﬁnancial reward. This study demonstrates that a neural system previously implicated in expectation processing plays a critical role in assessing moral sentiments that in turn can sustain human cooperation in the face of temptation.  INTRODUCTION  Daily life confronts us on a regular basis with social situations in which we sometimes place trust in those around us or alternately are entrusted by others. Often, this takes the form of informal agreements, with the promise of beneﬁts to all concerned if mutual trust is upheld. As an example, imagine we are in a coffee shop, and another customer asks us to watch over her laptop as she steps outside to make a phone call. Assuming we repay this trust and do indeed protect her laptop, it is clear what the beneﬁt to her is. But what is in it for us? These everyday informal situations are a mainstay of our social life, but there is surprisingly little experimental research examining the question of what motivates this behavior. Indeed, although we may painstakingly deliberate the merits of entering a formal legal contract, we rarely give much thought to the psychological foundations of these more  560 Neuron 70, 560–572, May 12, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  mundane arrangements. However, these decisions serve as the foundation for a safe (Sampson et al., 1997) and economically successful society (Smith, 1984; Zak and Knack, 2001), and thus increased knowledge of the neural structures that underlie these behaviors can provide valuable clues into the mechanisms that underlie these behaviors of trust and reciprocity.  Understanding the dynamic processes of strategic interactions has traditionally been under the purview of the ﬁeld of economics. Classical models of human behavior have typically assumed that people maximize their own material self-interest; however, a host of experimental evidence demonstrates that people appear to care about the payoffs of others (Camerer, 2003). This insight has consequently resulted in the development of a number of models that emphasize other-regarding preferences. These models typically consider either the distribution of payoffs (Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000; Fehr and Schmidt, 1999) or other player’s intentions (Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger, 2004; Falk and Fischbacher, 2006; Rabin, 1993) and posit that cooperation occurs largely as the result of a positive, prosocial motivation (Fehr and Camerer, 2007).  An alternative mechanism underlying trust and reciprocity that has received considerably less empirical attention concerns the inﬂuence of affective state on interactive decision making, speciﬁcally the role of anticipated guilt in deciding to help others. Guilt can be conceptualized as a negative emotional state associated with the violation of a personal moral rule or a social standard (Haidt, 2003) and is particularly salient when one believes they have inﬂicted harm, loss, or distress on a relationship partner, for example when one fails to live up to the expectations of others (Baumeister et al., 1994). Acting to minimize guilt can thus be a powerful motivator in the decision-making process. According to this proposal, we may be particularly vigilant of our neighbor’s laptop, not because of any prosocial feeling, but rather because we anticipate feeling terrible if anything happened when the owner expected us to care for it. Supporting this idea, some research has demonstrated that people are indeed guilt averse and in fact often do make decisions to minimize their anticipated guilt regarding a social interaction. While these studies have provided evidence that beliefs about others’ expectations motivate cooperative behavior (Charness and Dufwenberg, 2006; Dufwenberg and Gneezy, 2000; Reuben  Neuron  Neural Basis of Guilt Aversion  et al., 2009; but see also Ellingsen et al., 2010) and that speciﬁcally thinking about a guilty experience can promote greater levels of cooperation (Ketelaar and Au, 2003), no study to date has directly demonstrated that guilt avoidance is the mechanism that underlies these decisions to cooperate. However, sophisticated methods from neuroscience such as fMRI can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms.  It is important to note that there is at present very limited understanding of how complex social emotions such as guilt are instantiated in the brain. The few previous studies investigating the neural underpinnings of this mechanism have employed methods which may not realistically evoke natural feelings of guilt, such as script-driven imagery (e.g., ‘‘remember a time when you felt guilt’’) (Shin et al., 2000) or imaginary vignettes (e.g., ‘‘I shoplifted a dress from the store’’) (Takahashi et al., 2004). Because we contend that that the anticipation of guilt can motivate prosocial behavior, it is critical to explore how guilt impacts decision making while participants are actually undergoing a real social interaction. According to our conceptualization of guilt, people balance how they would feel if they disappointed their relationship partner against what they have to gain by abusing their trust. It is possible that during this process people may even experience a preview of their future guilt at the time of the decision, which may be what ultimately motivates them to cooperate.  Therefore, the present study attempts to address these questions by integrating theory and methods from the diverse ﬁelds of psychology, economics, and neuroscience to understand the neural mechanisms that mediate cooperative behavior. We utilize a formal model of guilt aversion (Battigalli and Dufwenberg, 2007) developed within the context of Psychological Game Theory (PGT; Battigalli and Dufwenberg, 2009; Geanakoplos et al., 1989), which provides a mathematical framework to allow individual utility functions to encompass beliefs—a feature essential for modeling emotions. Importantly, using a formal model provides a precise quantiﬁcation of the amount of guilt anticipated in each decision, and can be used to predict brain networks that track this signal. The use of computational models has been instrumental in understanding the neural systems underlying complex cognitive constructs involved in decision making such as prediction error (O’Doherty et al., 2004), uncertainty (Preuschoff et al., 2006), and mentalizing (Hampton and O’Doherty, 2007). This approach provides a principled method for both illuminating the neural responses to feelings of guilt and also exploring how they directly guide social decision making.  For example, consider how behavior might be modeled in the commonly-studied Trust Game (TG) (Berg et al., 1995) using a guilt-aversion model. In this game, a player (the Investor) must decide how much of an endowment to invest with a partner (the Trustee – see Figure 1A). Once transferred, this money is multiplied by some factor (often 3 or 4), and then the Trustee has the opportunity to return money back to the Investor. If the Trustee honors trust, and returns money, both players end up with a higher monetary payoff than originally endowed. However, if the Trustee abuses trust and keeps the entire amount, the Investor takes a loss. The standard economic solution to this game uses backward induction and predicts that a rational and selﬁsh Trustee will never honor the trust given by the Investor, and the Investor realizing this, should never place trust in the ﬁrst  place, and will invest zero in the transaction. In contrast, our model of guilt aversion posits that a rational Trustee is interested in both maximizing their ﬁnancial payoff (M2) and minimizing their anticipated guilt associated with letting their partner down. Anticipated guilt can be operationalized as the nonnegative difference between the amount of money the Investor expects back (E1S2) and the amount that the Trustee actually returns (S2). Because the Trustee typically does not know the Investor’s true belief, their expectation of this belief, referred to as their second order belief (E2E1S2), can be used as a proxy.  U2 = M2   Q12ðE2E1S2   S2Þ +  (1)  According to this model, the Trustee’s anticipated guilt is thus based on their second order beliefs. The weight placed on anticipated guilt in the utility function is modulated by a guilt sensitivity parameter (Q12), which can vary for each partner the Trustee encounters. Participants make decisions, which maximize this utility function. If they are sufﬁciently guilt averse (Q12 > 1), then they will maximize their utility by returning the amount that they expect their partner will return, otherwise (Q12 < 1) they will receive the most utility from keeping all of the money (see Figure S1 available online for a simulation).  it  is important  While a number of studies have investigated the neural systems underlying Investor’s initial decisions to trust (Delgado et al., 2005; King-Casas et al., 2005; Krueger et al., 2007), there have been surprisingly few that have studied the Trustee’s corresponding decisions to cooperate (Baumgartner et al., 2009; van den Bos et al., 2009). Previous work has found evidence that decisions to cooperate in an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Game are associated with the ventral striatum (Rilling et al., 2002). However, to note that decisions to cooperate in sequential games (i.e., the TG) may be fundamentally different from those in simultaneous-move games (i.e., Prisoner’s Dilemma Game) because of the ability to visibly choose before the other player in the former (McCabe et al., 2000, 2003). Neuroscientiﬁc investigations of the TG have shown that decisions to abuse trust are associated with activity in the vmPFC and PCC (van den Bos et al., 2009). This study also observed interesting individual differences indicating that when making selﬁsh decisions, trust abusers exhibit more activity in the ventral striatum and less activity in the insula, as compared to cooperators. These results suggest that decisions to betray trust by trust abusers may be motivated by reward-related regions such as the ventral striatum and vmPFC, while decisions to cooperate may be associated with the insula for cooperators. Another study of Trustee behavior has focused on honoring promises to reciprocate rather than cooperation per se (Baumgartner et al., 2009). Here, the authors found that dishonest participants had greater amygdala activation as compared to honest participants when deciding whether or not to reciprocate their partner’s trust. While both of these studies examining Trustee behavior have provided important insights into their respective questions of interest, neither has provided evidence directly addressing the speciﬁc mechanism that underlies the decision to cooperate in these interactive scenarios.  The aim of the present study is to use a theory-driven approach to examine the neural processes associated with  Neuron 70, 560–572, May 12, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc. 561  Neuron  Neural Basis of Guilt Aversion  Figure 1. Trial Timeline (A) Schematic of Trust Game (TG) with beliefs. Player 1 decides how much of their endowment they want to invest in Player 2 (S1) and has an expectation about the amount of money that Player 2 will return (E1S2). The amount that Player 1 invests is multiplied by a factor of 4 by the experimenter. Player 2 has a belief about Player 1’s expectation (E2E1S2) and decides how much money to return back Player 1 (S2).

After making an investment to every player, they were also asked how much of this amount (multiplied by 4) they believed their partner would return to them.

Participants’ beliefs about their partner’s offer were then recorded (C) and then the actual offer was revealed (D).

During the TG they received the actual offers made by each Investor during Session 1 (see Figure 1 for a trial timeline of both sessions). After learning about the amount of money player 1 sent, we ﬁrst elicited the Trustee’s second-order beliefs about the amount of money that they believed the Investor expected them to return (E2E1S2). Participants could then return any amount of their multiplied investment in 10% increments (S2). At the conclusion of Session 2, all participants were shown a recap of each round, and their subjective counterfactual guilt was assessed (see methods).  RESULTS  Behavioral Results Our behavioral results demonstrated that participants behaved in a similar fashion to previous TG experiments (Camerer, 2003; Figure 2). The Investor usually sent some amount of their endowment to the Trustee, with the Trustee being quite accurate in predicting this investment (mixed effects regression, twotailed; b = 0.15, se = 0.06, t = 2.29, p = 0.02). The Trustee was also generally accurate in predicting the Investors’ expectations (b = 0.85, se = 0.06, t = 15.20, p < 0.001; Figure 3A). Supporting our model of guilt aversion, the Trustee used these expectations to guide their decision-making behavior, as they typically returned close to the amount of money that they believed their partner expected them to return (b = 0.90, se = 0.04, t = 21.32, p < 0.001; Figure 3B). Finally, participants reported that they  guilt-motivated cooperation while the decision maker is immersed in a real, consequential interaction. As modeled by Equation 1, we elicit the participants’ expectations and utilize them to isolate the neural systems involved in the anticipation of guilt. We predicted that the motivation to minimize anticipated guilt would induce participants to cooperate and that these cooperative decisions would therefore be associated with greater activity in the insula/acc and amygdala, based on previous studies of both guilt (Shin et al., 2000) and general negative affect (Calder et al., 2000; Damasio et al., 2000).  Thirty participants were recruited to play multiple single-shot rounds of a TG split over two sessions. Importantly, during this study we employed no deception, and therefore all participant interactions were both real and ﬁnancially consequential. Use of this methodology allows us to examine actual interactions and also account for naturally occurring individual differences in both trust and reciprocity. During Session 1, all participants played as Investor and made an offer to every other participant in the experiment. In addition, we asked each participant to report the amount of money that they expected their partner to return (E1S2). Seventeen of these participants were recruited to play as the Trustee in a subsequent imaging session. During Session 2, each of these participants played 28 single-shot rounds of the TG as the Trustee while undergoing functional  562 Neuron 70, 560–572, May 12, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Neural Basis of Guilt Aversion  Figure 2.

Taken together, these results suggest that participants behaved in a manner consistent with our model of guilt aversion.  Neuroimaging Results We conducted several different analyses to examine the neural mechanisms underlying guilt aversion. First, a main contrast identiﬁed the neural processes underlying decisions that were consistent with the predictions of the guilt-aversion model (i.e., match expectations or not). Second, we explored processes  that tracked parametrically with the predictions of the model. Third, we examined whether these processes could be explained by individual differences in guilt sensitivity estimated from their subjective counterfactual guilt ratings. Finally, we investigated the functional relationships between regions within the previously identiﬁed networks. Main Contrast To characterize the neural processes underlying the behavioral results, we attempted to isolate the two sources of value in Equation 1—the minimization of anticipated guilt and the maximization of ﬁnancial reward. To do this, we compared trials during the decision phase in which participants returned the exact  Neuron 70, 560–572, May 12, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc. 563  Neuron  Neural Basis of Guilt Aversion  Figure 3.

The duration of the decision phase was modeled as the time to decision. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the response time between trials in which participants matched expectations (mean = 3412.29 ms, sd = 1310.65) as compared to trials in which they returned less than their expectation (mean = 3666.87 ms, sd = 1475.47; b = 0.25, se = 0.14, t = 1.80, p = 0.08). It is important to note that this response time is not particularly meaningful as participants were required to scroll through their choices and the starting point was random (see Experimental Procedures). The contrast, illustrated in Figure 4, revealed increased activity in the insula, supplementary  motor area (SMA), dorsal anterior cingulate (DACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and parietal areas, including the temporal parietal junction (TPJ), when participants matched their second-order beliefs about their partner’s expectations, thus minimizing guilt. Returning less than their second-order belief, and thereby increasing ﬁnancial gain, was associated with greater activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex VMPFC, bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMFPC) (See Table S2 for all identiﬁed regions). Parametric Contrast While the main contrast illustrates regions associated with minimizing expected guilt as compared to maximizing ﬁnancial payoff, an additional question of interest is whether these activations change parametrically as a function of the actual deviation  564 Neuron 70, 560–572, May 12, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Neural Basis of Guilt Aversion  Figure 4.

To address this question we tested a parametric contrast that compared trials in which participants matched expectations to linear deviations from expectations (in 10% increments). Similar to the main contrast, matching expectations was associated with increased activity in the right insula, right DLPFC, SMA, ACC, and precuneous (see Figure 5 and Table S3). Returning incrementally less than expectations was  associated with increased activity in the bilateral NAcc and MPFC (including VMPFC, DMPFC, and ACC).  However, participants systematically made slightly less money in trials in which they matched expectations (mean = $12.28, sd = 5.88) compared to trials in which they returned less than they believed the other player expected ($14.58, sd = 6.79; beta =  2.08, t = 2.53, p < 0.05).

See also Figure S3 and Table S3.  confound and to rule out the possibility that the insula is simply tracking forgone ﬁnancial payoffs rather than guilt aversion, we ran an additional analysis (see Supplemental Information) that allowed us to examine the effect of matching expectations while controlling for the amount of money that subjects return (i.e., their forgone ﬁnancial payoff). Consistent with our interpretation, matching expectations was associated with increased activity in the insula, ACC, SMA, bilateral DLPFC, and TPJ. Regions associated with reward maximization (i.e., returning less than expectations) no longer survived cluster correction after controlling for forgone ﬁnancial rewards, presumably as a consequence of high multicollinearity (see Figure S3 and Table S4). Individual Differences These data support the intriguing possibility suggested by our model that distinct networks may be processing competing motivations to either increase reward or decrease one’s anticipated guilt. To examine this hypothesis further, we employed an individual differences approach in which we explored the relationship between differences in self-reported counterfactual guilt, assessed independently of the game, and our regions of interest across participants (see Figures 4C and S2; Experimental Procedures). Results from a robust regression (onetailed) indicated that increased guilt sensitivity is positively related to increased activity in the insula and SMA (b = 106.92, se = 50.44, p = 0.05 and b = 99.64, se = 46.49, p = 0.02, respectively). That is, participants who reported that they would have felt more guilt had they returned less money showed increased insula and SMA activity when they matched expectations. In contrast, we observed a negative relationship between guilt sensitivity and the NAcc (b =  89.17, se = 44.28, p = 0.03), indicating that participants who reported that they would have experienced no change in guilt had they returned less money demonstrated increased activity in the NAcc when making a decision to maximize their ﬁnancial reward. This effect is anatomically speciﬁc to these regions, as there were no signiﬁcant relationships observed between guilt sensitivity and the right DLPFC, left DLPFC, VMPFC, or DMPFC. Interregional Correlations While we have primarily focused on disentangling the neural systems associated with the motivations underlying decision behavior, we also observed a network of regions that have previ 566 Neuron 70, 560–572, May 12, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  ously been associated with an executive control system (e.g., DLPFC, parietal regions, and SMA) (Miller and Cohen, 2001) when participants matched expectations. Consistent with work that has suggested that the insula and SMA may comprise a distinct network which signals the need for executive control (Sridharan et al., 2008), we observed positive relationships between the insula and SMA across subjects (r(16) = 0.64, p < 0.01) and also between bilateral DLPFC and the SMA (r(16) = 0.74, p < 0.001), but no relationship between the insula and DLPFC (Pearson correlations, two-tailed). These relationships are concordant with previous conceptualizations of PFC functioning (Miller and Cohen, 2001) and suggest that the insula may recruit the dlPFC for increased self-control via the SMA. Finally, we also observed a signiﬁcant negative relationship between activity in the insula and the NAcc across subjects (r(16) =  0.56, p = 0.02), hinting at a possible reciprocal relationship between these two systems, a relationship also predicted by our model.  DISCUSSION  Utilizing a formal game theoretic model of utility maximization involving guilt aversion (Battigalli and Dufwenberg, 2007), we ﬁnd compelling evidence that moral sentiments aid in producing cooperative behavior in a consequential social exchange. Our model formalizes the psychological construct of guilt as a deviation from a perceived expectation of behavior and in turn posits that trust and cooperation may depend on avoidance of a predicted negative affective state. Congruent with our model’s predictions, we observed evidence suggesting that when participants chose whether or not to honor an investment partner’s trust distinct neural systems are involved in the assessment of anticipated guilt and in maximizing individual ﬁnancial gain, respectively. These results provide converging psychological, economic, and neural evidence that a guilt-aversion mechanism underlies decisions to cooperate and demonstrate the utility of an interdisciplinary approach in assessing the motivations behind high-level decision-making.  Our experimental paradigm adds to the standard TG methodology by also eliciting participants’ (second-order) beliefs, allowing us to test the predictions of the guilt-aversion model.  Neuron  Neural Basis of Guilt Aversion  In addition, we did not employ deception, and all participant interactions were ﬁnancially consequential, which importantly allows us to examine real interactions and also account for naturally occurring individual differences in both trust and reciprocity. Consistent with previous work (Charness and Dufwenberg, 2006; Dufwenberg and Gneezy, 2000), our results indicate that participants do indeed engage in mentalizing and are in fact able to accurately assess their partners’ expectations. Further, as proposed by the model, participants use these expectations in their decisions and frequently choose to return the amount of money that they believe their partner expected them to return. Based on the postexperimental ratings that assess counterfactual guilt, we can infer that the motivation to match expectations is guilt aversion. Indeed, participants report that they would have felt more guilt had they returned less money in the game.  The guilt-aversion model explored here is distinct to other models of social preference as it posits that participants can mentalize about their partner’s expectations and that they then use this information to avoid disappointing the partner. In contrast, other models conjecture that people are (1) motivated by a ‘‘warm glow’’ feeling and ﬁnd cooperation inherently rewarding (Andreoni, 1990; Fehr and Camerer, 2007), (2) motivated to minimize the discrepancy between self and others’ payoffs (Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000; Fehr and Schmidt, 1999), or (3) motivated to reciprocate good intentions and punish bad intentions (Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger, 2004; Rabin, 1993). The guilt-aversion model thus provides a different psychological account of cooperation than other models because it incorporates both social reasoning and social emotional processing. The model also makes the interesting prediction that a social emotion is in effect an expectation error signal (Montague and Lohrenz, 2007), which functions to motivate people to behave consistent with shared social expectations. There is preliminary evidence indicating that these different motivations may be mediated by distinct neural systems. For example, altruism may be associated with areas associated with reward processing in the ventral striatum (Rilling et al., 2002). Inequity aversion may be associated with OFC (Tricomi et al., 2010), and intention-based reciprocity may be associated with a theory of mind network including the TPJ and the MPFC (van den Bos et al., 2009).  To understand the neural mechanisms underlying our model, we attempted to dissociate the competing motivations to either minimize guilt or maximize ﬁnancial gain by comparing trials in which participants chose to match their partners’ expectations to trials in which they returned less than they believed their partner expected. Participants exhibited increased activity in the insula, SMA, DACC, DLPFC, and parietal areas, including the TPJ, when they minimized their anticipated guilt by returning the amount of money that they believed their partner expected them to return. These results are consistent with another study which examined Trustee’s decisions to cooperate (van den Bos et al., 2009), indicating that the belief elicitation procedure did not appear to alter the neural processing of cooperative decisions. The insula, SMA, and ACC have been implicated in a number of negative affective states such as guilt (Shin et al., 2000), anger (Damasio et al., 2000), and disgust (Calder et al., 2000) as well as physical pain, social distress  (Eisenberger et al., 2003), and empathy for other’s pain (Singer et al., 2004; see Craig, 2009, for a review). These studies support our conjecture that the prospect of not fulﬁlling the expectations of another can result in a negative affective state, which in turn ultimately motivates cooperative behavior. Finally, it is interesting to note that the neural systems involved in making decisions that minimize anticipated guilt are remarkably similar to those previously demonstrated to be involved in the decision to reject unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game (Sanfey et al., 2003), suggesting that at least one function of this network may be to motivate adherence to shared social expectations (Montague and Lohrenz, 2007). Recent work on decisions to conform to a perceived social norm has uncovered the same network (Berns et al., 2010; Klucharev et al., 2009), which indicates that perhaps the function of this frequently observed network is to track deviations from expectations and bias actions to maintain adherence to the expectation such as a moral rule or social norm. Sanfey et al., (2003) ﬁnd that this network biases behavior to punish norm violators, while we observe here that this network biases behavior to be congruent with a socially shared expectation. This interpretation is consistent with a wealth of work on expectations in other domains of cognitive neuroscience such as novelty detection (Downar et al., 2000), placebo effects (Wager et al., 2004), and error monitoring (Miller and Cohen, 2001), suggesting that the network may be domain general (Dosenbach et al., 2006) and extend to social decision making.  An alternative interpretation of our results is that Trustees feel empathy toward the Investor and anticipate their partner’s anticipated disappointment, which motivates them to cooperate. Empathy (like guilt) is another nebulous construct, though has yet to be formalized. Both empathy and guilt aversion require the ability to represent another’s mental state (i.e., theory of mind) and directly relate to other’s disappointment. However, one crucial distinction between the two constructs is that empathy posits that the Trustee feels the Investor’s anticipated emotion (e.g., disappointment), while guilt-aversion contends that the act of disappointing a partner produces an emotion in the Trustee (e.g., guilt), which is qualitatively different from what the Investor is experiencing. Though our current design cannot parse apart these two interpretations, nor can our imaging results, as both of these constructs likely involve the insula (Singer et al., 2004), future work might attempt to differentiate between these two closely related constructs from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.  When participants returned less than their second-order belief and thereby increased their own ﬁnancial gain, we found activation associated with greater activity in the VMPFC, bilateral NAcc, and DMFPC. These results became even more pronounced when we examined parametric deviations from expectation. Consistent with previous work that has examined decisions to abuse trust (van den Bos et al., 2009), we ﬁnd increased activity in the VMPFC when participants return less than they believe their partner expected and predict that damage to this region would likely impair the ability to form accurate expectations, producing the guilt insensitive pattern of behavior observed in patient work (Krajbich et al., 2009). More broadly, however, these regions (i.e., NAcc and VMPFC) have received  Neuron 70, 560–572, May 12, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc. 567  Neuron  Neural Basis of Guilt Aversion  the DLPFC, insula, or ACC/SMA would result in participants choosing to return less money in the TG, as has indeed recently been demonstrated (Knoch et al., 2009). However, we make the divergent predictions that while disrupting all regions would reduce cooperative behavior, disrupting the DLPFC would still result in an affective response, while disrupting the insula or ACC/SMA would in contrast blunt the experience of guilt. Our results also predict that inaccurate expectations should also inﬂuence cooperative behavior. Overestimating partners’ expectations would result in excessive guilt and enhanced associated insula/ACC/SMA activation, while underestimating partners’ expectations would temper participant’s guilt and insula/ACC/ SMA activation and ultimately reduce their levels of cooperation, which is consistent with ﬁndings with patients with VMPFC damage (Krajbich et al., 2009).  This study demonstrates the synergistic effects of applying a neuroeconomic approach to the study of higher-level sociocognitive-affective processes. Imprecise psychological constructs such as guilt can be formally operationalized using sophisticated economic models. the integration of psychological constructs into economic models can substantially improve their ability to predict actual decision-making behavior, in comparison to classical approaches. Finally, and most importantly, this interdisciplinary approach allows these mathematically quantiﬁed psychological constructs to be examined at the neural level in order to both better specify the theoretical models, as well as further understand the interactions between neural systems.  In turn,  To return to our original example, our results suggest that one reason why we choose to stand guard over a stranger’s possessions for no obvious reward is because signals originating in the insula and SMA remind us that allowing something bad to happen to the laptop, and thus deviating from the owner’s expectations, would lead to strong feelings of guilt in the event of an untimely theft. Ultimately, gaining a greater mechanistic understanding of the microprocesses that can occur at a neural level can help facilitate greater understanding of emergent properties of macro-level interactive behavior that play a vital role in creating and maintaining a harmonious society.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Participants Thirty participants (mean age = 18.5, female = 30%) were recruited from the University of Arizona campus, all of whom were screened for any signiﬁcant health or neurological problems. The experiment was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and consisted of two separate sessions. From this sample, all participants that were eligible to enter the MRI environment (n = 17) were recruited from Session 1 to participate in Session 2 (mean age = 18.5, female = 53%). One participant from session 1 was excluded as a result of erratic responses, and some of one participant’s fMRI data from the second session was lost due to technical reasons. Participants were assumed to be strangers.  Experimental Design At session 1, all participants met as a group, were assigned an identiﬁcation number, and had their individual pictures taken. After the instructions to the game were explained, all pictures were presented one at a time to the entire group. While the pictures were being presented, each participant played in the role of the Investor with the pictured participant and was endowed with  attention for their role in computing value (Rangel et al., 2008) and the anticipation and processing of both primary and secondary reward (Dreher and Tremblay, 2009). In addition, we observed activity in the DMPFC, which has been implicated in mentalizing (Amodio and Frith, 2006) or simulating another’s mental state. This signal may indicate that participants are engaging in reasoning about their partner’s potential reaction to their decision. Together, these results suggest that maximizing one’s utility involves a process of weighing the costs and beneﬁts of letting a relationship partner down.  interest  It is possible that the network associated with matching expectations is tracking forgone ﬁnancial payoffs rather than guilt aversion per se. However, this interpretation is unlikely because we continue to observe activity in the insula when participants match expectations after controlling for the amount of money that participants chose to return. To provide further support for our interpretation that the competing motivations to maximize ﬁnancial gain and minimize anticipated guilt are associated with distinct regions, we examined the relationship between the regions of (as deﬁned by the group analyses) and independently assessed individual differences in guilt sensitivity. Consistent with our interpretation, we ﬁnd that participants who report they would have experienced more guilt had they returned less money demonstrated increased insula and SMA activation when they matched expectations. Conversely, participants who claimed that they would not have experienced any additional guilt had they returned less money showed increased activity in the NAcc when they in fact returned less than they believed their partner expected them to return. This implies that there is individual variability in the way in which anticipated guilt inﬂuences decisions. People who are more guilt sensitive have increased activity in the network associated with moral sentiments, while people with less guilt sensitivity have greater activity in those areas associated with reward and value.  that  Together, our results suggest that participants who are guilt sensitive may experience moral sentiments via the insula and SMA, which signals that they will feel guilty if they believe they let their investment partner down. This notion that feelings can be used as information in the decision-making process has been discussed in other domains of decision making such as risk (Damasio, 1994; Loewenstein et al., 2001; Mellers et al., 1997; Slovic et al., 2002) and regret (Coricelli et al., 2005). According to this framework, people generate anticipated emotions about how they might feel after choosing a particular outcome, which ultimately predicts their decision (Mellers et al., 1997). Interestingly, anticipatory feelings associated with risk have been reliably associated with the anterior insula (Critchley et al., 2001) and ACC (Coricelli et al., 2005), which provides further support for our argument that guilt aversion is generated by a sampling of the sentiment in question and is processed by the cingulo-insular network. Importantly, this extends the notion of anticipatory emotions from individual decision making to social contexts. These feelings originating in the insula may recruit the DLPFC to override the competing motivation to maximize ﬁnancial gain and overall result in participants honoring their partner’s trust and returning their initial investment. If this neural account is accurate, then we would predict that disrupting  568 Neuron 70, 560–572, May 12, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Neural Basis of Guilt Aversion  $10 for the round. After making an investment on the round, they were then asked how much of this amount (multiplied by 4) they believed their partner would return to them. At the end of the session, participants were paid $5 for their participation.  A subset of participants (n = 17) were recruited from Session 1 to participate in the second session, in which they played the TG in the role of the Trustee while being scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each participant had an individually tailored paradigm, in which they decided how much money they wanted to return to the other participants in the experiment, based on these partners’ actual proposals to them from Session 1. Each participant played a total of 28 rounds, distributed over four runs. Each run lasted exactly 7 min including an extra 14 s ﬁxation cross display at the beginning of the run to allow for T1 equilibrium, and another 21 s ﬁxation cross at the end of the run (210 volumes per run). The timeline of events in a typical round can be seen in Figure 1B. The stimuli were presented using E-Prime software via VisuaStim goggles (Resonance Technologies Inc, IL, USA), and participants indicated their answers by using a two-button ﬁber optic response box. Responses changed in 10% increments on each button press. These increments were randomly selected to either increase from $0 or decrease from the maximum amount of money for that round (which varied depending on how much had been sent by the partner), ensuring that the number of button presses was orthogonal to the amount of money selected, removing effects of any motor confounds. After participants selected their chosen amount of money, they used the second button to conﬁrm this response.  After participants completed scanning, they rated their counterfactual guilt by indicating on a 7-point Likert scale the amount of guilt they believed they would have experienced had they returned a different amount of money, and were then paid a $20 participation fee. Finally, at the conclusion of the entire experiment, all participants were paid 50% of their earnings for one randomly selected trial. If participants participated in both sessions, they were paid for two separate trials. Participants in the ﬁrst session that correctly predicted their partner’s behavior for the trial selected received an additional $2 bonus (Charness and Dufwenberg, 2006; Dufwenberg and Gneezy, 2000). Only identiﬁcation numbers were provided at the time of payment, thus ensuring that Trustees’ responses were completely anonymous. No deception was employed in this study.  Data Acquisition Each scanning session included a T1-weighted MPRAGE structural scan (TR = 11 ms, TE = 4 ms, matrix = 256 3 256, slice thickness = 1 mm, gap = 0 mm) and four functional runs. Functional scans were acquired in the axial plane using a 3-shot multiple echo planar imaging (MEPI) GRAPPA sequence which aided in reducing geometric distortions (Newbould et al., 2007). Paramin regions associated with high eters were optimized to maximize signal susceptibility artifact (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe) (Sto¨ cker et al., 2006; Weiskopf et al., 2006) (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 256 ms, matrix = 96 3 96, FOV = 192 mm, slice thickness = 3.0 mm, 42 axial slices).  Data Preprocessing Functional imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed using the FSL Software package 4.1.4 (FMRIB, Oxford, UK). The ﬁrst three volumes of each functional run were discarded to account for T1 equilibrium effects. Images were corrected for slice scan time using an ascending interleaved procedure. Head motion was corrected using MCFLIRT using a six parameter rigid-body transformation. Images were spatially smoothed using a 5 mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. A high-pass ﬁlter was used to cut off temporal periods longer than 66 s. All images were initially coregistered to the participant’s high-resolution structural scan and were then coregistered to the MNI 152 person 2 mm template using a 12 parameter afﬁne transformation. All functional analyses are overlaid on the participants’ average highresolution structural scan in MNI space.  General Analysis Methods A three-level mixed-effects general linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the imaging data. A ﬁrst-level GLM was deﬁned for each participant’s functional run that included a boxcar regressor for each epoch of interest (e.g., decision phase) convolved with a canonical double-gamma hemodynamic  response function (HRF). The duration of epochs in which participants submitted a response were modeled using the participant’s reaction time (Grinband et al., 2008). To account for residual variance, we also included the temporal derivatives of each regressor of interest, the six estimated head movement parameters, and any missed trials as covariates of no interest. The resulting general linear model was corrected for temporal autocorrelations using a ﬁrst-order autoregressive model. A second-level ﬁxed effects model was ﬁt for each subject to account for intrarun variability. For each participant, contrasts were calculated between parameter estimates for different regressors of interest at every voxel in the brain. A third-level mixed-effects model using FEAT with full Bayesian inference (Woolrich et al., 2004) was used to summarize group effects for every speciﬁed contrast. Statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using whole-brain cluster correction based on Gaussian random ﬁeld theory with an initial cluster threshold of Z > 2.3 and a Family Wise Error corrected threshold of p < 0.05 (Worsley et al., 1992). Peristimulus plots used functionally deﬁned ROIs and were calculated by ﬁtting a FIR model using fslroi 2.0 (Poldrack, 2007) and averaging within and then across participants.  Behavioral Analyses All behavioral statistics were computed using the R statistical package (R Development Core Team, 2008). For regressions that included repeated observations, we used the lme4 mixed effects GLM package (Bates et al., 2008). Participants were treated as a random effect with varying intercepts and slopes. We report the regression coefﬁcients (b), standard errors (SE), t values, and p values. Because there is no generally agreed upon method for calculating p values in mixed models, we used two separate methods. First, we calculated the degrees of freedom by subtracting the number of ﬁxed effects from the total number of observations (Kliegl et al., 2007). Second, we generated conﬁdence intervals from the posterior distribution of the parameter estimates using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (Baayen et al., 2008). These methods produced identical results. For robust regressions, we used the rlm function from the MASS package using MM estimation (Venables and Ripley, 2002).  Guilt Sensitivity Estimation Our linear model of guilt aversion (Equation 1) makes sharp predictions about the amount of money that participants should return (see Figure S1 for a simulation). Our model allows for the guilt sensitivity parameter (q12) to vary for every Investor/Trustee interaction. There are two possible maxima of the utility function depending on q12. If participants are completely guilt averse (q12 > 1) then the model predicts they should always match their second-order belief. If they are completely guilt in-averse (q12 < 1) then they should always keep all of the money. Because all participants demonstrated some degree of guilt sensitivity, meaning that no subject always kept all of the money, all participants were classiﬁed as guilt averse and thus we observed no variability in Q12.  Counterfactual Guilt To conﬁrm that participants were actually motivated by anticipated guilt, we elicited their counterfactual guilt for each trial following the scanning session. After displaying a recap of each trial, we asked participants how much guilt they would have felt had they returned a different amount of money. This amount was randomly selected from all choices below and one choice above the amount they actually returned (choices increased or decreased in 10% increments). The deviation from the participant’s actual choice was used to predict the amount of guilt that participants reported that would have felt had they returned that amount using a mixed effects regression. Thus, each participant’s best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000) represent their sensitivity to guilt. Larger slopes indicate that participants reported they would have felt more guilt had they returned less money, revealing a higher degree of guilt sensitivity, while smaller slopes reveal a low degree of guilt sensitivity with participants, indicating little change in the amount of guilt they would have experienced had they returned less money. The regression can be seen in Figure 2C along with each participant’s BLUP.

Analysis 1, Main Contrast To identify regions of the brain that are associated with anticipated guilt as predicted by our model, we examined trials during the return phase in which participants matched expectations by returning the amount of money that they believed their partner expected (n = 207), as compared to trials in which they returned less than they believed their partner expected (n = 183). This allowed us to identify neural systems associated with guilt aversion and also to see systems involved in maximizing ﬁnancial payoffs. For this analysis, we excluded trials by modeling them as covariates of no interest where (1) the partner sent $0, and thus there was no decision for the participant to make (n = 33), (2) the participant returned more than their second order belief (n = 66), and (3) the participants either did not indicate their belief or the amount they wanted to return (n = 20). This model thus included the following 30 regressors:  (1) Face phase (2) Prediction phase (3) Investment phase (4) Belief elicitation phase (5) Decision phase when participants matched their partner’s expecta tions (n = 207)  (6) Decision phase when participants returned 10% less than their  partners’ expectations (n = 99)  (7) Decision phase when participants returned 20% less than their  partners’ expectations (n = 46)  (8) Decision phase when participants returned 30%+ less than their  partners’ expectations (n = 38)  (9) Decision phase when participants returned more than their expecta tions (n = 66)  (10) Summary phase (11) Handed-down-belief phase (12) Missed trials (13–24) Temporal derivatives of regressors 1–12 (25–30) Estimated head movement parameters (6)  We compared trials in which the participant matched their expectations to trials in which they returned less than their expectations (+0.99  0.33  0.33  0.33 for regressors 5–8). The results of this analysis can be seen in Figure 4 and Table S2.  Analysis 2, Parametric Contrast An additional question of interest is whether the activations found above change parametrically as a function of deviation from matching expectations. To address this, we tested a parametric contrast in which we compared trials in which participants matched expectations to a linear deviation in 10% increments Winsorized at 30%. Responses greater than or equal to 30% were grouped together, as these were relatively rare and this procedure ensured that the number of cases were balanced across regressors. This contrast speciﬁcally compared matching expectations to returning 10% less, 20% less, and 30+% less (+6  1  2  3 for regressors 5–8) using the model from Analysis 1 .  Analysis 3, Counterfactual Guilt Correlations To address the hypothesis that regions associated with guilt aversion should become more active as a function of guilt sensitivity, we extracted the average third-level parameter estimates from each of the regions of interest and examined their relationship with our measure of counterfactual guilt. We extracted the average values in the clusters located in the right and left DLPFC, insula, SMA, MOFC, and DMPFC by restricting to voxels that were located both in these clusters and in the respective anatomical masks taken from the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas. Because of the small size of the nucleus accumbens, all voxels located in a bilateral anatomical mask were used regardless of statistical signiﬁcance. We used the individual slopes (BLUPs) from the random effects component of the counterfactual guilt analysis as our metric of guilt sensitivity. Due to the noise of the two metrics (average beta values from a third-level imaging analysis and individual BLUPs from a mixed effects analysis) and non-Gaussian distribution, we  570 Neuron 70, 560–572, May 12, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Neural Basis of Guilt Aversion  Damasio, A.R.

In turn, the level of amygdala activation in response to emotion can be decreased by will, for example by using cognitive emotion regulation strategies. In the present study, 37 female subjects (s-carriers: n =21; l/l-homozygotes: n=16) performed an emotion regulation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether cognitive emotion regulation can modulate the genetically determined amygdala hyperreactivity in 5-HTTLPR short allele carriers. Our results demonstrate that cognitive emotion regulation diminishes the difference in amygdala reactivity to threat-related stimuli between 5-HTTLPR genotype groups. Furthermore, we also provide evidence that the effect of cognitive regulation is mediated through altered coupling between the amygdala and prefrontal regulatory regions. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that while the presence of the 5-HTTLPR short allele leads to heightened responses in the amygdala, cognitive regulation can modify genetically mediated effects upon brain function by volitionally altering prefrontal-amygdala connectivity.  © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  Recent advances in imaging genetics have provided promising new insights into the complex interplay of genes, neural processing and behavior (Esslinger et al., 2009; Green et al., 2008; Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger, 2006). For example, the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is critically involved in emotional processing, stimulating imaging genetic studies of this neuromodulatory system (Hahn and Blakely, 2007). One well-described determinant of this system is the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), which regulates 5-HT reuptake from the synaptic cleft (Hariri and Holmes, 2006). On the molecular level, genetic regulation of 5-HTT mRNA and protein expression is inﬂuenced by a common polymorphism found in the 5-HTT linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) of the serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4. In the presence of at least one short (s) allele, the level of 5-HTT mRNA and 5-HT reuptake in human lymphoblastoid cells is approximately two-fold lower compared with cells that are homozygous for the long (l) allele.  ⁎ Corresponding authors.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.11.078  Genetic variation within the serotonin transporter gene also inﬂuences psychological measures of negative emotionality: in comparison to l/l-homozygotes, the s-carriers show higher neuroticism, harm avoidance, anxiety and depression (Ansorge et al., 2004; Hoefgen et al., 2005; Lesch et al., 1996). In addition, it was assumed that depression mainly developed in those risk allele carriers who had suffered stressful life events (Caspi et al., 2003). The latter ﬁndings however could not be substantiated by two recent meta-analyses (Munafo et al., 2008; Risch et al., 2009).  In contrast to the effects on behavior, the inﬂuence of the serotonin transporter genotype on neurophysiological parameters is more consistent (Munafo et al., 2008). A number of recent studies showed that the amygdala, a key region for emotional processing which is densely innervated by serotonergic neurons (Hariri et al., 2006; Hensler, 2006), is more reactive in s-carriers during the passive perception of negative emotions compared to l-homozygotes (Bertolino et al., 2005; Hariri et al., 2002, 2005; Heinz et al., 2005; Pezawas et al., 2005; Rhodes et al., 2007; Smolka et al., 2007). During passive perception, the 5-HTTLPR genotype was also related to alterations in the functional connectivity between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (Heinz et al., 2005; Pezawas et al., 2005); additional structural differences were found in the amygdala, the dorsolateral (dlPFC) and ventrolateral (vlPFC) prefrontal cortex, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (Canli et al., 2005;  944  D.M. Schardt et al. / NeuroImage 53 (2010) 943–951  Heinz et al., 2005; Pezawas et al., 2005). The observed genotypedependent dysregulations regarding the structure, function and connectivity within the amygdala-prefrontal emotion network are thought to contribute to the increased negative emotionality observed in s-allele carriers (Canli and Lesch, 2007; Hariri and Holmes, 2006). These ﬁndings clearly underscore the relevance of genetic variation within the serotonergic system with respect to the central processing of emotions, despite heterogeneous results regarding the inﬂuence of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on direct measures of 5-HTT central availability. While some studies found that 5-HTT central availability and mRNA levels in midbrain regions are inﬂuenced by the serotonin transporter genotype (Little et al., 1998; Reimold et al., 2007; van Dyck et al., 2004), others failed to ﬁnd an association (Parsey et al., 2006; Shioe et al., 2003). For example, a PET investigation with the radiotracer [11C]McN 5652 found no effect of 5-HTTLPR genotypes on serotonin transporter binding potential in the amygdala (Parsey et al., 2006). This led the authors to conclude that 5-HTTLPR related neural effects cannot be explained by altered serotonin transporter binding but may be due to differences in methylation patterns or changes in maximum velocity in the 5-HTT enzymatic reaction. Since the association between the 5-HTTLPR and central measures of emotional reactivity has however been reliably replicated, it also seems reasonable to assume that a relative loss in serotonin transporter function related to the short variant might have a detrimental effect especially during the development of the neural circuits involved in emotional regulation (Hariri and Holmes, 2006; Parsey et al., 2006). Consistent with this notion, in rodents a disruption in 5-HT functioning during early development entails alterations in neural structure and function, such as for example lasting emotional abnormalities (Esaki et al., 2005; Gaspar et al., 2003).  However, all previous investigations of 5-HTTLPR-dependent effects on the neural processing of emotions have been restricted to passive perception. In turn, the willful employment of cognitive strategies is known to be effective in changing subjective and physiological responses to emotional stimuli. Amygdala activation is effectively reduced during e.g. labeling (Hariri et al., 2003), cognitive reappraisal (Goldin et al., 2008; Ochsner et al., 2002, 2004) and detachment (Beauregard et al., 2001; Levesque et al., 2004) through top–down inﬂuences from the dlPFC and vlPFC, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the parietal cortex. Thus, the question arises if willful emotion regulation is able to alter genetically determined differences in amygdala reactivity. This question is not only relevant within cognitive and clinical neuroscience but also touches questions related to the power of conscious will. Recent years have witnessed a number of studies trying to answer questions related to the power of conscious will not by armchair philosophy but by conducting empirical studies of the will using neuroscientiﬁc means (Bechara, 2005; Haggard, 2008; Soon et al., 2008; Walter, 2001; Wegner, 2004). To investigate the effect that willful cognitive acts have on genetically predisposed emotional processing, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigating the passive perception and explicit regulation of negative and neutral emotional material in female 5-HTTLPR short and long individuals. Since on the one hand the s-allele of the serotonin transporter genotype has been associated with amygdala hyperreactivity (Hariri et al., 2002, 2005), and on the other hand, amygdala BOLD signal is effectively attenuated through cognitive emotion regulation (Beauregard et al., 2001; Goldin et al., 2008; Levesque et al., 2004; Ochsner et al., 2002, 2004), this region was designated our a priori region of interest.  Our primary goal was to evaluate whether a willful effort, i.e. the deliberate use of a cognitive emotion regulation strategy, can reduce the genetically mediated amygdala hyperreactivity to aversive emotional material. We used negative stimuli that evoked either fear or disgust in order to evaluate whether s-allele carriers show increased neural activation to the perception of aversive versus neutral stimuli (Calder et al., 2001; Hariri et al., 2002). Since fear  stimuli are more relevant in the context of anxiety and depression, we hypothesized that amygdala hyperreactivity in the short genotype group is primarily related to the perception of fear and less to the perception of disgust (Hariri et al., 2005; Lau et al., 2009; Schienle et al., 2005). Regarding the effects of emotion regulation on 5HTTLPR-mediated amygdala hyperreactivity, two alternative assumptions arise: as prior work suggests that the dysfunctions within the amygdala-prefrontal emotion network are caused by developmental changes, the bias towards negativity might be unspeciﬁc with respect to the presence or absence of willful efforts. In this case, the s-group should show increased amygdala reactivity during passive perception and less or even no amygdala attenuation during cognitive emotion regulation compared with l/l-homozygotes. On the other hand, cognitive emotion regulation might counteract the genetically determined amygdala hyperreactivity, in which case we should ﬁnd equal or even larger amygdala signal reductions during the regulation of negative affect in s-carriers. To address these questions, we compared the neural responses of the two genotype groups in both the presence and absence of regulation.  Materials and methods  Subject data  Participants  Forty-four right-handed female university students of central European descent with no history of neurological/psychiatric illness or substance abuse participated in the study. Only female subjects were studied to ensure comparability with previous studies on cognitive emotion regulation which were also restricted to females (Drabant et al., 2009; Eippert et al., 2009; Goldin et al., 2008; Ochsner et al., 2002, 2004; Schaefer et al., 2002; Walter et al., 2009) and to avoid confounding effects of genotype and gender (Barr et al., 2004; Mizuno et al., 2006; Staley et al., 2006; Walderhaug et al., 2007). Written informed consent was obtained, and subjects received a ﬁnancial reward for their participation. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Five participants were excluded due to technical problems or excessive movement artifacts and two further participants were excluded following failure of valid 5-HTTLPR genotyping. A total of 37 participants (mean±SD: age M=22.6±2.2) were included in the analyses. For further assessment, neuroticism (N) scores from the NEO-FFI (Costa and McCrae, 1992), Harm Avoidance (HA) from the TCI (Cloninger et al., 1993) and habitual emotion suppression (S) and reappraisal (R) scores from the ERQ (Gross and John, 2003) were collected.  Genotyping  Venous blood samples obtained from all subjects were assessed regarding the genetic variation of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. Genomic DNA was extracted from the EDTA anti-coagulated venous blood samples using standard techniques. Polymerase chain reaction without multiplexing was conducted following previously described methods (Wendland et al., 2006). In a total volume of 20 μl, ∼25 ng of genomic DNA was ampliﬁed in the presence of 1× Promega PCR Master Mix (www.promega.com), with oligonucleotide primers 5-HTTLPR-forw (5′-FAM-TCCTCCGCTTTGGCGCCTCTTCC-3′) and 5-HTTLPR-rev (5′-VIC-TGGGGGTTGCAGGGGAGATCCTG-3′), the sequences of which are given in Wendland et al. (2006). To evaluate genotyping accuracy, 10% of the samples were analysed in duplicate: ampliﬁcation with the oligonucleotide primers of Lesch et al. (1996), stpr5 (5′-GGCGTTGCCGCTCTGAATGC-3′) and stpr3 (5′-GAGGGACTGAGCTGGACAACCAC-3′) and all yielded identical genotypes.  Based on previous reports (e.g. Hariri et al., 2002, 2005), participants were divided into two groups: individuals carrying one (s/l:  D.M. Schardt et al. / NeuroImage 53 (2010) 943–951  945  n=7) or two (s/s: n=14) short alleles were assigned to the s-group, while the l-group was formed by the long allele homozygous individuals (l/l: n=16). The two groups did not differ with respect to age (t[35]=−0.84, p =0.41), trait anxiety (STAI-T t[35]=−1.32, p=0.2) or depression scores (BDI t[35]=0.05, p=0.96).  tilted acquisition and low TE, ensures optimal signal detection especially in the medial temporal cortex and amygdala by limiting partial volume effects due to tissue borders in this region (Merboldt et al., 2001; Weiskopf et al., 2006). A visual inspection of all data sets conﬁrmed excellent BOLD sensitivity in the amygdala.  Imaging  Functional task  The task completed by the participants during the scanning session involved the natural experience of (‘perception’) or active detachment from (‘regulation’) emotional responses following the presentation of emotional stimuli in an event-related design successfully used in prior studies (Staudinger et al., 2009; Walter et al., 2009). Participants viewed fear, disgust and neutral pictures from a standardized stimulus set (Lang et al., 2008), matched for complexity, content, color and brightness. Some additional pictures in the disgust condition were collected by the authors to balance picture content across conditions. During the ‘perception’ condition, participants were instructed to “look at the picture and permit yourself to feel whichever emotional response arises naturally, without trying to alter it”; in the regulation condition, they were to “look at the picture while detaching yourself from any emotional response which may arise by adopting the position of a detached observer, who is not affected by the scene presented in the picture”. Participants were trained outside the scanner until they felt conﬁdent to perform the task during fMRI.  Thirty-two pictures of each valence were presented. Half of the trials of each valence were presented with the perception instruction and the other half with the regulation instruction. Subjects completed four sessions of 24 trials each: two sessions included unregulated and regulated fear and neutral trials; the other two sessions included unregulated and regulated disgust and neutral trials. The sessions containing fear and disgust were presented in alternating order; and the order of sessions was counterbalanced across subjects (i.e. half of the subjects started with a fear session, the other half started with a disgust session). Within each session, trial presentation was pseudorandomized, with no more than two consecutive trials of the same condition. A given trial began with an instruction of 2 s, followed by 8 s of picture presentation, and ended with a ﬁxation of 12 s during which participants were instructed to relax.  After the scanning session, participants ﬁlled in a questionnaire containing all 96 previously presented pictures. They rated the overall valence of each picture (‘1—very unpleasant’ to ‘9—very pleasant’) to test whether aversive pictures were perceived as more negative than neutral pictures. Additional ratings were obtained assessing the overall compliance with the instructed detachment strategy (‘1— never used it’ to ‘9—always used it’) and the success at implementing the strategy (‘1—not at all successful’ to ‘9—very successful’). To ensure that equal attention was paid to both regulated and unregulated pictures, subjects also indicated which strategy they remember to have followed during each picture's presentation.  Functional image acquisition During the functional  image collection, visual stimuli were presented via binocular video goggles (NNL, Bergen, Norway) attached to the head coil and adjusted to ﬁt the subjects' vision. Functional data were collected on a 3-T Siemens Trio with a gradientecho T2⁎-weighted echo-planar imaging sequence. Thirty-one axial slices covering the whole brain volume were acquired (repetition time/echo time [TR/TE] =2000/25 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, ﬁeld of view=210, 64×64 matrix). Slice thickness was 3.3 mm with a gap of 25 %, resulting in an in-plane resolution of 3.3× 3.3×4.125 mm. The slices were tilted by −45°, following an imaginary line from the lower boundary of the orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11) to the lower boundary of the cerebellar nodule. The high in-plane resolution, along with the  Data analysis  Behavioral data  For the pleasantness and memory ratings, repeated-measures ANOVAs were carried out to asses the effects of ‘genotype’ (s-group, l-group), ‘regulation’ (perception [p], regulation [r]) and ‘valence’ (fear [F], disgust [D], neutral [X]). Regarding the compliance and regulation success ratings, the effect of the 5-HTTLRP genotype was assessed by independent-samples t-tests comparing the scores between the s-group and the l-group. Statistical analyses of the behavioral data were thresholded at p b0.05. A Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied where appropriate in the case of non-sphericity.  Functional image processing  Before pre-processing with SPM2 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Institute of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK), the ﬁrst three volumes in each session were discarded to allow for T1 saturation. Functional imaging data analysis was carried out using SPM2 for pre-processing, SPM5 for statistical analyses (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Institute of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) and Matlab 6.5.1 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The images were slice-timed to correct for differences in slice acquisition time, realigned to the ﬁrst volume of the ﬁrst session to correct for head motion, spatially normalized to the standard EPI template and smoothed with an 8-mm FWHM isotopic Gaussian kernel. Serial autocorrelations were accounted for by a ﬁrst order autoregressive model (AR1) and a high-pass ﬁlter with a cut-off of 128 s was applied. Subsequent to pre-processing, a ﬁrst-level ﬁxed-effects model was set up for each participant in SPM5: regressors were created for the instruction phase, the experimental conditions and the ﬁxation period in each of the four sessions. Two sessions for each subject contained fear (permit fear [pF], regulate fear [rF]) as the aversive condition, while the other two sessions contained disgust (permit disgust [pD], permit regulate disgust [rD]) as the aversive condition. Boxcar regressors representing the actual length of each condition in seconds (i.e. 2-s instruction, 8-s picture presentation, 12-s ﬁxation) were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) implemented in SPM5. Movement parameters were also included in the model as regressors of no interest, resulting in a total of 48 regressors.  Predetermined effects of each condition versus ﬁxation were calculated using t-statistics (pF N ﬁx, pD N ﬁx, pX N ﬁx, rF N ﬁx, rD N ﬁx, rX N ﬁx). The individual statistical images were then included in a group-level random-effects model that accounts for both scan-to-scan and subject-to-subject variability. At the group level, a three-factorial 2×2× 3 design (‘genotype’, ‘regulation’ and ‘valence’) with nonsphericity correction to account for unequal variances was set up using SPMs “full-factorial model”. To test whether the experimental manipulation was successful, the effects of valence and condition collapsed across genotypes were compared. Subsequently, the inﬂuence of valence and regulation was compared between genotype groups. Masking of the a priori search region was performed with a sphere of 12-mm diameter in the center of both amygdalae (x, y, z=± 26, −4, −16). This region of interest was chosen based on the maxima reported in previous, independent studies regarding the inﬂuence of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on the perception of aversive versus neutral stimuli (Bertolino et al., 2005; Hariri et al., 2002; Heinz et al., 2005; Pezawas et al., 2005). The t-statistics for each individual voxel were considered signiﬁcant at p b0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons on the whole brain level and in the amygdala.  946  D.M. Schardt et al. / NeuroImage 53 (2010) 943–951  Coordinates of cluster maxima were converted from MNI to Talairach space (mni2tal-transform by Matthew Brett, www.mrc-cbu. cam.ac.uk/Imaging/mnispace.html) for labeling according to the Talairach and Tournoux (1988) atlas, but for reasons of accuracy, the original unconverted MNI coordinates will be reported throughout (Chau and McIntosh, 2005; Poldrack et al., 2008).  Functional connectivity analysis  fear.  A post hoc psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis was carried out to elaborate on interactive effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype and the willful regulation of In this analysis, functional connectivity between a seed region and functionally connected regions is assessed through signiﬁcant differences in correlations depending on different tasks (Friston et al., 1997). To this end, individual time series were extracted from the right amygdala using the masking procedure described above. The right amygdala was chosen as the seed region for this analysis because an inﬂuence of cognitive regulation on amygdala hyperreactivity to fear was only found in the right but not in the left amygdala. The physiological variable (amygdala ROI time-course), the psychological variable (regulation versus perception of fear) and their interaction term along with the movement parameters were entered into a ﬁrstlevel ﬁxed-effects model in SPM5. The resulting contrast weights of the interaction term were then entered into a second-level ANOVA to compare amygdala coupling between the s-group and the l-group. Non-sphericity correction was applied to account for unequal variances. Voxel level t-statistics were considered signiﬁcant at an initial threshold of p b0.005 uncorrected; for a priori regions of interest, we used a small volume correction similar to the approach reported in Eippert et al. (2009), with p-values ≤0.05 FWEcorrected for small volume. The peak coordinates for these corrections were extracted from previous studies on the effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype or cognitive emotion regulation on the amygdala. Correction of the vlPFC (Goldin et al., 2008) was achieved using a sphere of 14-mm radius. Spheres with 10-mm radius for correction of the sACC (Pezawas et al., 2005), rACC (Heinz et al., 2005) and dmPFC (Ochsner et al., 2002) were applied. The diameters of the spheres were chosen according to anatomical constraints. As stated above, the original MNI coordinates of cluster maxima will be reported.  Results  Behavioral results  Personality scores  The 5-HTTLPR genotype groups did not differ regarding harm avoidance or neuroticism scores (HA: t[35]=−1.55, p=0.13; N: t[35]=−1.66, p=0.11). The habitual use of suppression was also unaffected by 5-HTTLPR genotype (ERQ-S: t[35]=0.63, p =0.53). However, the habitual use of reappraisal was more frequent in l/lhomozygotes compared with 5-HTTLPR s-allele carriers (t[35]= −2.42, p=0.02).  s-carriers and l/l-homozygotes (compliance: t[35]=−0.30, p =0.76; success: t[35]=1.46, p=0.15).  Brain imaging results  Overall BOLD signal changes during perception and cognitive regulation of negative cues  For the assessment of the overall effects of valence and regulation, the neural responses to the perception of and the detachment from aversive stimuli were compared collapsed across genotype groups. Functional imaging data revealed a signiﬁcant (p b0.05 FWEcorrected for multiple comparisons) main effect of valence in the bilateral amygdala, where the BOLD signal was higher following both fear and disgust stimuli as compared to neutral stimuli. The main effect of the cognitive regulation of emotion yielded effective signal attenuations in the bilateral amygdala, while signal increases were observed in the dlPFC (BA 9), vlPFC (BA 47/10), the inferior (IPL, BA 40) and superior (SPL, BA 7) parietal lobule and the dmPFC (BA 8). Additional information on activated regions can be obtained from Table 1.  Comparison of amygdala activation between 5-HTTLPR genotype groups Neural responses of s-carriers and l/l-homozygotes were compared regarding the perception of fear, disgust and neutral stimuli within our a priori region of interest in the bilateral amygdala (p b0.05 FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons). Subsequently, the inﬂuence of the cognitive regulation of fear and disgust on amygdala reactivity was compared between s-allele carriers and the group of l/l-homozygotes.  Amygdala hyperreactivity was observed in individuals with the 5-HTTLPR short variant. In s-allele carriers, the passive viewing of pictures that induce fear entailed greater activation in the right amygdala compared with neutral stimuli (x, y, z=26, −4, −18, t=2.87, p=0.037), while amygdala activation to the perception of disgust versus neutral stimuli did not differ between the two 5HTTLPR genotype groups. Moreover, the bilateral amygdala of s-carriers showed higher activation to fear compared with disgust perception (left: x, y, z=−28, −8, −18, t=2.77, p=0.047; right: x, y, z=26, −4, −20, t= 2.97, p=0.029). Despite the amygdala hyperreactivity to fear, effective signal attenuation was observed in response to detachment in individuals with the 5-HTTLPR short variant (x, y, z=26, −2, −12, t=3.27, p=0.013): s-carriers showed larger signal reductions in the right amygdala during the regulation of fear when compared to l/l-homozygous individuals (Fig. 1). Again, no comparable effect was observed for the cognitive regulation of disgust. For more information on activated regions, see Supplemental material online.  In an exploratory analysis, we also found evidence that the s-carriers' larger amygdala signal reduction during regulation is valence speciﬁc when we lowered the threshold to an uncorrected p b0.05 for the a priori search region: the amygdala of s-carriers was signiﬁcantly more attenuated during the regulation of fear compared with both disgust ([pF NrF]N[pD NrD]) and neutral stimuli ([pF NrF] N[pX NrX]).  Manipulation check  Both fear and disgust stimuli were perceived as signiﬁcantly more unpleasant in comparison with the neutral stimuli (‘valence’: F[2,70] =402.58, p b0.0001). Subjects attended the regulated stimuli well: when asked to indicate the condition under which a picture had been presented during fMRI, hit rates were higher for the two negative conditions (‘valence’: F[2,70]=5.1, p b0.01) and especially so for the regulated stimuli (‘valence×regulation’: F[2,70]=57.6, p b0.0001). The 5-HTTLPR genotype did not have any effects on pleasantness ratings or hit rates (all p N0.12).  The compliance with and success at implementing emotion regulation was generally very high and did not differ between  5-HTTLPR effects on amygdala functional connectivity during cognitive regulation  To assess amygdala functional connectivity during the cognitive regulation of fear, we performed a psycho-physiological interaction analysis (Friston et al., 1997). Since only the right amygdala showed a 5-HTTLPR effect during both perception and regulation of fear, this region was chosen as the seed region for the psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis. Generally, detachment from fear modulated the functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the dlPFC (BA 9) and vlPFC (BA 47), the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC, BA 10), dorsal ACC (dACC), the medial OFC (mOFC, BA 11) and the dmPFC (BA 6).  D.M.

In a direct comparison between the 5-HTTLPR genotype groups, cognitive regulation had a stronger modulatory inﬂuence on functional connectivity between the amygdala and the bilateral vlPFC (BA 10/47), the left mOFC (BA 11), the subgenual (sACC, BA 25) and the rostral (rACC, BA 32) anterior cingulate cortex in individuals carrying at least one s-allele (Fig. 2). Detailed information on activation for this comparison is reported in Table 2. In contrast, the l-group did not exhibit regions of increased connectivity during cognitive regulation, even when lowering the threshold to an uncorrected p b0.05.  Discussion  Here, we show that heightened amygdala reactivity attributable to the 5-HTTLPR short variant can be successfully attenuated by the willful, cognitive regulation of emotions (Fig. 1), that this effect is present for fear but not observed for disgust, and that it is mediated in s-carriers by altered functional coupling between the amygdala and the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (Fig. 2).  Both fear and disgust induced reliable activation in the amygdala amongst other regions in comparison to emotionally neutral stimuli (Calder et al., 2001; Phan et al., 2002). As expected from the growing body of literature on increased amygdala reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, s-carriers in our study also showed increased amygdala activation during the passive perception of fear versus neutral stimuli (Hariri et al., 2002, 2005). However, the same s-carriers showed no amygdala hyperreaction to disgust, which suggests that the effect of the serotonin transporter genotype on amygdala activation might be modulated by the type of negative emotion evoked by a stimulus; this notion is also supported by the fact that the cognitive regulation of fear led to a larger decrease in amygdala activation in the short allele group (Goldin et al., 2008; Ochsner et al., 2002, 2004). However, these ﬁndings speak against the assumption that emotional regulation is generally compromised in short allele carriers: the amygdala hyperreactivity to fear perception in s-carriers was not present anymore during the cognitive regulation of fear. It is unlikely that this effect is attributable to differences in  948  D.M. Schardt et al. / NeuroImage 53 (2010) 943–951  Fig. 1. Increased amygdala signal attenuation during cognitive emotion regulation in 5-HTTLPR short allele carriers.

Moreover, we found evidence for a neurobiological mechanism mediating this effect in the medial and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Although functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala was previously reported to be decreased in s-carriers in an emotion paradigm without explicit regulation (Pezawas et al., 2005), short allele carriers in the present study were able to effectively down-regulate their hyperreactive amygdalae. This effect was mediated by signiﬁcantly stronger functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices during cognitive regulation. Recent reports have described increased connectivity between the amygdala and the dorsomedial, orbitolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices during willful emotion regulation (Banks et al., 2007; Maren and Quirk, 2004; Wager et al., 2008). Increased connectivity with the prefrontal cortex during cognitive regulation might thus signal stronger inhibitory inﬂuences on the amygdala through direct afferent (rACC) or efferent (sACC, medial OFC) anatomical connections (Paus, 2001; Stefanacci et al., 1996; Stein et al., 2007).  How do the present ﬁndings ﬁt in with the assumption of a detrimental effect of the short allele on emotional regulation? The present results emphasize that a clear distinction must be made between implicit (automatic) and explicit (effortful) processing with respect to the effects of the serotonin transporter genotype on neural processing (MacDonald, 2008; Phillips et al., 2008; Satpute and Lieberman, 2006). The decreased coupling between the amygdala and  the medial prefrontal cortex in s-carriers which has been described previously (Pezawas et al., 2005) was observed when emotional regulation was not an explicit task but occurred instead automatically. In this paradigm, subjects either only viewed negative stimuli, or matched them without the instruction to regulate. In contrast, our task involved the explicit regulation of emotions, which is known to lead to increased coupling of the amygdala and ventromedial (Banks et al., 2007) and ventrolateral (Wager et al., 2008) prefrontal cortices. Thus, the present results suggest that the willful effort to regulate emotions can compensate for amygdala hyperreactivity in 5-HTTLPR s-carriers (Fig. 1), a ﬁnding which is important also with respect to the role of the will in controlling predetermined reactions (Haggard, 2008; Walter, 2001) since it suggests that willful acts can indeed compensate for genetically mediated emotional sensitivity. If the explicit, cognitive regulation of emotions diminishes the amygdala hyperreactivity in s-allele carriers, how can we explain their supposed bias towards negative emotionality? One possible explanation is that s-carriers do not habitually access the full potential of cognitive regulation, as suggested by the lower habitual reappraisal scores in s-carriers in our study. An intensiﬁed experience of negativity in these individuals might critically compromise the implementation of cognitive regulation, particularly when stress is frequently experienced. The repeated exposure to adverse life events depletes cognitive resources and makes successful emotion regulation more difﬁcult (Gross, 1999), which may consequently lead to an increase of depression. At ﬁrst glance, this interpretation may seem difﬁcult to reconcile with the results of two recent meta-analyses which did not ﬁnd an association between an elevated risk for depression and the serotonin transporter genotype alone or in interaction with stressful  Fig. 2.

Increased functional coupling during the cognitive regulation of fear (rF NpF) was observed in 5-HTTLPR s-allele carriers between the right amygdala seed region around x, y, z=26, −4, −16, and the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left medial orbitofrontal cortex, right premotor cortex as well as rostral and subgenual parts of the anterior cingulate cortex.

However, while it is well acknowledged that large and homogeneously assessed samples are necessary to identify gene-environment interactions (Hoefgen et al., 2005), the samples included in the above mentioned meta-analyses are heterogeneous with respect to ethnicity, study design, sample recruitment and assessment of stressful life events. Moreover, the sample size of 1769 clinically depressed individuals may still be too low to identify inﬂuences of the serotonin transporter genotype on a speciﬁc subgroup. Since depression is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and the impact of stressful life events on an individual at a given point in time is hard to determine, a replication within the same study design is needed to reliably provide or refute an association between the serotonin transporter genotype, environmental factors and depression.  In the present design, however, we did not test the direct inﬂuence of the serotonin transporter genotype on depression per se; rather, we examined quantitative measures of phenotypes of the cognitive control of emotions which may underlie the etiology of depression. The relevance of successful emotion regulation with regard to mood disorders is underscored by reports of impaired cognitive emotion regulation in clinically manifest depression. Whereas greater activation in the ventrolateral and ventromedial PFC was associated with reduced amygdala activation in healthy controls, clinically depressed individuals showed the reverse pattern, where greater reappraisal effort was related to increased amygdala activation (Johnstone et al., 2007). In our study, individuals with the risk genotype were able to effectively attenuate amygdala hyperreactivity to fear-related stimuli by means of cognitive regulation. This suggests that explicit strategies may be beneﬁcial in attenuating genotype-dependent amygdala activation, despite a less efﬁcient automatic emotion regulation. In fact, the efﬁcacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for depressed or depression-prone subjects might also rely on this mechanism (Johnstone et al., 2007). Future investigations of 5-HTTLPR effects on neural processing are needed to determine how explicit cognitive as compared to automatic mechanisms of emotion regulation are altered in depressed patients and whether explicit training in emotion regulation strategies alters these effects.  Furthermore, the present sample comprised only female participants, while gender differences have been observed with respect to the behavioral effects of the serotonin transporter genotype and  during cognitive emotion regulation. For example, in women, the 5HTTLPR short genotype led to a more cautious response style and more negative mood during acute tryptophan depletion compared with men (Walderhaug et al., 2007). In a Japanese sample, the effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on anxiety scores were also mediated by gender: female ls heterozygous individuals showed greater anxiety scores than ss or ll homozygous individuals, while in the male subgroup, the ss homozygous individuals showed the highest anxiety scores (Mizuno et al., 2006). McRae and colleagues (2008) reported that although women did not differ from men with respect to the behavioral outcomes of reappraisal, cognitive emotion regulation was associated with greater prefrontal activation and lesser down-regulation in the amygdala in women. The interpretation offered by the authors posits that in men, cognitive emotion regulation may be associated with less effort, possibly due to a greater use of automatic emotion regulation; a conclusion which ﬁts in well with the fact that the prevalence of affective disorders is higher in women (Gater et al., 1998; Kessler et al., 1993; Maciejewski et al., 2001; Wilhelm et al., 1997). Conversely, previous studies of 5-HTTLPR-mediated amygdala activation to negative emotional cues have not found evidence for gender-related differences (Hariri et al., 2002, 2005), suggesting that higher amygdala activation in short allele carriers is independent of gender. Moreover, cognitive regulation led to decreased amygdala activation across both genotype groups in our study, suggesting that the intended strategy is effective in female subjects in general. Since our participants were not recruited at a speciﬁc time during their menstrual cycle, while some studies have found differences in emotional processing related to hormonal changes (Amin et al., 2006; Goldstein et al., 2005; Pearson and Lewis, 2005; Protopopescu et al., 2005), we cannot exclude that our ﬁndings are biased in this respect. However, the genotypedependent modulation of the amygdala activation was observed to be highly signiﬁcant despite the fact that we did not control for menstrual status, which suggests that hormonal changes play no or only a minor role with regard to our ﬁndings. Thus, the present results offer important insights into the effects of cognitive emotion regulation on 5-HTTLPR-mediated amygdala function, while their limited generalizability warrants future studies that control for menstrual cycle as well as a replication within males.  In conclusion, the results of the present study lend new insights into our understanding of the complex interplay between willful  950  D.M. Schardt et al. / NeuroImage 53 (2010) 943–951  efforts and genetic determination. They suggest that genetically predisposed neural processing may be counteracted by willful actions. Furthermore, the present ﬁndings may partly explain why short allele carriers of the 5-HTTLPR are prone to affective disorders in the presence of stressful life events and why cognitive behavioral therapy is effective in improving the willful regulation of emotions. Our ﬁndings generate a new set of research questions concerning the neural, genetic and environmental factors involved in affective disorders as well as effective mechanisms for coping with them. Finally, they also lend support for the thesis that conscious will can effectively counteract genetic determinants of emotional behavior.
